He was identified as Felipe Alonzo-Gomez by US Rep. Joaquin Castro, but CBP did not name him.\n\nThe children's deaths have highlighted the life-and-death challenges that migrants face in attempting to come to the US and caused CBP to announce several policy changes around its care of children under 10 years old.\n\nCBP released the following timeline based on the current understanding of Felipe's final days and the hours leading up to his death late Christmas Eve. The dates and times below are in local time.\n\nDecember 18\n\nAbout 1 p.m.\n\nFelipe was apprehended with his father at a location about 3 miles west of the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso, Texas for illegal entry.\n\nThat apprehension location is a less than 15-minute drive from the Paso Del Norte port, but groups may be detained in the field until transportation is available.\n\n4:39 p.m.\n\nFelipe and his father were transferred to the Paso Del Norte processing center. While detained there, they were provided hot food, snacks, juice, and water, and the agents logged six welfare checks.\n\nDecember 20\n\nNoon\n\nFelipe and his father were transferred to El Paso Border Patrol Station.\n\nOver the next two days, Felipe and his father were provided with showers, food, juice, and water, and the agents logged 17 welfare checks.\n\nDecember 22\n\n11:17 p.m.\n\nBorder Patrol transferred Felipe and his father to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in Alamogordo, New Mexico to finalize processing. They were transferred because of capacity levels at the El Paso station.\n\nAlamogordo is about 80 miles away from the El Paso station.\n\nDecember 23\n\n1:08 a.m.\n\nFelipe and his father arrived at the Alamogordo Station. Upon arrival, they were provided with personal hygiene products and meals, and they received several welfare checks.\n\nDecember 24\n\n5:39 a.m.\n\nA placement request for Felipe and his father was emailed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations.\n\n9 a.m.\n\nA processing agent noticed that the child was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes. About 30 minutes later, based on the agents' observations, Felipe was transferred to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo with possible influenza symptoms. He was accompanied by his father.\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nHospital staff conducted several tests on Felipe for strep throat.\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nFelipe was given a diagnosis of common cold and given Tylenol.\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nHe was evaluated for release and found to have a 103 degree fever and was held for continued observation.\n\n2:50 p.m.\n\nFelipe was released from the emergency room with a prescription for Ibuprofen and amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic.\n\nHe and his father were transported to temporary holding at the Highway 70 checkpoint. While at the checkpoint, Felipe and his father were offered and accepted a hot meal.\n\nAbout 5 p.m.\n\nAgents provided Felipe with a dose of the prescribed medication as ordered by the medical staff, and agents conducted several welfare checks that evening.\n\n7 p.m.\n\nFelipe appeared to be nauseous and vomited. Agents were aware of this and helped clean up the vomit. His father declined further medical assistance as the child had been feeling better.\n\n10 p.m.\n\nFelipe appeared lethargic and nauseous again.\n\nBecause no EMT was on duty, out of caution, agents made the decision to return Felipe and his father to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center.\n\nDuring transportation to the hospital, he began to vomit and lost consciousness.\n\n11:07 p.m.\n\nRadio traffic indicated that the agent had arrived at the medical center, where he was met by hospital staff.\n\n11:48 p.m.\n\nHospital staff were unable to revive Felipe and pronounced him dead.\n\nDecember 25\n\n7:40 a.m.\n\nThe Guatemalan Consulate was contacted about the child's death. His father is currently detained at the Alamogordo Station pending transfer to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. He has spoken to his spouse in Guatemala and the Guatemalan Consulate.\n\n4:01 p.m.\n\nThe Guatemalan Foreign Ministry issues a statement that it was alerted to a minor's death in the US. Guatemala's Consul General in Phoenix Oscar Padilla Lam traveled to Alamogordo to meet with the boy's father to \"hear his version of the facts,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said it will provide all assistance and consular protection to the boy's father and assume responsibility for the repatriation of the boy's remains."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Border Patrol announces changes after second migrant child dies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nBzyzCTNYbU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An 8-year-old Guatemalan boy died late Christmas Eve in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection, the agency said, the second Guatemalan child to die in the agency's custody this month.\n\nRep.

McAleenan said. \"On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family.\"\n\nThe boy was taken to the hospital Monday after a border agent noticed signs of illness, and the medical staff first diagnosed him with a common cold and later detected a fever.\n\n\"The child was held for an additional 90 minutes for observation and then released from the hospital mid-afternoon on December 24 with prescriptions for amoxicillin and Ibuprofen,\" CBP said in a news release.

CBP is conducting a review and will release more details as they become available, it said.\n\nCBP announces policy changes in wake of death\n\nIn the wake of the boy's death, McAleenan announced a series of moves on Tuesday night.\n\nFirst, Border Patrol is conducting secondary medical checks on all children in CBP care and custody with a particular focus on children under 10.\n\nSecond, Border Patrol is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on available surge options for transportation to Family Residential Centers and supervised release, CBP said. The agency also is reviewing other custody options to relieve capacity issues in the El Paso sector, such as working with nongovernmental organizations or local partners for temporary housing.\n\nThird, CBP is considering options for medical assistance with other governmental partners, the agency said. That could include support from the Coast Guard, as well as possibly more aid from the Department of Defense, FEMA, Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFinally, CBP is reviewing its policies with a particular focus on the care and custody of children under 10, both at intake and beyond 24 hours in custody, the agency said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Castro offered his condolences to the boy's family and called for a congressional investigation of the death.\n\n\"While the CBP notified Congress within 24 hours as mandated by law, we must ensure that we treat migrants and asylum-seekers with human dignity and provide the necessary medical care to anyone in the custody of the United States government,\" he said in the statement.\n\nGuatemala's Foreign Ministry in a statement Tuesday also asked for an investigation and access to the boy's medical records.\n\nThe ministry said CBP alerted Guatemalan officials of the death on Tuesday. The boy arrived in El Paso with his father December 18 and was transferred to the Alamogordo CBP station on Sunday, according to the statement.\n\n\"The cause of death of the minor is still being investigated and the medical records have been requested in order to help clarify the cause of death,\" the statement said.\n\nGuatemala's Consul General in Phoenix, Oscar Padilla Lam, met with the boy's father in Almagordo to \"hear his version of the facts,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said it will provide assistance and consular protection to the father and assume responsibility for the repatriation of the boy's remains.\n\nThe CBP news release says the Department of Homeland Security is experiencing \"a dramatic increase in unaccompanied children and family units arriving at our borders illegally or without authorization,\" and per law, holds such individuals at federal facilities until they are deported or released into the United States with a notice to appear in court.\n\n\"During their period of detention they received medical screenings and further treatment as needed,\" it said.\n\n7-year-old Guatemalan girl died earlier this month\n\nJUST WATCHED Attorneys: Migrant girl not provided water Replay More Videos ...

Our need for resources is greater. Our expectations more immediate. And while our capacity for change is elastic, this planet's provision for that change is finite.\n\nThe generation that never had it so good risks handing off the hangover of its excess and inaction to its children.\n\nTo know 2019, look across Europe in 2018.\n\nActivism is on the rise. New and savvy social media movements are gaining momentum, from climate change demonstrators shutting down central London to \"yellow jacket\" protesters opposed to climate control legislation ripping up central Paris.\n\nFor each ugly manifestation of street anger, a chilling iceberg of discontent lurks below the surface. Brexit is a case in point: It captured popular imagination as a way to control immigration, among other things, but is now tearing up Europe's cohesion.\n\nWhat began 2018 as an already messy divorce has descended into bitter cross-channel vitriol that will only get worse next year.\n\nEurope suddenly looks shaky.\n\nThat alone might not be so bad for global stability were it not for the fact that the United States, the nation that shaped today's Europe, is turning its back on the continent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump made clear in 2018 that he doesn't much care for Europe. He undermined British Prime Minister Theresa May, lambasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has been openly hostile to French President Emmanuel Macron. In short, he is shunning America's natural allies.\n\nTrump is turning 2019 from a potentially treacherous year into a downright dangerous one -- and not just because of Europe.\n\nHe has raised tensions with China and engaged in the farcical and dangerous delusions of defanging Kim Jong Un of his nuclear weapons. He has appeased Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and cozied up to Vladimir Putin while sanctioning Russia.\n\nBut perhaps most destructively, by shunning his Defence Chief James Mattis out of office, he has lifted the brake on his most misguided overseas impulses. By drawing down US forces in Syria to zero and Afghanistan to half, he has exposed his paltry grasp on what actually keeps Americans, their interests, and global stability on an even keel.\n\nJUST WATCHED Stocks plunge on US-China trade tension Replay More Videos ...

This is at least something for which he has global backing. But his wild behavior in other areas undermines this.\n\nAllies such as Saudi Arabia, aided by sophisticated first world consultancies, have found his weaknesses: overly simplified foreign and transactional relationships, such as the weapons sales he cited when failing to hold bin Salman to account in Khashoggi's killing.\n\nHe occupied a large place on the global stage in 2018. Not just because he is the most powerful man on the planet, but because the way he wielded that power has been polarizing.\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote that we are drifting apart, that Trump is an accelerant in the populist politics of division.\n\nAs the year draws to a close and Trump faces a 2019 looking inward to the myriad investigations he faces at home, he will no doubt turn his back on surging global turbulence.\n\nChina's global ambitions rise, Putin needles his neighbors, Kim is the nuclear can still being kicked down the road, and Iran seethes at new US sanctions and girds for a regional showdown with Saudi Arabia.\n\nEver since Trump took office, it was assumed that Europe would uphold the international order. But the Old Continent faces enough of its own threats on many fronts in 2019: Putin to the East, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the south, Trump to the west. Yet its own internal problems weaken it the most.\n\nJust a year ago, France's Macron seemed special, a fresh generation of thinking offering a seductively broad political church, riding high in the polls. Fast-forward to now, and his popularity has plummeted.\n\nIn Germany, Merkel, once Europe's much applauded moral compass, has been replaced as party chief and rendered a lame-duck Chancellor.\n\nAnd in the UK, May's handling of Brexit has forced her to surrender political ambition to keep her job.\n\nJUST WATCHED Does the UK need a new political party?

With a little more than three months until Brexit day, May uncharacteristically got in the face of the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker, challenging him about what he may or may not have said about her. Later he uncharacteristically warned Britain's lawmakers to dial back anti-European Union rhetoric.\n\nIt's a sign of how far things have come in a year, and a warning of where they could go in 2019.\n\nBrexit negotiations were always going to be tense. The logical brake on all of that would have been the United States.\n\nThe idea now that Trump has the desire, ability or credibility to wrap his arms around this issue -- or any simmering global spat -- is beyond improbable.\n\nAbsent of America's positive influence on global affairs, Trump's populist style of politics, increasingly aped by other leaders, will leave us all longing for bygone certainties and stability.\n\nThe world is more interlinked and interdependent than at any time in history: From the toe bone to the head bone, we are connected and can ill afford the fractures that could await us next year.\n\nIt has taken two generations to repair the last global unraveling of the Second World War.

Howell quoted emotional lines of testimony from Warmbier's mother and recounted grim details of his treatment in North Korea that underpinned the judgment.\n\n\"An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States,\" Howell wrote.\n\nNorth Korean officials detained Warmbier in 2016 as he tried to leave the country after spending five days there on a commercial tour.

George W. Bush spent the holiday at Camp David during his eight years in office, while Barack Obama traveled to his native Hawaii.\n\n\"I love the White House, but I wasn't able to be with my family. I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family, my family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting,\" Trump explained on Tuesday -- speaking presumably about his adult children, since first lady Melania Trump returned to the White House on Monday to spend the holiday with him.\n\nHe claimed, without evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall -- and support him in his mission.\n\n\"Many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall,\" he claimed, though didn't identify who the workers were.\n\nHe insisted in lengthy remarks the prolonged shutdown was the fault of Democrats, and repeated his demands a border barrier be funded before the government can reopen. In a sign the deadlock will continue, Trump announced he would travel to Texas in late January to observe part of the wall being built.\n\nBut he did not offer any new method of getting Democrats to sign off on funding, beyond saying he was always willing to meet with Democratic leaders Sen.

The Democrats hated him. They were calling for his resignation. They were calling for his firing,\" Trump said. Some Democrats faulted Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Later, Trump's firing of Comey was viewed by many Democrats as a way to short-circuit the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\n\"Once I fired him, everybody said, 'Oh, why did you fire him, why did you fire him?'\" Trump said, waving his hands in irritation."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says no end to shutdown until border barrier funded", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MKdAoqfllUc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday the government won't reopen until funding is secured for his border barrier, and he plans to go to the border in January to visit a new stretch of wall.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open.

James Mattis' resignation triggered an outpouring of anxiety and anger and a steady stream of kudos for the 68-year-old, but as the shock of his departure begins to ebb, another narrative about the \"warrior monk\" is emerging.\n\nEven as Mattis is being hailed as a \"national treasure\" and praised for his moral compass and \"sound judgment,\" conversations with multiple US defense officials reflect a frustration with the outgoing defense secretary.\n\nWhile some of these frustrations are being overshadowed by President Donald Trump's decision to push Mattis out of his post on January 1, two months earlier than originally planned, these sources suggest that the general's tendency to exert tight control may have contributed to the crisis surrounding Trump's precipitous decision Wednesday to end the US military presence in Syria and scale it back in Afghanistan.\n\nMattis resigned in disagreement over Trump's Syria decision, which will likely empower Russia and Iran and leave Syrian Kurds -- staunch US allies -- at risk from both ISIS and Turkey. The Associated Press, citing US and Turkish officials, first reported that the President agreed to the withdrawal in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week without consulting his national security team or US allies.\n\nAt odds for months\n\nMattis' resignation capped an extended period of tension with the President, though fundamental differences have long existed. Mattis is a 68-year-old who has devoted his life to the military. Trump, meanwhile, is a 72-year-old who is drawn to heroic military figures but repeatedly sidestepped the draft as a young man and has yet to make the customary presidential visit to troops in overseas combat zones.\n\nSeveral administration officials tell CNN they believe that if, in fact, Mattis and Trump had been at odds for months, the secretary had an obligation to leave far earlier than he did. He waited too long to act and now, they say, the Kurds will pay the price.\n\nThese officials argue that if Mattis had left after Trump dismissively referred to him in an October interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" as \"sort of a Democrat,\" there could have been another defense secretary in place who might have been able to talk the President out of the troop drawdown.\n\n\"Writing a formal letter and presenting it to the boss personally was exactly the right thing to do. It is very much in keeping with military custom.,\" said John Kirby, CNN's military and diplomatic affairs analyst and a retired rear admiral. But, he added, \"Having that letter be so long and philosophical, reading almost as a manifesto of sorts, and then aggressively pushing it out to media outlets shortly after delivery came across as little more than a shot at redemption and a chance to get ahead of Trump's spin.\"\n\nBut Mattis is the same person he has always been, the officials said, none of whom are Trump supporters. They portray the secretary as driven by his own views and determination to stay on the job while trying to keep from angering Trump, and they add that the very public orchestration of his departure is not going down well in some military circles.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n\nA US defense official said Trump has pushed a bold agenda, which Mattis helped shape. He convinced Trump to launch a new Afghanistan and South Asia strategy calling for increased troop levels and more military autonomy, helped bring together a coalition to defeat ISIS, and was the first in the administration to call for increased defense spending by NATO members, the official said.\n\n\"The President was the only one elected and must execute his agenda. To do that, he needs people who share his point of view. When the secretary determined he was no longer well aligned with the President, he rendered his resignation,\" according to a US defense official. \"There is a long list of former and current administration officials, lawmakers and others who try and have tried to convince the President to make different decisions, but President Trump is his own man. And so is Jim Mattis.\"\n\nThe Defense Department has posted Mattis' resignation letter on Facebook and on its website. Some see this as a disrespectful dig at the President. And multiple defense officials are eagerly backgrounding reporters, saying more officials will also resign although no Defense Department personnel have so far done so.\n\nIndeed, a military official who regularly talks to Mattis called his letter \"a dog whistle\" to anyone in uniform but particularly for the general officer corps, which should consider it a signal to resign if they also have issues with Trump's policies.\n\nWhile there's no sign at this point of any officer resignations, Brett McGurk -- the American envoy to the coalition to fight ISIS -- also resigned on Friday over Trump's decision to pull US forces out of Syria.\n\nOne defense official pointed to an essential part of Mattis' departure, saying the secretary's exit might be a relief for some.\n\nMattis restricted access to information and put a chill on members of the military services talking publicly. Some might be relieved to see him go if they are now freer to push publicly for their agendas, the official said.\n\nMattis also discouraged senior officers from interacting directly with the President, worried that Trump might suddenly issue them orders -- senior officers would have had no option but to do as Trump wished, according to a defense official.\n\nRunning out of steam\n\nSenior battlefield commanders who have had a chance to meet with the President have been dismayed that he had no questions for them and showed a lack of interest, CNN can confirm.\n\nMattis' own strategy for dealing with Trump eventually ran out of runway. He avoided speaking publicly for fear of getting crosswise with Trump or being seen in contradiction. He also tried delaying tactics on issues such as the Syria withdrawal, which had been on the table all year.\n\nFollowing Mattis' tenure, officials speculate that Trump is unlikely to turn to another retired general to become the next secretary of defense.\n\nTwo names that been thrown about to be the next defense secretary are Mark Esper, the Army secretary, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has already been appointed as acting secretary.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they fare any better than Mattis."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump: Democratic oversight of my administration could amount to 'presidential harassment'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GJKJN4C_Vpk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Democratic attempts at oversight in the coming Congress could amount to \"presidential harassment.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office, Trump again denied any collusion between his team and Russia when he was questioned about the investigative powers Democrats will assume come January.\n\n\"It's probably presidential harassment and we know how to handle that.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis.

They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Japan whale hunting: Commercial whaling to restart in July", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46682976", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Japan will be free to hunt whales like the minke for commercial purposes from July onwards\n\nJapan says it is to restart commercial whaling in July in a move that is likely to draw international criticism.\n\nIt said it would withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the body tasked with whale conservation.\n\nCommercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986 after some species were driven almost to extinction.\n\nOfficials in Japan, an IWC member since 1951, say eating whales is part of the country's culture.\n\nFor many years Japan has hunted whales for what it calls \"scientific research\" and to sell the meat, a programme widely criticised by conservationists.\n\nWednesday's announcement had been expected, but conservation groups warn the move will have serious consequences.\n\nIt means Japan will be able to freely hunt species currently protected by the IWC, like minke whales.\n\nWhat did Japan just announce?\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshihide Suga said commercial whaling would be restricted to Japanese territorial waters and economic zones.\n\nAs a result, Japan will stop hunting in Antarctic waters and the southern hemisphere, a prospect conservation groups had welcomed before it was formally confirmed.\n\nA statement by Japan's government said the IWC was not committed enough to one of its goals, of supporting sustainable commercial whaling.\n\nIt accused the IWC of being focused only on the aim of conserving numbers.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Sushi made of whale meat and blubber sold in Miyagi prefecture\n\nA number of coastal communities in Japan have hunted whales for centuries, but consumption in the country surged only after World War Two when whales were the main source of meat.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards.\n\n\"We'll be working with TSC clinics across

Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.\n\nBut some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.\n\nThis would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.\n\nBut it would also be hugely expensive and require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.\n\nOther climate change stories from 2018\n\nThe earliest animals\n\nImage copyright ANU\n\nThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.\n\nOther palaeontology stories from 2018\n\nGiant plastic 'berg\n\nThe world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.\n\nIn April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic 'berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles.

One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water.

Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean.

But a small, invasive wasp from China is threatening the chestnut harvest in Spain.\n\nNow government scientists are considering releasing another non-native insect into the environment to keep the wasp population under control.\n\nUnder the dense green cover of the Genal Valley in southern Spain, Julio Ruiz, a thirty-something farmer is collecting sweet chestnuts (casta\u00f1as) with his father, mother and brother.\n\nThey are picking up the prickly nuts from the leaf-strewn earth, recognising through experience those that will contain the prized, large-sized chestnut.\n\nBut this year there are far fewer chestnuts to gather not just on the Ruiz family's 30-hectare farm, but throughout the 4,000 hectares of the lush Genal Valley famed for its plentiful chestnuts thanks to its micro-climate.\n\n\"We've lost at least 30% of our usual production,\" explains Julio. \"It is all the fault of a small wasp. You can't tell there's anything wrong until the damage has been done.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A micro-climate in the 400-hectare valley is said to contribute to its success at growing chestnuts\n\nAt the nearby co-operative collection point and weighing station talk is of little else. The chestnut gall wasp, Dryoscomus kuriphillus katsumatsu (avispilla in local Spanish), is causing huge environmental and economic damage in the Valley where the harvest accounts for 10 million euros' worth of income annually.\n\n\"We may be the biggest producers of chestnuts in Andalucia,\" says Felipe Javier Cabos Aguilar, president of the regional association of chestnut producers shaking his head sadly.\n\n\"But that just means we are the most vulnerable.\"\n\nAccording to Antonio Pulido, a forest engineer who has been overseeing the fight against the pest, the avispilla is a parasitic insect that comes from China.\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Antonio Pulido and Julio Ruiz inspecs an infected chestnut tree\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption A chestnut bud damaged by the Chinese wasp\n\n\"It's considered an exotic species that has no natural indigenous predators,\" he says.\n\n\"The main infestation is in the bud where growth is stunted. As a result the flowers and fruit cannot develop and the health and vitality of the tree is compromised. Every variety of chestnut is affected.\"\n\nOver the last three years since the infestation first arrived in the area, countless trees have died. Over the generations each plot of land, or finca, has been divided between offspring with the chestnut proving the most lucrative of all the crops.\n\nAlthough cork and other trees grow in abundance, most farmers depend on chestnuts that are exported to France for specialist processing.\n\nIn order to limit the damage, some farmers are burning the infected trees to protect those who aren't affected. \"This is increasing the risk of forest fires,\" says Antonio Pulido.\n\n\"It is also adding to urban drift as young people in the villages see their future disappearing in front of their eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Here, sweet chestnuts are prepared at a local restaurant. They are also a major export\n\nCastanea sativa, called the sweet chestnut to distinguish it from the horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanus (to which it is only distantly related), offers the region unique potential.\n\nIt is already part of the trend for replacement protein for the sizeable vegan and vegetarian markets of northern Europe.\n\nNow that potential uplift for a impoverished part of a poor region of Spain is under threat.\n\nIn Malaga, at the laboratories of IFAPA-Churriana - an agriculture and fisheries investigation unit of the Andalucian Government (Junta de Andalucia), Juan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo is looking under the microscope at Torimus sinensis, the natural predator of the avispilla.\n\nIt also comes from China. He confirms that this parasitoid insect is capable of helping keep the spread of the infestation under control.\n\nThe Chinese predator has had a high rate of success in Japan, Italy and North America where the infestation appeared prior to arriving in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHowever, he remains hesitant about releasing the predator into the Genal Valley.\n\n\"The problem of introducing a further exotic species such as Torimus sinensis is that it can invade the natural woodland, attack indigenous species, displace others and alter the overall biodiversity,\" he cautions.\n\nImage copyright Gyorgy Csoka, Hungary Forest Research Institute, B Image caption The oriental chestnut gall wasp has already appeared in other regions of the world, such as North America\n\nAlthough the unforeseen repercussions might have a negative impact, there has been a limited release of a tiny number of the predator species in the Genal Valley.\n\nJuan-Ramon Boyero Gallardo says he is optimistic that Torimus sinensis and local predators will slow down the spread of the avispilla.\n\nHe views the plague (plaga in local Spanish) as just another example of the disadvantages of globalisation.\n\n\"We know that the United States have very strict controls over bringing vegetation in to the country, yet they too have been infested\" he says.\n\n\"With container-loads of produce arriving in the port of Malaga from lots of different countries around the world, there is little we can do to prevent the arrival of exotic species.\"\n\nHe goes on to comment: \"If we take a wider view this is another example of the unintentional globalisation of parasites and the problems facing scientists as they search for ways of eradicating, or at least limiting the pest,\" he says.\n\nHowever the more pressing need is to prevent the mass destruction of chestnut trees and uphold the economy of the Genal Valley - not to mention the supply of chestnut stuffing and the luxury marrons glaces so beloved at Christmas."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Sending astronauts to Mars would be stupid, astronaut says", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46364179", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Bill Anders on Apollo 8 in December 1968\n\nOne of the first men to orbit the Moon has told BBC Radio 5 Live that it's \"stupid\" to plan human missions to Mars.\n\nBill Anders, lunar module pilot of Apollo 8, the first human spaceflight to leave Earth's orbit, said sending crews to Mars was \"almost ridiculous\".\n\nNasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon.\n\nIt wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars.\n\nImage caption Bill Anders today. He says Nasa shouldn't be aiming to send manned missions to Mars\n\nAnders, 85, said he's a \"big supporter\" of the \"remarkable\" unmanned programmes, \"mainly because they're much cheaper\". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions.\n\n\"What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?\" he said, adding \"I don't think the public is that interested\".\n\nMeanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars. Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia.\n\nIn a statement, Nasa said it was \"leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars\".\n\n\"That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept.\n\nIn December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon.\n\nThe crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth.\n\nThey splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown.\n\nIt was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later.\n\nBut the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The famous Earthrise image taken from Apollo 8\n\n\"Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected.\"\n\nAnders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. \"I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,\" he said.\n\n\"The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings.\"\n\nIt's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community.\n\n\"I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Apollo 8 astronauts prepare for launch\n\nHis former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic.\n\n\"I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,\" he told 5 Live. \"I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that.\"\n\nBut asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary.\n\n\"I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense.\"\n\nApollo's legacy\n\nReflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a \"great endeavour\" and agreed that it had won the space race.\n\nAnders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be \"Earthrise\" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: \"When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose here\u2026 it sort of dawned me,\" he said.\n\n\"And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform. How the play turns out, is up to us.\"\n\nFrank Borman and Bill Anders were speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live as part of a special documentary on the 50th anniversary of their historic lunar mission.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "The Holidays and US Presidential Pets", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4716357.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Whether it be Millie, Socks or Bo, presidential pets have occupied the White House for more than a century, the tradition being broken by President Donald Trump.

The S&P 500 has lost about 19.8 percent from its Sept. 20 closing high, just shy of the 20 percent threshold that commonly defines a bear market.\n\nMnuchin also spoke on Sunday with the heads of the six largest U.S. banks, who confirmed they have enough liquidity to continue lending and that \"the markets continue to function properly.\"\n\nInvestors said his move to convene a call with the president's Working Group on Financial Markets, known as the \"Plunge Protection team,\" may have weighed on sentiment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump praised U.S. companies and said their lower stock prices present an opportunity for investors. \"I have great confidence in our companies. We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well. They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy.\"\n\nU.S. stocks have dropped sharply in recent weeks on concerns over weaker economic growth. Trump has largely laid the blame for economic headwinds on the Fed, openly criticizing its chairman, Jerome Powell, whom he appointed.\n\n\"They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon,\" Trump said, repeating his criticism.\n\nMedia reports have suggested Trump has gone as far as discussing firing Powell, and he told Reuters in August that he was \"not thrilled\" with the chairman.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said \"The only problem our economy has is the Fed.\"\n\nThe Fed hiked interest rates again last week, as had been widely expected."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump: Shutdown Won't End Until Wall Funded", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reiterates-government-shutdown-will-not-end-until-demand-for-wall-funding-is-met/4715450.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "The partial shutdown of the U.S. government has moved no closer to a resolution, with President Donald Trump asserting on Tuesday the shutdown will continue until his demand for funds to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall are met.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it,\" Trump said in the Oval Office after a video conference with U.S. troops, who are stationed overseas.\n\nTrump claimed the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed due to the shutdown also want the wall, despite a lack of evidence supporting the contention.\n\nOn Monday, Trump asserted Democrats \"must end\" the standoff while Democratic leaders in Congress blamed Trump for \"plunging the country into chaos.\"\n\nThe two sides traded their accusations ahead of Christmas, the fourth day in which parts of the government are closed because Congress and Trump have not been able to agree on necessary spending legislation.\n\nWhile government agencies dealing with national security and public safety remain open, other offices are closed and 800,000 federal workers are on furlough.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told The Associated Press.\n\n\n\nOn the domestic front, no sooner had Trump signaled he might be backing off his demand for $5 billion to build a border wall with Mexico \u2014 easing away from a partial government shutdown \u2014 than he took a U-turn after being scolded by conservative allies and pundits, who accused him of wavering on a campaign promise. Now, three days into the shutdown, his budget chief says it could drag into the New Year.\n\n\n\nOn issues abroad, Trump acted against the advice of his national security advisers and issued a surprise decision to pull troops from Syria. That prompted Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to step down and Trump's special envoy to the coalition fighting Islamic State militants, Brett McGurk, to resign. A drawdown of troops in Afghanistan also appeared to be in the works.\n\n\n\nAs the stock market tumbled on Christmas Eve, Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve sowing more uncertainty over his public criticism of chairman Jerome Powell.\n\n\n\nNow, as Republicans prepare to relinquish their hold on government, with Democrats taking control of the House in January, the opportunities \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the GOP alliance with the Trump White House may be running their course.\n\n\n\n\"I am all alone [poor me] in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal,'' the president tweeted.\n\n\n\nOver and again, Trump has shown himself to be more of a tactical, than strategic, thinker, acting to avoid short-term pain rather than seeking long-term gain.\n\nWhen Congress was about to keep the government running without a fight over border wall money, Trump felt the outcry from his base and intervened.\n\n\n\nTrump told House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders at the White House he wouldn't sign a Senate-passed compromise bill, which would have kept border security money at $1.3 billion, not the $5 billion he wanted for the wall with Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe House and Senate gaveled in for a brief Christmas Eve session Monday only to close up quickly for the holidays.\n\n\n\n\"Trump is plunging the country into chaos,\" the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. \"Instead of bringing certainty into people's lives, he's continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts.\"\n\n\n\nTrump's sudden moves on Syria left top Republicans on Capitol Hill criticizing his decision to pull out all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., signed on to a letter with other GOP senators urging Trump to reconsider.\n\n\n\nGraham used a weekend luncheon with conservative lawmakers at the White House to impress on the president the rightness of his instinct on both the border wall and the troop withdrawal in Syria, while also sharing with Trump some ideas for smoothing the policy around both issues.\n\n\n\n\"I told the president, I'm not arguing with your general philosophy,\" Graham said. \"He's a good listener.\"\n\n\n\nGraham reminded Trump that while shoring up the border wall is important, \"a Southern wall isn't going to protect you against ISIS.\"\n\n\n\nIt's unclear if Trump was listening. The Pentagon said Monday that Mattis has already signed the order to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria.\n\n\n\nAnd Mattis, who was also unhappy with Trump's order to develop plans to pull out half of the 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, was being pushed out two months early. Irritated by a surge of criticism over his decision, Trump said Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary on Jan. 1.\n\n\n\nTrump's allies chock up the president's year-end moves to a wager that the intense support from his base of voters will continue to propel his electoral chances in 2020 \u2014 even if polling suggests otherwise.\n\n\n\nAn analysis of VoteCast, a nationwide poll of more than 115,000 midterm voters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago, highlights the fractures.\n\n\n\nA small, but significant slice of voters \u2014 the 18 percent who described themselves as only \"somewhat\" approving of the president \u2014 expressed concerns.\n\n\n\nCompared with the 27 percent of voters who describe themselves as strong Trump supporters, the \"somewhat\" Trump voters are much more likely to disapprove of Trump on key issues and have reservations about his personality.\n\n\n\nIn a warning signs for Republicans, who just lost their House majority in the November election, those voters are more likely to have voted for Democrats in 2018. They are more educated, somewhat more likely to be women, and more likely to live in suburbs.\n\n\n\nThe president has been busy on the phone to allies on Capitol Hill, talking late into the night with some.\n\n\n\nTrump seemed \"exuberant\" at the luncheon, said one Republican, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who was the only member of the GOP leadership to attend.\n\n\n\nRyan, who is retiring, and McConnell have become almost side actors to the year-end shutdown they both tried to avoid, but now will partly own. Both offices said it was up to Trump and Democrats to cut a deal.\n\n\n\nShelby said that at lunch Trump did seem like he wanted to reach a deal. At the same time, it's not always clear whether any of the hours of conversation result in decisions that drift too far from Trump's own instinct to stay close to his base.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it's imminent we're going to reach a deal,\" Shelby said. \"I wish we could.\"\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Russian Law Enforcement Investigate ISS Capsule Hole", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-law-enforcement-investigate-international-iss-capsule-hole/4713922.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "A Russian cosmonaut who explored a mysterious hole in a capsule docked to the International Space Station says Russian law enforcement agencies are investigating what caused the opening.\n\nSergei Prokopyev said Monday investigators were looking at samples he and crewmate Oleg Kononenko collected during a December 12 spacewalk.

That was the beginning of a long legal and physical journey for the world\u2019s largest Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton. Known as Sue, named for paleontologist Sue Hendrickson who discovered it, the well-preserved specimen arrived as the star attraction in Stanley Hall at the Field Museum in 2000.\n\nBut scientists only recently learned how the belly ribs fit onto the overall specimen, which now fundamentally changes what we know about the Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nAfter a nearly year-long transition to a new exhibit specifically designed for her, Sue will look different to the millions who have seen the dinosaur before.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize that Sue weighed nine tons in real life,\u201d says Hilary Hansen, project manager at the Field Museum. \u201cI think really adding this gastralia, these belly ribs, really changes the profile for Sue, and you can get a sense of how formidable and imposing it must have been to share an environment with this animal.\u201d\n\nHansen explains that the new exhibit doesn\u2019t just change our understanding of the animal itself, such as the fact it probably couldn\u2019t run, but it also show visitors Sue\u2019s natural environment, and place in history.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is bring together everything about Sue that was all over the museum into one space so our visitors can see this as a one stop shop for all things Sue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt pushes what we know about T-Rex forward,\u201d says Hoogstraten, including possible answers to how Sue met her fate.\n\n\u201cOne possibility is that there was an infection, and that she possibly starved to death.\u201d\n\nThe Field museum typically welcomes over one million visitors a year, a number Hilary Hansen expects to spike when the new Sue exhibit opens to the public just in time for the holiday rush.\n\n\u201cFor the next three weeks or so, we\u2019re expecting between seven to ten thousand visitors coming through a day.\u201d Some, revisiting an old friend with a new look.\n\nBut even though science marches on, one mystery about Sue remains.\n\nDespite the name, experts are still not sure if the dinosaur behind this fossil was male or female."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "In South Africa, HIV's Patients Survive Disease But Are Weary of Its Toll", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713593.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "South Africa has the world's largest antiretroviral therapy program with over 4 million people receiving treatment.

That's why, when it comes to social media, she thinks more civil servants need to catch up with the rest of the country.\n\n\"Social media, especially the Facebook application, is really used a lot in Vietnam,\" said Chi, who is deputy head of the province's investment promotion and support office. \"But for public agencies that use it as a tool to interact with people and businesses, it's still not necessarily used a lot.\"\n\nFacebook on charm offensive\n\nEven as governments around the world are demanding more accountability and transparency from Facebook, public officials in Vietnam are looking for more ways to use the website. And Facebook is happy to oblige.\n\nThe company is on something of a charm offensive in Vietnam, where it has roughly 42 million members, nearly half the country. Besides sending top officials to visit Vietnam last year, Facebook has been instructing small businesses on how to sell their products on the site, and now it is giving civil servants like Chi advice for engaging with the public.\n\nThe chance to win some good will in Vietnam comes at a time when pressures are piling up on Facebook both inside the country and abroad. Globally, it has been accused of complicity in plots to convince voters to vote for Brexit or for candidate Donald Trump, as well as in what the United Nations calls ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The company reportedly paid for research that could damage its critics' and competitors' reputations, as well as gave users' data to dozens of other firms without consent.\n\nNew cyber law\n\nIn Vietnam, the government told advertisers to boycott Facebook and other sites in response to users' postings that criticized the one-party state. Next month, the country will enact a cyber law requiring firms to store data domestically, which Facebook opposes.\n\nBut those troubles were not front and center at a workshop in Ho Chi Minh City this month where a company representative gave bureaucrats tips on making a Facebook page.\n\n\"We have to understand and put more attention to the social aspect of the platform,\" said Noudhy Valdryno, who handles government outreach for Facebook. \"That means you have to understand your followers, who are they, where do they live, what are their interests? Then you can formulate an accurate strategy to engage with your followers.\"\n\nThe workshop included suggestions for government officials, such as posting updates on Facebook at regular intervals, shooting videos vertically to retain the attention of mobile users, and encouraging conversations among followers on the page.\n\nTech companies welcome\n\nThe event was an example of how Vietnamese officials are open to working with the tech company. It is so ubiquitous in the Southeast Asian country that when Vietnamese people say \"social media\" they mean Facebook, and when asked what newspapers they read, they give the answer: Facebook.\n\n\"What we're talking about is effective use of technology in this day and age to achieve our goals,\" said Le Quoc Cuong, vice director of the Ho Chi Minh City department of information and communications. \"What we're looking for is being effective, being engaging and enhancing cooperation between the government and the people.\"\n\nChi says more Facebook data would help her better engage with residents around Quang Ninh, a northeastern province that hugs the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Chinese border on another. She would like regular reports, perhaps every month, with information to help analyze the province's fan page, from key words to number of \"likes.\" So as many people worldwide have begun to decry tech companies for abusing and cashing in on users' data, there are those who still continue to see untapped potential in gathering further data."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "US SpaceX First National Security Mission", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-spacexfirst-national-security-mission/4713597.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:01:59", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSpaceX continues making news in 2018.

Water is coming!\u201d and reciting verses from the Quran as emergency messages were broadcast over mosque speakers.\n\nIt proved to be a false alarm, but a similar frenzy broke out in Tanjung Lesung, another tsunami-stricken area located hours away, as unsettled survivors of the disaster remained traumatized by a tragedy that killed more than 420 people and left thousands homeless.\n\nMeanwhile, Christmas celebrations were replaced by somber prayers, as church leaders called on Christians across Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, to pray for tsunami victims.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nUnlike other tsunamis that have hit disaster-prone Indonesia following large earthquakes, Saturday\u2019s big waves blasted ashore at night without warning. The eruption of Anak Krakatau, or Child of Krakatoa, a volcano in the Sunda Strait, is believed to have created a landslide on the volcano\u2019s slope, displacing a large volume of water that slammed into the islands of Java and Sumatra.\n\nPeople in Sumur village, which has been slow to receive aid due to roads being cut off, remained stunned by how quickly the tsunami hit. The beach, located just a few kilometers from the tourist island of Umang near Java\u2019s western tip, is popular for snorkeling and other water activities. The tsunami decimated the area, ripping houses from their foundations and bulldozing concrete buildings.\n\nScientists have said the tsunami\u2019s waves were recorded in several places at about 1 meter (3.3 feet) high, but residents of Sumur insisted they towered more than 3 meters (10 feet) there. They said a soaring white wall of water roared toward them at high speeds, ripping trees out of the ground by their roots.\n\n\u201cThere was no sign of a tsunami when we were at the beach. The sea didn\u2019t recede,\u201d said Tati Hayati, a housewife, who was enjoying a pleasant evening with 10 other people when the disaster hit. \u201cIt was calm and bright with the full moon.\u201d\n\nWhen she spotted high, fast-moving waves launching toward the shore, she ran to her car and managed to get inside. But she couldn\u2019t outrun it. She said the car was struck by three waves, breaking out the back window and filling the vehicle with gushing water.\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\u201cWe were locked inside. The car was swaying in the waves and we thought we would all die,\u201d Hayati said. \u201cWe almost could not breathe and I almost gave up when I groped the key in the water and managed to open the door, and the water began to recede. We got out of the car and ran to safety.\u201d\n\nThe disaster was compounded because it occurred over a busy holiday weekend before Christmas when many people had fled crowded cities such as Jakarta, Indonesia\u2019s capital, to relax at popular beach areas.\n\nPastor Markus Taekz said Tuesday that his Rahmat Pentecostal Church in the hard-hit area of Carita did not celebrate Christmas with joyous songs this year. Instead, only about 100 people showed up for the service, which usually brings in double that number. Many congregation members had already left the area for locations away from the disaster zone.\n\n\u201cThis is an unusual situation because we have a very bad disaster that killed hundreds of our sisters and brothers in Banten,\u201d Taekz said, referring to the province on Java island. \u201cSo our celebration is full of grief.\u201d\n\nThe death toll climbed to 429 on Tuesday, with more than 1,400 people injured and at least 128 missing, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s Disaster Mitigation Agency.\n\nHe said more than 16,000 people were displaced and that there was an urgent need for heavy equipment in the Sumur subdistrict near Ujung Kulon National Park to help get aid flowing and reach people who may be injured or trapped.\n\nMilitary troops, government personnel and volunteers continued searching along debris-strewn beaches. Yellow, orange and black body bags were laid out where victims were found, and weeping relatives identified the dead. Many searched for missing loved ones at hospital morgues.\n\nThe lead singer of the Indonesian pop band Seventeen located the body of his dead wife after posting emotional posts on social media, vowing that he would not leave her. The group was performing at a beach hotel when the tsunami was captured on video smashing into their stage, killing several band members and crew.\n\nAnak Krakatau is a volcanic island that formed in the early part of the 20th century near the site of the cataclysmic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which killed more than 30,000 people and hurled so much ash that it turned day to night in the area and reduced global temperatures.\n\nThe head of Indonesia\u2019s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, said Saturday\u2019s tsunami was likely caused by Anak Krakatau\u2019s volcanic activity and so could not have been picked up by sensors, which monitor conventional earthquakes responsible for more than 90 percent of Indonesia\u2019s tsunamis.\n\nShe said the tsunami was probably caused by the collapse of a big section of the volcano\u2019s slope. Anak Krakatau has been erupting since June and did so again 24 minutes before the tsunami, according to the geophysics agency. Other scientists have said an underwater landslide may also have contributed to the disaster.\n\nGetty Editorial\n\nIndonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.\n\nIn September, thousands were believed killed by a quake and tsunami that hit Indonesia\u2019s Sulawesi island. A quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August.\n\nSaturday\u2019s disaster came ahead of the anniversary of the massive Asian tsunami that hit Dec. 26, 2004, after a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island spawned huge waves. The giant wall of water killed some 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Mexico Governor, Ex-Governor Killed In Christmas Eve Air Crash", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-helicopter-crash-claims-puebla-governor-ex-governor_us_5c21a568e4b05c88b6fb84f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:02:02", "body_paragraphs": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 A husband-and-wife political power couple who were the current and ex-governors of the central Mexican state of Puebla died in a Christmas Eve helicopter crash, officials announced.\n\nMexico\u2019s political class was stunned by the deaths of Gov.

It\u2019s the most produced, consumed and traded vegetable oil in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), perhaps making a palm oil-free life seem impossible, but its consumption should be on everyone\u2019s radar.\n\nBarcroft Media via Getty Images An illegal palm oil plantation is seen in Aceh, Indonesia, shortly after its creation in June.\n\nThe good news is that many, including the WWF and Greenpeace, believe that it\u2019s possible to produce palm oil responsibly, though all sides appear to admit that there\u2019s still a ways to go.\n\nOne way to help curb palm oil demand is for people to reduce consumption. This can be done by checking ingredient labels, though palm oil is often listed as something else. Another way is to avoid processed foods, because palm oil is often an ingredient in other ingredients. (As a bonus, whole foods are often healthier for you.)\n\nAnother way to help is to purchase products that use sustainably sourced palm oil, many of which are certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and feature its label. Though there are debates on the RSPO\u2019s strength, many argue that it\u2019s wiser to use sustainable palm oil instead of totally boycotting palm oil because the palms produce more oil and require less land to grow than other oils, like rapeseed, sunflower and soybean.\n\nHere is a list of products to help you stay more palm oil-conscious this year.\n\nAle-ks via Getty Images Palm oil helps give chocolate a smooth and shiny appearance.\n\nChocolate\n\nPalm oil helps give chocolate a smooth and shiny appearance and keeps it from melting, making it an extremely popular ingredient, especially in chocolates that have soft or gooey features.\n\nDivine Chocolate is one brand that is not only palm oil free but also takes extra strides to give back to the communities that help produce it.\n\nGhirardelli\u2019s solid chocolate is palm oil free.

Let\u2019s be realistic: probably not. A new you is a tall order! But by setting a few smart, specific New Year\u2019s resolutions, it\u2019s entirely possible to improve certain areas of your life.\n\n\u201cThe key is to not be too broad,\u201d said Amanda Stemen, the owner of FUNdaMENTALs, a psychotherapy and coaching group in Los Angeles. \u201cYour resolutions need to be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely.\u201d\n\nWith smart goal setting in mind, we asked our readers to tell us the New Year\u2019s resolutions they plan to make for 2019. Below, Stemen and other therapists and life coaches rate how achievable some of those goals are, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 the most achievable.\n\n1. I spend a lot of time on social media, especially Instagram. How do I cut back without dealing with FOMO?\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThe feasibility of this goal depends on the industry this person works in. Many of us have jobs or run businesses in which it\u2019s necessary to stay connected and active on these networks. In that case, pulling back requires some intention and careful goal planning, said Kate Stoddard, an associate marriage and family therapist at Wellspace SF in Northern California.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone who likes to post a lot outside of the job, ask yourself why you\u2019re posting and what you want from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who likes to scroll endlessly, try making your feed intentional by spending 10 whole seconds on each post and deciding if this is something you want to follow or not.\u201d\n\nIf your job allows, try taking a full social media break from the sites you find particularly addictive and see how you feel.\n\n\u201cFrom there, decide if social media is something that you want to continue using or not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to control how and why you use it, not the other way around.\u201d\n\n2. I\u2019ve been spending too much money on Postmates and other food delivery apps. Next year, I resolve to use those apps less and cook more.\n\nHow achievable it is: 4/5\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a financial strain to initiate some change in our lives, said Ryan Kelly, a psychologist in Charlotte, North Carolina. There are some tangible payouts for this goal, so it\u2019s likely to stick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the stress relief of saving some money and the pride of cooking healthy meals will increase the likelihood of success here,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure you set a specific goal \u2015 for instance, I used to order four times a week, this year I\u2019ll order two times a week \u2015 and plan for food preparation (e.g., shopping list for simple, appetizing meals).\u201d\n\neclipse_images via Getty Images Plan for your meal prep and you'll be less likely to order pricey takeout.\n\n3. I need to be more proactive about my dating life, but I loathe opening the dating apps on my phone. This year, I\u2019m going to be better about following through with matches.\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThis can be a tough one to stick to because it\u2019s so easy to get overwhelmed by the potential matches or feel hopeless that you\u2019re ever going to meet the right person, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who specializes in counseling men. Sometimes, it pays to give yourself a breather from the apps.\n\n\u201cA woman I\u2019m counseling has struggled with the results she\u2019s gotten from dating apps for the past year and has decided to back off and go more old school by trying to meet and get to know people in person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s being more intentional about going to her local market, where she\u2019s had pretty good success, and participating in activities like fun runs and Meetups.\u201d\n\n4. I want to invest more in the friendships that I already have and be a more thoughtful friend. How do I accomplish this without making myself feel like my to-do list is just getting longer?\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating this one. Keeping up with friends when you already have a frenzied schedule is going to take some effort and intention, said Alena Gerst, a psychotherapist in New York City. Plus, it requires effort from all parties.\n\n\u201cIt takes two to invest in a friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully your friend will be equally interested rejoining forces with you on being more present. If you try a couple of times and your effort is not reciprocated, it\u2019s time for a more heart-to-heart talk or to accept the friendship as is.\u201d\n\nTom Werner via Getty Images Quality time together takes two.\n\n5. In 2019, I would like to start eating more mindfully. Sometimes I eat not because I\u2019m actually hungry but because I\u2019m bored, stressed or in need of a break.\n\nHow achievable it is: 2/5\n\nMindful eating is a great goal, but first you\u2019ll have to dig a little deeper and figure out what\u2019s causing you to feel stressed or bored and to seek relief in the fridge, said May Bartlett, a life coach at Wellspace SF.\n\n\u201cFor the goal of mindful eating to be successful, it needs to be paired with a willingness to shift your relationship with your emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we eat out of boredom or stress, it\u2019s typically a way to escape the sensations that are associated with those emotions. In order to stop the habit of eating when we aren\u2019t hungry, the first step is to be mindful of the sensations we\u2019re trying to avoid and see what happens when we sit with them.\u201d\n\n6. My husband and I are used to mindlessly scrolling through our phones when hanging out. I want 2019 to be filled with more quality time, so I\u2019m resolving to not use my phone during dinner and ask my husband to do the same.\n\nHow achievable it is: 4/5\n\nIf this person\u2019s husband gets on board, this resolution should be a cinch, Kelly said. The difficulty is that smartphones are notoriously rewarding. \u201cOur phones provide a lot of pleasure through dopamine, stress relief by decreasing cortisol and are ingrained in our daily lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems like this person has the resolve, a clearly defined goal (no phones at dinner), and best of all, you have each other. Accountability goes a long way, especially for tough goals. Put your phones in a drawer before you eat (turned off) and hold each other responsible. Do it for each other, if not for yourselves.\u201d\n\n7. I want to bring more excitement into my life and make special memories with my family. Does this necessarily mean I need to spend more money on weekend activities?\n\nHow achievable it is: 5/5\n\n\u201cMoney = fun\u201d is a societal trap that\u2019s way too easy to fall into. You don\u2019t have to spend more money on activities in order for family time to be memorable, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThis goal is very doable with a little creative thought and effort. Think about how a child will sometimes have more fun playing with the box a birthday gift came in than the gift itself,\u201d he said. \u201cDo a search online for resources with lists of fun family activities. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to find that there are a lot of options where the cost can be kept really low.\u201d\n\nImages By Tang Ming Tung via Getty Images Fun doesn't have to set you back financially\n\n8. I want to start getting up earlier during the week so I start my day on a less hectic, anxiety-ridden note. Ideally, I\u2019d like to consistently have enough me time in the mornings to do things like exercise, journal or meditate.\n\nHow achievable it is: 2/5\n\nThis one might be hard to pull off because it doesn\u2019t include a game plan for how the person will pull off waking up earlier, Stemen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too broad,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what time they want to get up or when they\u2019ll go to bed. This goal will be more achievable when they set a time and activities they want to do and come up with a realistic plan to achieve it.\u201d\n\n9. I want to find a charity or organization to volunteer with in 2019. I try to contribute financially to different causes where I can, but I would like to be more giving when it comes to my time.\n\nGrade: 4/5\n\nCompared with some other resolutions, this goal is easy to achieve, Maryland-based psychologist Samantha Rodman said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This State Wanted To Expand Healthcare For The Poor.

Voters rejected the citizen initiative last month, 53 to 47 percent. Three other red states passed similar measures the same day.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nPerhaps the chief takeaway from the rejected citizen initiative to expand Medicaid in Montana last month is this: Be careful when you poke a giant.\n\nMontana was one of four red states with Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and the only one where it failed. And the reason why, many close observers both inside and outside of the state agree, almost certainly came down to a tactical decision to link expansion to an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax.\n\nSupporters thought that strategy would boost their effort with voters, but it attracted Big Tobacco into the fight, along with the $17.2 million it spent, much of it on a television advertising blitz. Opponents raised nearly $19 million to defeat the measure, finance reports filed with the state show.\n\nProponents, with about $9.7 million to spend, simply couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\n\u201cIt was impossible with the money we had to compete,\u201d said one of the leaders of the coalition, who spoke with Stateline but asked not to be named because the coalition has not yet publicly addressed what went wrong. The tobacco interests \u201cgot too far ahead with their messaging.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, this activist said, it may have been a mistake to combine Medicaid expansion and a tax that targeted a deep-pocketed opposition.\n\nThe tobacco industry went nowhere near the other states where Medicaid expanding initiatives appeared on November\u2019s ballot: Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Medicaid expansion plans passed comfortably in those states, but the Montana version fell decisively, 53 to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cThe basic lesson is that if you create a big political target, don\u2019t be surprised if people pay attention to it,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIf you propose to raise tobacco taxes, don\u2019t be surprised if tobacco pushes all its chips in. The same happens when you try to raise soda taxes.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is a government-supported health insurance for the poor, and each state has an option to expand that program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAdam Searing, an associate professor at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, noted that the only difference between Montana and the three other states was the inclusion of a specific tax in the Montana initiative. That inclusion diluted the central message of the ballot measure, he added.\n\n\u201cBasically it seems the more you focus on that central issue of expanding affordable health care to more working class people, the more successful you are likely to be,\u201d Searing said of the success in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that advocates in other non-expansion states might want to take to heart as they continue their fight \u2014 which they are vowing to do, despite the ruling earlier this month by a federal judge in Texas that the entire ACA, including the Medicaid expansion provision, is unconstitutional.\n\nMany legal analysts on both the left and the right say the decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in a lawsuit brought by Republican governors and attorneys general from 20 states is unlikely to stand. In any case, the ACA will remain in place while the ruling makes its way through the appellate courts, perhaps ending up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fairness Project, an advocacy group that reportedly spent $6 million in support of the initiatives in November, names Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming as states where Medicaid expansion initiatives could reach the ballot in 2020. Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the project, said the ruling in Texas hasn\u2019t dampened the group\u2019s conviction that most Americans support expansion.\n\nIn a tracking poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation the week after the midterm elections, 59 percent of voters in non-expansion states said they favored expansion.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid already had been expanded by law in 2016 to include any adult with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line. In 2018, that translates to $16,753 for an individual. Before the expansion, only Montana low-income adults who were caregivers, pregnant or disabled qualified for Medicaid.\n\nBut that 2016 expansion had been set to expire in July 2019. The ballot proposal last month, Initiative 185, would have made the Medicaid expansion permanent. (The other three states will see expansion for the first time.)\n\nNow it will be up to the Republican-controlled legislature to determine the future of the expansion in Montana, a high priority for popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C., have adopted Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nExpansion proponents in the Treasure State think their losing campaign this fall, which entailed a grassroots operation, will pay off with a legislative victory in the winter.\n\nThe pro-expansion campaign, said Jessica Rhoades, Bullock\u2019s health policy adviser, \u201ccreated a volunteer network of very motivated nurses and doctors who can go into the legislative session with a strong base of support behind them.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming Montana House speaker, said court ruling in Texas is worth paying attention to, but it won\u2019t halt work in Montana to craft a Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s financially sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re still forging ahead,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nThe legislative session begins Jan. 7, and lawmakers already are crafting bills in preparation for upcoming hearings, Hertz said. Republicans are interested in cost-control measures that could include performance audits and work requirements for single, able-bodied adults, he said.\n\nMontana Senate President Scott Sales, also a Republican, agreed that expansion proponents will still have the votes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d spoken to me a few days before the court ruling, I\u2019d say Medicaid expansion is going to pass in some form; I think that\u2019s still the case,\u201d Sales said.\n\nFinancial mismatch\n\nThe $19 million raised in opposition to the campaign, 91 percent of it from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, is more than twice the amount spent on Montana ballot measures since at least 2006, data compiled by FollowTheMoney showed. The nonprofit, which tracks campaign spending, found it was also more than $7 million above the amount spent by all candidates in the last Montana gubernatorial election, in 2016.\n\nSupporters of Initiative 185 raised $9.7 million, also more than previous Montana ballot measures. That coalition \u2014 Healthy Montana for I-185 \u2014 included groups representing hospitals and health care providers in the state as well as advocacy groups representing the poor, retired people and labor unions. It also included state chapters of national organizations that support efforts to end diseases, such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\n\nProponents say the financial mismatch doomed the initiative even as pre-election polls had shown voters evenly divided on the measure. Montana State University, for example, reported in late October that 41.4 percent of Montana voters were in favor of expansion versus 40.8 percent against, with a 2 point margin of error.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this article, Chuck Denowh, the spokesman for Montanans Against Tax Hikes \u2014 created for the Medicaid campaign \u2014 and president of the Montana Group, a Helena political and public relationship consulting firm, said he was on a family vacation and couldn\u2019t respond. He did not respond to a request to designate someone else with the organization. Altria did not respond by deadline to a request for an interview.\n\nOther factors besides big spending by tobacco may have contributed to the loss.\n\nThe ballot language began with a description of the tax increase, and that didn\u2019t help, said Jesse Cross-Call of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy and research think tank in Washington. \u201cUnless you were intimately aware of it before going into the voting booth, it was hard to know what was at stake. It looked like the initiative was about raising taxes rather than extending health care to more people.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s measure proposed a general sales tax increase and the initiatives in Idaho and Nebraska left it up to the legislature to decide how to pay for the expansion.\n\nBut, according to Rhoades, early polling suggested that linking a tobacco tax to expansion would improve its chances. That doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case.\n\nCoalition members pushed for the tobacco increase not only as a source of financing for the expansion, but also as a discouragement to smoking, which itself, Healthy Montana claimed, costs Montanans $440 million in health care every year.\n\nThe initiative would have increased the tobacco tax by $2 for a pack of 20 cigarettes. It also would have increased taxes on snuff and created a tax on vaping.\n\nFewer uninsured in Montana\n\nBy March of this year, Montana\u2019s Medicaid had extended benefits to 94,000 newly eligible beneficiaries, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. Bullock\u2019s office said expansion, along with other elements of the Affordable Care Act, reduced the uninsured rate in the state from 15 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent today.\n\nIn its economic analysis, the university report said expansion has injected $350 million to $400 million of new spending into the state each year. That money has generated about 5,000 new jobs and will produce about $270 million in personal income in each year between 2018 and 2020, the report found.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs, with its portion gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. That\u2019s compared with 65.5 percent for traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe proponents of Initiative 185 said the increased tobacco taxes, which they estimated would\u2019ve raised an additional $74 million a year by 2023, would pay for that extra 10 percent.\n\nThe university report estimated that after 2020, when the federal match drops to 90 percent, the increased state tax revenue from the economic activity generated by the expansion would be enough to cover the state\u2019s expansion costs without raising taxes or creating new ones.\n\nThat is the position Bullock has taken in urging the legislature to pass expansion next year. The governor\u2019s proposal does not call for an increase in tobacco taxes but would include a small increase in taxes on medical providers.\n\nBut that was not the message of the initiative\u2019s opponents, who ran ads claiming \u2014 falsely, proponents say \u2014 that the proposed tobacco increase would not cover expansion costs. All Montanans would end up footing the bill, their ads proclaimed.\n\nThe looming question, of course, is what will happen in the legislature. Some of those who led the campaign for expansion have told Stateline they are pessimistic, fearing legislators who are inclined to vote against can now point to the election results to justify a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nCasey Schreiner, the incoming House minority leader and supporter of expansion, said he wasn\u2019t overly worried.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the legislature sees the benefit of taking the sunset off,\u201d the Democrat told Stateline, referring to the July 2019 expiration of the current Medicaid expansion plan. \u201cEverybody understands what happened, that a large amount of money got dumped into Montana and the initiative was mischaracterized as a tax increase rather than expanding health care."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Doctor's Note Policies Punish Students For Being Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-doctors-note-policies-poverty_us_5c1bfc6fe4b05c88b6f66933", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:02:05", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s said that during the holidays, all roads lead home \u2015 or, for those who have access, to the doctor.\n\nThe holiday season is like being invited to a white elephant gift exchange only to find out that each beautifully wrapped box contains a different variation of stomach virus, cold, strep or the flu. Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:02:05", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Arms Sales to Saudis Leave American Fingerprints on Yemen\u2019s Carnage", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/world/middleeast/yemen-us-saudi-civilian-war.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-26 09:02:06", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cIn the end, we concluded that they were just not willing to listen,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state and an incoming member of Congress from New Jersey. \u201cThey were given specific coordinates of targets that should not be struck and they continued to strike them.

He has also been critical of people who have been less than forthright about their Vietnam records. Earlier this month, he chided Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, over misleading statements he made years ago about his own Vietnam record, calling him \u201cDa Nang Dick\u201d on Twitter.\n\nDr. Braunstein\u2019s daughters said that when he discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s medical exemption, he often mentioned Dr. Weinstein, though it was unclear to them what role Dr. Weinstein may have played.

Then a social worker came into his room and told his wife Dorothy, \u201cYou have to move him tomorrow to an L.T.A.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ms. Rosen recalled saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s an L.T.A.C.?\u201d\n\nQuestion: Was she demonstrating inadequate health literacy, or should the social worker have clarified that L.T.A.C.s \u2014 long-term acute care hospitals \u2014 provide more care than nursing homes for very ill patients?"}]
