Now, he's sitting in a Tokyo jail cell.\n\nThe dramatic downfall of the iconic global business leader is a tale of bombshell allegations, corporate intrigue and simmering cultural tensions.\n\nA 40-year auto industry veteran, Ghosn brought together three big carmakers \u2014 Renault ( RNSDF ) of France and Japan's Nissan ( NSANY ) and Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ) \u2014 with the aim of rivaling the top dogs: Volkswagen ( VLKAF ), Toyota ( TM ) and General Motors ( GM ).\n\nHis vision appeared to be working: Ghosn's alliance makes one out of every nine cars sold around the world. But its future has now been cast into doubt after he was arrested in Japan, ousted as chairman of Nissan and sidelined at Renault. Mitsubishi is expected to fire him on Monday.\n\nThe Brazilian-born executive is accused of taking advantage of his position at the top of Nissan, which he ran for more than 15 years. The allegations include concealing millions of dollars of personal income and using company assets for his own benefit.\n\nAs his reputation is trashed and the empire he built comes under strain, Ghosn is stuck in a Tokyo jail cell, facing the prospect of 10 years in prison if convicted. He's yet to respond publicly to the allegations.\n\nWhat has Ghosn allegedly done?\n\nGhosn was detained by Tokyo prosecutors on Monday when he reportedly stepped off a flight from Beirut, where he grew up. His arrest followed an internal investigation at Nissan that the company said found \"significant acts of misconduct\" over many years, including understating his income in financial reports and misusing company assets.\n\nA Nissan manufacturing plant in England, part of the global auto empire Ghosn oversaw.\n\nProsecutors allege that he and another Nissan director, Greg Kelly, collaborated to understate Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) over a five-year period ending in March 2015.\n\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK reported that Ghosn also failed to properly disclose homes that were provided for him by Nissan in four different countries. NHK added that prosecutors suspect Ghosn may have pocketed money that was meant for other Nissan executives.\n\nNissan, which hasn't confirmed the details reported by NHK and other Japanese news outlets, has accused Kelly of being the \"mastermind\" behind the scheme.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nGhosn was named Nissan CEO in 2001 and is credited with pulling off a stunning turnaround at the company, which was in financial trouble at the time.\n\nSince then, he has engineered deeper integration between Nissan and Renault. Mitsubishi joined the alliance in 2016 after Nissan bought a 34% stake in it. Together, the three companies employ more than 470,000 people in nearly 200 countries.\n\nBut the partnership is unequal. Nissan, which is much bigger and sells more vehicles than Renault, holds only a 15% non-voting stake in the French company. Renault holds a much more powerful 43% shareholding in Nissan.\n\n\"In pure monetary terms, Renault has been getting a better deal than Nissan,\" analysts at investment firm SC Capital wrote this week.\n\nSome analysts suggest that this has stirred discontent among Nissan executives, who were also uncomfortable about the possibility of Renault and Ghosn seeking for a full-blown merger.\n\nA number of analysts and commentators have suggested that Ghosn was the victim of a \"palace coup\" by Nissan executives nervous over how much power he had accumulated.\n\nAsked about the coup speculation, a Nissan spokesman said that the company \"believes strongly that the investigation revealed serious misconduct spanning multiple years\" and that the actions it took against Ghosn were \"fully necessary.\"\n\nWhat's next for Ghosn?\n\nJapanese prosecutors have yet to indict Ghosn, a French citizen who grew up in Lebanon, on any charges. He is being held at a detention center in Tokyo, where prisoners are typically fed basic meals three times a day and sleep on Japanese futons.\n\nProsecutors on Wednesday received permission to detain Ghosn for a further 10 days as they continue questioning him. He is being given access to his lawyer and to French consular services.\n\nHis long Nissan career is almost certainly over. Its board members unanimously voted on Thursday night to oust Ghosn as chairman following a lengthy meeting.\n\nEarlier this week, Renault stopped short of firing Ghosn as its chairman and CEO, instead appointing an interim replacement.\n\nWhat's the future of the alliance?\n\nBoth Nissan and Renault have said Ghosn's arrest won't affect the alliance . Officials from the French and Japanese governments have echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"The long-standing alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\" Nissan said Thursday after firing Ghosn, adding that it would try to \"minimize the potential impact and confusion.\"\n\nBut a great deal of uncertainty remains. Analysts say Ghosn was the force that held the three companies together.\n\nA nightmare scenario for Nissan could arise if prosecutors fail to bring a successful case against Ghosn and he returns as Renault chairman. The SC Capital analysts speculated that Ghosn could retaliate by trying to kick Nissan out of the alliance and seeking a tie-up with a bigger rival like GM instead.\n\nThat is probably unlikely, as the costs of the alliance failing would be huge. The companies estimate they save over 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) every year by sharing technology and other resources.\n\n\"If the entire alliance blows up badly ... that would be the worst strategic mistake made by an automaker in decades,\" said Travis Lundy, an analyst at investment research network Smartkarma."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US reportedly urges allies to block use of Huawei equipment", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/A2b73uJszzo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) The United States is urging its allies to stop using Huawei telecommunications equipment because the Chinese company poses a security threat, according to a published report.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal , citing sources familiar with the discussions, reports that US officials are pushing countries that host American military bases to ban the use of Huawei equipment from their wireless and internet networks.\n\nThe US military uses secure networks for its most sensitive communications, but it is concerned that much of its traffic still moves over commercial networks in countries such as Germany, Italy and Japan, the Journal reported.

In Malta, sexual offense legislation is framed in the context of \"crimes affecting the good order of families.\"\n\nAccording to a2016 European Commission Special Eurobarometer Report on Gender-based Violence, nearly a third of all respondents (27%) said there are situations in which sex without consent is justified, including if the person is drunk or on drugs (12%), has voluntarily gone home with someone (11%), has worn revealing clothes (10%), hasn't fought back or hasn't said \"no\" clearly (10%).\n\nAcross the continent, weak legislation, coupled with a \"dangerous culture of victim blaming,\" has detrimental effects for victims of sexual assault seeking to bring their cases forward, according to the group, which has called on governments across Europe to bring legislation into line with international human rights standards.\n\n\"Sex without consent is rape, full stop,\" Anna B\u0142u\u015b, Amnesty International's researcher on Western Europe and women's rights, said in a statement.\n\n\"Until governments bring their legislations in line with this simple fact, the perpetrators of rape will continue to get away with their crimes,\" B\u0142u\u015b said.\n\nIn the European Union alone, an estimated 9 million women over the age of 15 -- at least one in 20 women -- have been raped, according to 2014 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights data analyzed by Amnesty International.\n\nBut without legal provisions to ensure a fair trial, women often choose not to report rapes.\n\n\"Women's fear of not being believed is confirmed time and time again, as we see courageous survivors who do seek justice frequently failed by outdated and harmful definitions of rape in law and treated appallingly by justice officials,\" B\u0142u\u015b said.\n\nAlthough it is important for countries to include consent in their legal definition of rape, it is one of many steps they must take to protect victims of sexual violence in the legal sphere, according to Amnesty International and many women's rights campaigners.\n\nMany countries still struggle to secure convictions, even with consent-based rape legislation.\n\nIn the UK, an estimated one in seven women has reported experiencing some form of sexual violence, placing it in the joint top five countries for the most amount of sexual assaults recorded, according to the Amnesty review.\n\nBut despite this, the number of rape convictions dropped 23% in 2017-18, compared with the previous year, according to data from the UK's Crown Prosecution Service\n\n\"Despite the definitions of rape in the UK being compliant with international human rights standards, the Government has a duty to ensure access to justice for rape survivors is a reality,\" said Chiara Capraro, Amnesty International UK's women's human rights program manager, citing media reports alleging that UK prosecutors have been encouraged to \"ditch weak rape cases\" to improve their annual conviction figures.\n\nThe Guardian reported that the Crown Prosecution Service \"denied a change of approach, and said it had a duty to ensure fairness for both complainants and suspects.\"\n\nKatie Russell, a spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said that although she supports consent-based rape laws, they aren't enough.\n\n\"It needs to be accompanied by a wholesale understanding about what consent means,\" Russell said, stressing the importance of education about consent across public sectors.\n\n\"Whilst the definition is clear in our law, an understanding of that definition is completely lacking,\" she explained. \"It's lacking amongst jurors -- and that's the general public who make up juries and ultimately decide the outcome of cases. But the suggestion is that it's also missing amongst criminal justice agents themselves.

In March, two former Northern Ireland rugby players were acquitted of raping a 19-year-old student at a house party in Belfast. After the trial, demonstrators protested the treatment of the woman on trial with the phrase #IBelieveHer, arguing that the defense had followed a line of inappropriate and irrelevant questioningto discredit her.\n\nAt a criminal court in Cork, Ireland, in October, the defense lawyer for a 27-year-old man accused of raping a 17-year-old asked the jurors to consider the teen's underwear as evidence of implied consent.\n\n\"Does the evidence out-rule the possibility that she was attracted to the defendant and was open to meeting someone and being with someone? You have to look at the way she was dressed. She was wearing a thong with a lace front,\" the lawyer said, according to the Irish Examiner\n\nThe case prompted demonstrations across Ireland and an international social media campaign in which women posted pictures of their underwear with the hashtag #ThisIsNotConsent.\n\nNoeline Blackwell, a human rights lawyer and chief executive of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, said that those trials point to a deep-rooted societal perception that the victim is partially responsible in their rape.\n\nBlackwell agrees that consent-based laws are a crucial step in implementing wider reforms.\n\n\"It is great that at least our legal definitions are in line, but until it is properly implemented -- requiring effort and training of police, the court system and lawyers -- then we are not going to get the proper impact of the law,\" Blackwell said.\n\nJurgita Pe\u010di\u016brien\u0117, a gender-based violence expert at the European Institute for Gender Equality, said that public sentiment stresses the importance of educating the public not only on what consent means but also about the role that gender inequality plays in gender-based violence.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"In order to have effective laws and coordinated policies based on evidence, it needs to start at education,\" Pe\u010di\u016brien\u0117 said.\n\n\"Our actions must not focus only on prosecution but on the prevention of violence in general against women, the prevention of rape and also combating the root cause of gender inequality,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that women often don't report rape or sexual assault because of shame, lack of support by fear of not being believed, being blamed or even experiencing more violence.

The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report's findings run counter to President Donald Trump's consistent message that climate change is a hoax.\n\nBut the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; it's demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history . Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWithout significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says.\n\nThe expense\n\nThe costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield.\n\nHeat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010.\n\nRed tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals.Red tides,or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent.\n\nImpacts on our health\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\n\nWest Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. There will be more mosquito- and tickborne diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures.\n\nExpect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change\n\nParticularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death. No one's health is immune from climate change, the report concludes. People will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases.Particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death.\n\nHeat and flooding\n\nWildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than before -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050.\n\nDependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures.\n\nAlong the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges.\n\nEnergy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said.\n\nThe number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days.\n\nSea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater.\n\nBy midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, \"possibly significantly.\"\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\n\nBut the The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security.But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy.\n\nA report from the UN in October urged all governments to take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTime for action\n\nReactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community.\n\n\"If we're going to run this country like a business, it's time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost,\" said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University.\n\n\"In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon.\"\n\nScientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Scientists want to dim the sun", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/Vh-333qhojg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe research by scientists at Harvard and Yale universities, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters , proposes using a technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection, which they say could cut the rate of global warming in half.\n\nThe technique would involve spraying large amounts of sulfate particles into the Earth's lower stratosphere at altitudes as high as 12 miles.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health, and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise.\n\nTrump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government's inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. In September, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 lives , with more likely to come in its aftermath. Last month, Hurricane Michael claimed at least 32 lives , with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing . The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.\n\nAs the Earth warms due to the continued burning of coal, oil, and gas, climate-related disasters that include high-intensity hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, forest fires, and heat waves, pose rising dangers to life and property. Hurricanes become more destructive as warmer ocean waters feed more energy to the storms. Warmer air also carries more moisture for devastating rainfalls, while rising sea levels lead to more flooding.\n\nYet Trump and his minions are the loyal servants of the fossil-fuel industry, which fill Republican party campaign coffers. Trump has also stalled the fight against climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. The politicians thereby deprive the people of their lives and property out of profound cynicism, greed, and willful scientific ignorance.\n\nThe first job of government is to protect the public. Real protection requires climate action on several fronts: educating the public about the growing dire risks of human-induced climate change; enacting legislation and regulations to ensure that families and businesses are kept out of harm's way, for example by stopping construction in flood plains, and investing in sustainable infrastructure to counteract rising sea levels; anticipating the rising frequency of high-intensity climate-related disasters through science-based preparedness following through on properly scaled disaster-response during and after storm events; and most importantly for the future, spearheading the rapid transition to zero-carbon energy to prevent much greater calamities in the years ahead.\n\nThis straightforward to-do list is the opposite of what Trump and his cronies are doing. Trump blithely disregards scientific findings about climate change and thereby exposes the nation to unprecedented risks. The officials he has appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant parts of government are industry cronies and lobbyists far more interested in self-enrichment, padding their accounts, and helping their once-and-future employers than in doing their current jobs.\n\nTrump's mishandling of last year's Puerto Rico disaster in the wake of Hurricane Maria is grounds itself for impeachment and trial. Thousands of citizens died unnecessarily on Trump's watch because the administration could not be stirred to proper action before, during, and after the hurricane.\n\nTwo independent, detailed epidemiological studies, using different methodologies -- one led by researchers at Harvard University and the other by researchers at George Washington University -- have estimated that thousands died in the aftermath of Maria.\n\nWhile dozens died during the storm, thousands more died as a result of the residual effects of the storm. Maria downed electricity and wreaked havoc on the ability of Puerto Ricans to meet their life-sustaining needs by disrupting access to health services, safe water, and transportation. They died, in short, from the storm, and ultimately from inadequate disaster prevention, preparedness and response.\n\nYet when the George Washington University study was released in September, the President responded by saying , \"I think we did a fantastic job\" in Puerto Rico. He brazenly denied the death count , without any attempt whatsoever to understand or learn from the findings.\n\nRecent scientific studies underscore the dire emergency ahead. Professor James Hansen, one of the world's leading climatologists, has demonstrated that the Earth's climate has moved above the temperature range that supported the entire 10,000 years of civilization. The risks of catastrophic sea level rise are upon us.\n\nA group of world-leading ecologists recently highlighted that critical Earth systems could spiral out of control. The Nobel-prize winning Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has also just released a harrowing report showing that the world has just a few years left to move decisively towards renewable energy if it hopes to achieve the globally agreed target to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature of the planet.\n\nFor more opinion...

The closely watched dispute, which both sides believe is headed for the Supreme Court, would affect racial admissions nationwide and how easy -- or hard -- it is for students of all backgrounds to obtain a place on prestigious campuses.\n\nAt Harvard, the percentage of Asian-American students admitted has been steadily increasing, and for the most recently admitted class of 2022 reached about 23%. African-Americans were at about 15% and Latino at 12%. A category of mainly white students accounts for 50%.\n\nHere's what to watch in upcoming months:\n\nWhat's next\n\nAfter a three-week trial in Boston that ended on November 2, the parties' respective versions of the salient facts and legal justifications are due December 19. Two groups representing African-American, Hispanic, Native American and Asian-American students siding with Harvard have until January 9 to make their last claims, as do other \"friend of the court\" groups.\n\nBurroughs has set February 13 for final arguments. She is under no specific deadline for her eventual ruling.\n\nThe Department of Justice has filed a \"statement of interest\" on the side of Students for Fair Admissions, noting that the Trump administration is investigating Harvard's screening processes after a complaint to the Department of Education from more than 60 Asian-American groups.\n\nKey arguments\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions asserts four specific claims under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination at schools that receive federal funds: that Harvard holds Asian-Americans to a higher standard than other applicants; that Harvard engages in unlawful racial balancing to keep roughly the same percentage of racial groups; that it uses race not as a lawful \"plus factor\" but as a defining factor in choosing some students; and that it has bypassed race-neutral options for diversity, such as students' socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n\"The law is clear,\" Students for Fair Admissions lawyer John Hughes said during closing arguments. \"Evidence of bias and stereotyping can suffice to show intentional discrimination. This is particularly true in a system like Harvard's that is not race-neutral.\"\n\nAs Harvard has denied all claims, the university asserts that the challengers are trying to \"turn back the clock\" and reverse court-sanctioned racial admissions policies that bring diversity to campus.\n\n\"What the evidence has demonstrated is that Harvard has worked over the years tirelessly to create a vibrant educational environment that includes students from all walks of life,\" Harvard's lead trial lawyer, William Lee, said in closing arguments. \"We do not admit simply GPAs and board scores. We admit people.\"\n\nOn appeal\n\nAfter Burroughs rules, the losing party could appeal to the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the US Supreme Court. That process would take several months. A related affirmative-action challenge filed by Students for Fair Admissions is pending against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Those proceedings are at an earlier stage and no trial has yet been held.\n\nBoth cases were engineered by conservative activist Edward Blum, who for years had sought white plaintiffs to challenge affirmative action. Blum has said he ultimately wants reversal of the 1978 Supreme Court milestone that first allowed universities to consider students' races among many factors but forbade admissions quotas. The Supreme Court has upheld Regents of the University of California v. Bakke over the years, but by only a single vote.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court last reviewed race-based admissions in higher education, in 2016, Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the decisive vote to endorse a University of Texas at Austin program that considered applicants' races, among other characteristics. That case had been brought by Abigail Fisher, a white student enlisted by Blum for the lawsuit after she was rejected for admission to the Texas flagship university.\n\nKennedy, who retired in July, has been succeeded by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose record as a lower court judge shows him to be more conservative than Kennedy.\n\nThe student perspective\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions did not call any Asian-American students to the stand during the three-week trial. Two groups of Harvard students backing the Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had sought to be part of the case, and Burroughs allowed them limited testimony in opening and closing arguments.\n\nRepresented by leading civil rights groups, they emphasized that racial affirmative action makes a difference for all students.\n\n\"The outcome impacts ... the educational environment students will encounter,\" said Genevieve Bonadies Torres, of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, during closing arguments. \"Diversity is what is at stake in this case.\"\n\nAdded Cara McClellan, of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, \"During this divisive time for our country, the need for citizen leaders, educated in diverse settings, remains as urgent as ever. ... Race remains a visible marker that cannot be ignored.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Roger Stone associate says he is in plea negotiations with Mueller's office", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/tZKal8av6jQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi said Friday he is in plea negotiations with special counsel Robert Mueller's office.\n\nCorsi, confirming an earlier Washington Post report , declined to comment further.

The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report's findings run counter to President Donald Trump's consistent message that climate change is a hoax.\n\nBut the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; it's demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history . Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWithout significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says.\n\nThe expense\n\nThe costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield.\n\nHeat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010.\n\nRed tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals.Red tides,or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent.\n\nImpacts on our health\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\n\nWest Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. There will be more mosquito- and tickborne diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya.West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures.\n\nExpect asthma and allergies to be worse due to climate change\n\nParticularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death. No one's health is immune from climate change, the report concludes. People will be exposed to more foodborne and waterborne diseases.Particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures in the summer, children, the elderly, the poor and communities of color will be at a much greater risk for illness and death.\n\nHeat and flooding\n\nWildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than before -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050.\n\nDependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures.\n\nAlong the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges.\n\nEnergy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said.\n\nThe number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days.\n\nSea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater.\n\nBy midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, \"possibly significantly.\"\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\n\nBut the The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security.But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy.\n\nA report from the UN in October urged all governments to take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTime for action\n\nReactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community.\n\n\"If we're going to run this country like a business, it's time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost,\" said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University.\n\n\"In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon.\"\n\nScientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Dimming the sun: The answer to global warming?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Vh-333qhojg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe research by scientists at Harvard and Yale universities, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters , proposes using a technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection, which they say could cut the rate of global warming in half.\n\nThe technique would involve spraying large amounts of sulfate particles into the Earth's lower stratosphere at altitudes as high as 12 miles.

A CEPIAD's program is the only one of its kind in Senegal, and West Africa,offering clean needles and opioid substitutes. A 2017 report showed that out of 37 nations in Africa reporting drug use data to the United Nations, just eight offer this type of therapy to addicts.\n\n\"Most users are coming here because it's the only center really,\" says Mbodj, who is 58. He began snorting heroin after traveling to Paris in his early twenties to study for a degree in technology.\n\nBy the age of 27 he was jailed for dealing cocaine and deported home after serving a three-year sentence.\n\n\"My family put a lot of hopes on me. When I started using they were extremely disappointed. There was a lot of deception,\" he recalls. On returning home to Dakar he would steal things at home to sell and buy heroin.\n\nThe entrance of CEPIAD based within the grounds of Fann hospital in downtown Dakar.\n\nA local market for opiates\n\nOver 10% of injecting users in the country are living with HIV, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates, compared with less than one percent of the general population.\n\nThe country has seen a spike in opiates trafficked on their way to Europe creating an uncommon local market over the last decade according to the UNODC.\n\n\"Often what the traffickers are doing is they are paying their support staff not only in cash but in drugs,\" Pierre Lapaque, UNODC representative for West and Central Africa, told CNN.\n\n\"It's a very smart approach because you are creating a market in a region where there was absolutely no market ten years ago and it was just a transit area.\"\n\nA voluntary survey carried out by the French National Agency for Research against AIDS unearthed more than 1,300 injecting addicts in Dakar in 2011. Previously there were no official statistics on how many people in the country were injecting drugs. A 2010 study of six states in Nigeria provided the only data for West Africa as a region.\n\nProduce grown in the garden by patients goes to the center's canteen.\n\n'Harm reduction' through free needles\n\nSenegal's government reacted with a \"harm reduction\" program when the survey was released. Back then 18,614 free needles and 17,564 condoms were handed out to addicts over a two-year period.\n\nBy December 2014, the government opened CEPIAD, offering methadone, condoms and clean needles with money from its AIDS prevention budget and training from UNODC and various international partners, including from the US and France.\n\n\"When I came in 2015,\" says Mbodj, \"it allowed me to slow my life down a little bit and have time for myself to think about things.\"\n\nLater that year and with money from the country's National AIDS Council -- CLNS -- Mbodj was able to launch a community group for addicts, Sant\u00e9 Espoir Vie (SEV), which translates as \"health, hope, life.\"\n\nThe nonprofit operates independently of CEPIAD but a few members, including Mbodj, are paid mediators recruiting new patients for the clinic.\n\nThese mediators network the city's high drug-use areas every day to connect with addicts. There are 12 mediators that go out in teams of two.\n\n\"When we go into these drug hotspots people are very comfortable with us because we used to be users. We know how to approach them,\" says Mbodj.\n\nNurse Mamadou Ka cares for a new patient who is in observation in CEPIAD.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help'\n\n\"If they miss a treatment we go to their homes. This is the social component of our jobs. We have to sit down and talk to them and re-convince them.

They assume without it they'd still be using, in prison perhaps, or worse.\n\n\"For me at least it saved my life,\" says one woman, 33, who didn't want to be identified because she fears for her safety.\n\nShe would burn through 100,000 West African CFA francs ($175) worth of cocaine a day, funded through prostitution.\n\nA musician friend introduced her to crack cocaine at a club when she was 20. At first he bought the drugs.\n\n\"Then he lost his job so he said 'I have some friends on the street who could help you out' and that's when I became a sex worker,\" she recounts.\n\nA former addict is nearly two years into recovery from cocaine.\n\nBy the age of 22 she was selling herself on the streets. In 2013, she was jailed for 15 days for begging in public.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help. All I was thinking about was just getting money and smoking.\"\n\nShe was at risk because of the unprotected sex and the violence that came with a drug-fueled lifestyle.\n\n\"At night sometimes thugs would follow us and steal our money, they would threaten us with knives and call us druggies,\" she says.\n\nIn 2015, she became very ill. When her sister took her to the hospital she was referred to CEPIAD for treatment and was diagnosed as HIV positive. Initially when she started treatment with counseling and drug substitution she relapsed and would still use cocaine.\n\n\"I made an agreement with the doctor that if I get married I am going to completely stop,\" she says. \"I've been married one year and eight months. I met someone here at the center. He is on methadone treatment but he's sober.\"\n\nFormer addict Esther B\u00e2, 50, takes her daily dose of methadone. She first tried heroin at the age of 18.\n\nQuitting without a substitute drug, users say, is incredibly difficult.\n\nMauama, who prefers we don't use her last name because of the stigma her family would face, knows this first-hand.\n\nShe sought exile from heroin and cocaine addiction in Touba, a holy city in the Muslim nation some 200 kilometers from Dakar.\n\n\"I went there because they have no dealers, no drugs, it's completely conservative,\" she says. \"I took [opioid painkiller] Tramadol as a substitute to stop cravings but I'd last two months and go back to Dakar, get the drugs and go back up.\"\n\nHer routine of abstinence and relapse lasted seven years. Then she met outreach workers from CEPIAD who offered her an alternative.\n\n\"I have been coming every day for two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nComprehensive treatment\n\nAt CEPIAD, psychologists and doctors provide counseling, HIV services, skills workshops and help with reintegrating into family networks.\n\nPeer support workers who are themselves former drug users also offer help along the journey to a drug-free life.\n\n\"All of those things are a good part of a comprehensive approach to treatment,\" says Robin Clark, a professor in the Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health and Quantitative Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. He focuses on substance abuse and primary care.\n\nAs well as arts therapy, counseling is available to get addicts back into work.\n\nIt is crucial for such clinics to move beyond medication, he says of the use of methadone.\n\n\"There are a lot of psychosocial support just around daily living that really good effective centers try to offer to help people re-enter normal life after they have been unemployed, many people have been in prison,\" says Clark.\n\nApart from Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius are among the only eight countries in Africa offering 'harm reduction' approaches due to lack of funding and preference for faith-based and traditional healers.\n\n\"There are still challenges,\" admits Mbayang Fall Bousso, CEPIAD's health coordinator, who calls herself the organization's temple guardian.\n\n\"It's still only in Dakar and inside a hospital so not many people know it exists.\"\n\nThose making the daily commute face logistical challenges and she wants the clinic to run nationally.\n\n\"This way we can be able to reach out to those who are still not able or willing to come,\" says Bousso. \"To reduce the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, TB and of course to reduce the amount of users.\"\n\nSince CEPIAD opened, more than 700 addicts have sought reprieve here. Now, outreach teams are targeting M'bour, about 80 kilometers south of Dakar.\n\n\"It's a beach town. It's a very touristy town too with a lot of cocaine and heroin. Consequently a lot of users,\" says Mbodj. \"Every day I meet people that I think can be helped.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving: Watch out for these illnesses tied to recalled foods", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/i0SRD3w4u3Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is many Americans' favorite holiday because it is a time when family, friends, neighbors and strangers come together to share their favorite foods.

One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople have become sick in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has identified an additional 18 people who have become sick with the same strain of E. coli in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which also is investigating the outbreak, cautions that if you have any romaine lettuce at home, you should throw it away, even if you have eaten some and did not get sick.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted Thursday that the agency continues to investigate the source of the outbreak. \"We believe it's related to lettuce harvested from California. We hope to have more information by Monday isolating the growing region.\"\n\nGottlieb said the key is to get the current stock off the market and restock with new produce. Romaine lettuce will be harvested soon in Florida, Arizona and other regions.\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce. Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nTurkey products\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak. The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Romaine' calm: Funny and meaningful memes to 'lettuce' get through this recall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/zR3r1PvT6wg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Spinach.

It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked\n\nThis report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.\n\nAnd, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.\n\nWith warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.\n\nThe White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.\n\nSpokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was \"largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population\".\n\nThe world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.\n\nWhat does the report say?\n\nThe US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.\n\n\"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,\" the report says.\n\n\"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.\"\n\nThe report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.\n\nBut it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \"to adapt to the changes that will occur\".\n\nWhat reaction has there been?\n\nEnvironmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.\n\nBrenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not \"some problem in the distant future\".\n\n\"It's happening right now in every part of the country,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September\n\nThat view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.\n\n\"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,\" she said.\n\nFormer US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season.\n\n\"Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,\" Mr Gore said.\n\n\"The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.\"\n\nWhat does President Trump say about climate change?\n\nIn October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a \"political agenda\", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.\n\nAfter taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAt the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.\n\nDuring his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was \"a hoax\". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: \"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.\"\n\nHow great is the climate threat?\n\nA report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.\n\nThat means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.\n\nIf the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Donald Tusk tells European Union to approve deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46330380", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:30", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/getty\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday.\n\nIt comes after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit.\n\nHe said he had received the written guarantees he needed over Spain's role in the future of the British territory.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Brussels to hold talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit.\n\nMeanwhile, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become a \"satellite state\" under the deal.\n\nThe UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU.\n\nEven if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition.\n\nSpain had raised last-minute objections ahead of the summit about how the issue of Gibraltar had been handled in the Brexit talks so far.\n\nBut EU leaders secured a compromise with the Spanish prime minister, who said that Europe and the UK \"had accepted the conditions set down by Spain\" and so would \"vote in favour of Brexit\".\n\nMr Tusk, who represents EU leaders on the world stage, said he recommended \"that we approve on Sunday the outcome of the Brexit negotiations\" in a letter to members of the European Council.\n\nHe added: \"No-one has reasons to be happy.

We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics.\n\n\"We have to make sure services are available for them.\"\n\nIt comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a \"vast gap\" in NHS mental health support.\n\nAnne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children.\n\nShe said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas.\n\nNearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide.

Indeed, they could even be using social media for support.\n\nAdolescence is key\n\nThe majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders.\n\nThese are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time.\n\nUniversity College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: \"Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.\n\n\"Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people.\"\n\nHow many children get help?\n\nThe NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.\n\nThat is fewer than 3% of the population.\n\nThe figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away.\n\nThis could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams.\n\nBut Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them.\n\nHer report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months.\n\nWhat needs to happen?\n\nThe commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around \u00a3700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support.\n\nBy comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population.\n\nThe commissioner said an extra \u00a31.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line.\n\nShe said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example.\n\nEmma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children.\n\nShe said the charity gets \"calls every day\" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help.\n\n\"This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need.\"\n\nShe agreed early intervention and better funding were essential.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nBoth NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority.\n\nIn fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access.\n\nLast month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least \u00a32bn of the extra \u00a320bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health.\n\nA new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years.\n\nNational mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of \"ramping up\" access to services.\n\nShe said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment.\n\n\"Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing.\"\n\nMinisters have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online.\n\nOne option being considered is a new regulator for the internet."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Family size shrinks to record low of 1.89 children", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46303120", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright shapecharge Image caption More women are having just one child\n\nThe number of children women are having is continuing to decline, to a record low of 1.89, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIts study compared two groups of women: those born in 1972, who are now in their 40s, with those born in 1945, who had an average of 2.19 children.\n\nThe numbers of families in England and Wales with just one child grew from 14% to 18%.\n\nChildlessness also increased in women, from 10% to 18%.\n\nWhat's driving the decrease?\n\nPamela Cobb, an ONS statistician, said: \"Women are delaying childbearing, from their 20s to their 30s.\n\n\"This might be due to participating in higher education, partnering or marrying later, or waiting until they are financially secure.\n\n\"This could lead to fewer children, partly because there is less time.\n\n\"For some, there is also an element here of a lifestyle decision.\"\n\nAnother factor is the continuing decline in teenage pregnancy.\n\nIn the 1945 group, 17% of women had at least one child by the age of 20.\n\nBy 1972, this had come down to 13%.\n\nFertility rates are also rising for women aged between 40 and 45, although the numbers overall remain small."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report warns of growing impact on US life", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46325168", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nUnchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns.\n\n\"Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,\" the 4th National Climate Assessment says.\n\nThe report says climate change is \"presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth\".\n\nThe warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.\n\nSounding an alarm\n\nBy James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News\n\nDuring a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, \"whatever happened to global warming?\"\n\nNow, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail.\n\nGlobal warming is here in the US, they say -

This transition occurred in concert with the development of stone tools, which would have allowed our ancestors to butcher the carcasses of animals; either as scavengers or hunters.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption Artwork: The extinct giraffe Sivatherium maurusium vanishes from the fossil record around 700,000 years ago\n\nTo investigate whether humans played a role, the researchers compiled a seven-million-year record of herbivore extinctions in eastern Africa. They focused on the very largest species, the so-called \"megaherbivores\" which weigh more than 2,000lbs (907kg).\n\nToday, only elephants, hippos, giraffes and white and black rhinos fall into this category.\n\nBut the three-million-year-old human relative \"Lucy\" (Australopithecus afarensis) shared her East African habitat with three species of giraffe, two species of rhino, a hippo and four elephant-like species.\n\nAustralia extinction 'due to man'\n\nHuman link to giant turtle's end\n\nThe results of the analysis showed that over the last seven million years, some 28 lineages of large mammal went extinct in Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the onset of the herbivore decline began roughly 4.6 million years ago, and the rate of decline did not change following the appearance of Homo erectus, one of the earliest human ancestors that could have contributed to the extinctions.\n\n\"This extinction process kicks in over a million years before the very earliest evidence for human ancestors making tools or butchering animal carcasses and well before the appearance of any hominin species realistically capable of hunting them, like Homo erectus,\" said Dr Faith.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption The fossilised jawbone of a sabre-toothed cat from South Africa. The disappearance of massive herbivores may also have affected the carnivores that fed on them\n\nThe researchers also examined records of climatic and environmental trends. They conclude that the climate is a much more likely culprit than humans. Climate change seems to have been behind the replacement of large shrubs and trees by grasslands.\n\n\"The key factor in the Plio-Pleistocene megaherbivore decline seems to be the expansion of grasslands, which is likely related to a global drop in atmospheric CO\u2082 over the last five million years,\" said co-author John Rowan, from University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n\"Low CO\u2082 levels favour tropical grasses over trees, and as a consequence savannas became less woody and more open through time. We know that many of the extinct megaherbivores fed on woody vegetation, so they seem to disappear alongside their food source.\"\n\nThe loss of big mammals in Africa could also explain other extinctions that have been blamed on our ancient ancestors.\n\nFor example, some scientists have suggested that increasingly carnivorous early human groups led to a decline in predators and scavengers.\n\n\"We know there are also major extinctions among African carnivores at this time and that some of them, like saber-tooth cats, may have specialised on very large prey, perhaps juvenile elephants,\" said co-author Prof Paul Koch from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC).\n\n\"It could be that some of these carnivores disappeared with their megaherbivore prey.\"\n\nWriting in the same issue of Science, Ren\u00e9 Bobe and Susana Carvalho from the University of Oxford raised a few words of caution over the conclusions: \"It is not clear what ecological roles hominins played throughout the long evolutionary history of megaherbivores in Africa, and how these roles changed over time and varied across geographic space.\n\n\"Another question is when hominins became systematic predators of animals larger than themselves.\"\n\nThey added: \"The causes of megaherbivore decline are probably complex, multidimensional, and varied across time and space. The precise timing of key hominin behavioural innovations remains poorly constrained by the current archaeological and palaeontological records.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Could Winning The House And 7 Governorships Spell The End Of The Democratic Party?", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/could-winning-the-house-and-7-governorships-spell-the-e-1830621155", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Local\n\nWoman Toys With Idea Of Getting Sister Something Nice They Can Do Together As Gift Before Settling On Candle"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "How To Make The Most Of Black Friday Shopping", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-black-friday-shopping-1830620094", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

As the severity escalates, governors are finding they have to make disaster planning a priority or risk the consequences of inaction defining their terms and enraging voters.\n\nHandling disasters and emergencies was a prime topic last week when the National Governors Association held a three-day seminar in Colorado that most of the nation\u2019s 19 governors-elect attended.\n\n\u201cAs California\u2019s wildfires, a spate of hurricanes, and unfortunate acts of mass violence have demonstrated, such events can occur at any time,\u201d Scott Pattison, the nonpartisan association\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement, \u201cincluding a governor\u2019s first day in office.\u201d\n\nFor many Democratic governors especially, the main concern is how climate change appears to be worsening the effects of natural disasters.\n\nIn California, half of the 10 most destructive wildfires in state history have occurred since 2017, and the costliest have been in each of the past three years, according to the state firefighting agency. The state has spent $500 million from its emergency firefighting fund just since July 1, putting this wildfire season on pace to be among the costliest yet.\n\nThe state is dealing with its most destructive wildfire ever, a Northern California blaze that leveled a town of 27,000 this month, killed at least 80 people and left thousands homeless. That blaze, and another that roared through Malibu at the same time and left at least three dead, are the latest in a string of catastrophic wildfires that have put the state in what seems like a perpetual state of emergency.\n\nOutgoing Gov. Jerry Brown has called California\u2019s mega fires \u201cthe new abnormal\u201d as climate change turns the state warmer and drier.\n\nThe escalating destruction prompted state lawmakers to pass a series of wildfire-related bills this year. Among other provisions, they provide millions of dollars to cut trees and brush, make it easier for property owners to clear their land and require the state\u2019s utilities to step up their fire-prevention efforts.\n\nDuring his campaign, incoming Gov. Gavin Newsom said wildfire planning would be a priority for his administration and outlined a number of steps he wants to take. Among them is a more aggressive approach to clearing trees and brush, particularly the state\u2019s millions of dead trees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see our National Guard working on those kinds of emergencies than being on the border,\u201d Newsom told the nonprofit news organization CALmatters over the summer.\n\nHe also proposed deploying a network of infrared cameras to detect wildfires early, improving the emergency alert system and boosting funding for fire departments throughout the state.\n\nA spokesman, Nathan Click, said Newsom is putting together a comprehensive wildfire strategy as he prepares to take office in early January. But the governor-elect also has been clear that the long-term goal must be reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fire season has been especially severe, yet other Western states also have experienced ever-intensifying wildland blazes in recent years.\n\nIn Colorado, the two most destructive wildfires in state history erupted within the last six years, killed a total of four people and destroyed more than 850 homes combined. Both are believed to be caused by humans, leading Democrat Jared Polis, Colorado\u2019s governor-elect, to call for a public education campaign to reduce the possibility of manmade wildfires.\n\nHe also said the state should invest in programs to remove flammable debris and help communities and private landowners take steps to prevent the spread of wildfires.\n\nNearly 1 million people in Colorado live in areas considered to have at least some risk of a devastating fire.\n\nFlorida has been hit with two deadly and destructive hurricanes in roughly a year\u2019s time. Hurricanes Irma last year and Michael in October caused tens of billions of dollars in damage.\n\nEven without hurricanes, many coastal communities are dealing with flooding from high tides and storm surges. Incoming Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has already said he will work with local governments to address rising sea levels, but has been criticized by Democrats for avoiding any mention of climate change in his environmental plan.\n\nDeSantis has said he is neither a climate change \u201cdenier\u201d nor a \u201cbeliever.\u201d That could be a problem for identifying long-term solutions to keep coastal communities safe, said Jen Hensley, the director of state lobbying and advocacy at the Sierra Club.\n\nShe said one reason Hurricane Michael was so devastating was a lack of strong statewide coastal development standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to change zoning rules in coastal areas,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cThe reality is that those areas are more flood prone than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s similar in Texas, which has seen widespread destruction from hurricanes and where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been noncommittal about whether he thinks human activity is affecting the climate.\n\nTexas has sought $12 billion from the federal government for a 60-mile coastal \u201cspine\u201d of concrete seawalls, floating gates and steel levees as a defense against future hurricanes and higher tides expected from climate change. That\u2019s just a fraction of the work the state estimates need to be done over the next decade to reduce the impact of flooding.\n\nIn 2017, Hurricane Harvey left Houston underwater, killed dozens and left an estimated $125 billion in damage. Abbott named a recovery czar after the storm and wants to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the Texas coast, but attention on the issue has faded.\n\nGovernors in New York and New Jersey pushed for changes after Superstorm Sandy devastated the region in 2012.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed a law requiring sea level rise projections to be used whenever the state considers approvals or funding for projects. Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pushed policies to buy homes in some flood-prone areas, although environmentalists criticized him for not addressing climate change.\n\nThose groups cheered last year when Democrat Phil Murphy was elected to replace Christie, but they have been critical of him too since, saying he\u2019s not taking action to address global warming.\n\nEarlier this month, Murphy experienced the perils of falling short on the basics of emergency preparedness when an early season snowstorm hit without plows at the ready, bringing roads and the transit system to a standstill and stranding thousands of commuters.\n\nHe was hit with waves of criticism, and his transportation commissioner was forced to apologize.\n\nMurphy said it was too simplistic to say his administration \u201cdropped the ball.\u201d But he added, \u201cThe buck stops with me, period.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "AP Interview: Saudi Royal Says Crown Prince is Here to Stay", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ap-interview-saudi-royal-says-crown-prince-is-here-to-stay/4672211.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "A prominent Saudi royal said Saturday that whether or not heads of state gathered in Argentina next week for the Group of 20 summit warmly engage with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he is someone \u201cthat they have to deal with.\u201d\n\nPrince Turki al-Faisal told The Associated Press the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul last month is \u201can unacceptable incident that tars and mars the long record of Saudi Arabia\u2019s own standing in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will have to bear that. It\u2019s not something that should not be faced. And we do face it,\u201d he said.\n\nIntelligence officials and analysts say the operation to kill Khashoggi, who wrote critically of the crown prince for The Washington Post, could not have happened without Prince Mohammed\u2019s knowledge. The kingdom, which has offered several conflicting accounts of the killing, denies the crown prince had any involvement.\n\nThe crown prince embarked late Thursday on his first foreign tour since the Oct. 2 killing with a visit to the United Arab Emirates. He\u2019s expected to visit other Mideast countries before going to Buenos Aires Nov. 30 for the start of the two-day G-20 summit, where he\u2019ll come face to face with world leaders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has kept international pressure mounting on the kingdom, are among those expected to attend.\n\n\u201cWhether the leaders in that summit will warmly engage with the crown prince or not, I think all of them recognize that the kingdom as a country and King Salman and the crown prince are people that they have to deal with,\u201d the prince said.\n\nHe said Saudi Arabia will continue to play a role on the world stage and that Trump\u2019s statement of support for Saudi Arabia recognizes the importance of the kingdom.\n\nTrump insists there\u2019s not enough evidence to blame the crown prince for Khashoggi\u2019s killing, despite a U.S. intelligence report\u2019s assessment to the contrary. Trump says the kingdom is an important ally that has helped to lower oil prices.\n\n\u201cI thought President Trump was expressing what he felt was in the interest of the United States. He emphasized the strategic relationship between the two countries in the same statement and how Saudi Arabia has been helpful in many instances \u2014 not just oil,\u201d said Prince Turki.\n\nThe prince also firmly dismissed the U.S. intelligence assessments that the crown prince had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing, saying these same intelligence bodies had a \u201cremarkably flawed assessment\u201d in 2003 in the lead up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t take it as being, as I said, divine revelation,\u201d he said of the U.S. intelligence reports.\n\nPrince Turki, who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the U.S. and Britain, worked closely for years with Khashoggi before the writer became an outspoken government critic. The prince said Khashoggi worked under him as a spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in London and later in Washington, and that he last spoke to him three years ago.\n\nThe prince\u2019s father is the late King Faisal and his brother is Prince Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca.\n\nPrince Turki said that reports of discontent within the ruling Al Saud family over the crown prince\u2019s rapid rise to power do not reflect the \u201cextraordinary support\u201d that King Salman and his son, the crown prince, enjoy.\n\n\u201cI see no signs of such disquiet or uncertainty vis-a-vi the king and the crown prince,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prince spoke Saturday during a policy briefing by the Beirut Institute Summit . The summit is the brainchild of Arab writer and columnist Raghida Dergham. The prince is a board member and supporter of the summit, which draws upon recommendations of its participants to put forth policy ideas for the Middle East.\n\nAmong its recommendations is support for the Arab Peace Initiative, a Saudi initiative dating back to the early 2000s that calls for east Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in exchange for Arab state recognition of Israel and normalized relations.\n\nIn the absence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis, Gulf Arab states have moved ahead with their own outreach to Israel .\n\nThe driving force appears to be shared concern over Iran\u2019s expansion in the region. Oman, which has often played the role of regional mediator, welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a surprise visit last month.\n\nPrince Turki, who himself appeared on a panel last year alongside a former chief for Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, said such appearances do not represent a normalizing of relations with Israel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much a rapprochement as, how can I put it, a shot by shot deal that rises as happened with the effort by the Sultan of Oman to push for a restart of the negotiations,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Ranchers Combat Overgrazing to Fight Climate Change", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ranchers-combat-overgrazing-to-fight-climate-change/4670713.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Meredith Ellis gets a bit rapturous about the little patch of earth under her feet.\n\nWhen she bought this northern Texas land several years ago, it was overgrazed and overrun with weeds. Now, she\u2019s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb. She picks a tiny patch of the green moss from between clumps of tall brown grass gone dormant with the fall chill.\n\n\u201cLook at all these little bits of biodiversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a little fantasy world going on in there.\u201d\n\nBringing it back has been a labor of love \u2014 love of the G Bar C Ranch where she grew up, and for the 4-year-old son she\u2019s raising here.\n\n\u201cEverything I do, I think about him now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about his future, and what is this world going to look like when he\u2019s my age?\u201d\n\nEllis worries about the droughts, floods and other calamities he may face from climate change. She wonders if there even will be enough food to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why she raises her cattle a bit differently than most.\n\nThe differences not only help to combat climate change. They also provide more clean water. They can even save ranchers money. And if one project goes forward, farmers may get financial rewards for making the changes.\n\nMeadows vs. lawns\n\nEllis\u2019s fields look like meadows. Her cattle forage among an assortment of thigh-high native grasses.\n\nOther ranches nearby look like giant lawns. Cows have grazed the grass monocultures nearly down to the ground.\n\nThe difference matters, says rangeland scientist Jeff Goodwin with the Noble Research Institute, because the native grass is \u201cnot only feeding this cow herd. It\u2019s also feeding the underground herd: the microbes, the biology in the soil. That\u2019s what really makes that soil an active, living, breathing system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a system with the potential to remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe more forage production that we\u2019re getting, the deeper the root systems, the more carbon we\u2019re sequestering out of the atmosphere,\u201d Goodwin added.\n\nThat\u2019s increasingly important. Scientists warn that the world needs to do more than just stop producing greenhouse gases in order to avoid the worst of climate change. Carbon dioxide needs to be actively removed from the atmosphere in order to keep the planet from potentially catastrophic warming.\n\nWhile engineers puzzle over high-tech solutions, a recent report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says nature offers tools that are ready to go today.\n\nValuable ecosystem services\n\nGrasslands and the soils beneath them act as giant carbon sinks, the report notes.\n\nBut not if they are overgrazed.\n\nAround the world, one estimate says, about 200 million hectares are overgrazed, an area roughly the size of Mexico.\n\nOne study estimates that optimizing grazing could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 89 million metric tons, roughly the same as permanently parking 19 million cars.\n\nPlus, overgrazed land erodes more easily. That\u2019s a double whammy. Ranchers lose fertile soil, and it ends up muddying drinking water downstream, which increases the cost to make it tap-ready.\n\nOn the other hand, healthy grassland soils that store carbon also store and filter water.\n\nThose benefits should be worth money, Goodwin said. They\u2019re known as ecosystem services, and the Noble Research Institute is working to develop a marketplace for them. Ranchers would earn credits based on their soil\u2019s carbon content and its water storage and filtration capacity.\n\nSome major food and beverage companies are interested in the market. Many have set goals to improve sustainability up and down their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really a solid path forward\u201d for many of them to meet those goals, Goodwin said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re sitting in a very good position to be able to provide that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAll profits from the soil\n\nMany of the steps ranchers could take to earn ecosystem service credits would help their bottom lines anyway.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to talk about soil health building as a thing to do for the environment. But really, it\u2019s something we need to be doing for our profitability as well,\u201d said Michael Vance, managing partner at Stark Ranch, a short drive from Ellis\u2019 operation.\n\n\u201cAll your profit comes from the soil,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stood in a field where cattle had recently been grazing, but you\u2019d never know it. The grass still stood tall. His neighbors don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t let the cows graze it all the way down. They think he\u2019s wasting it.\n\n\u201cWe get phone calls where people want to drive a bailer in here and bail up this grass, but they don\u2019t realize the positives that come by leaving it standing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe field grows more grass when cattle are moved off it sooner. That means Vance buys less feed.\n\nEven if it\u2019s more profitable, it\u2019s not easy for people to change their ways, and ranchers are a conservative bunch.\n\n\u201cYou realize things that you were raised doing, things that your dad and your granddad did, maybe weren\u2019t the best things to do,\u201d Vance said, \u201cfrom an environmental perspective, maybe from even a profitability perspective.\u201d\n\nFinancial incentives might help other ranchers make changes, he adds.\n\nThe Noble Research Institute plans to launch a pilot ecosystem services market in 2019 and is aiming for a full rollout in 2022."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Fires, Floods and Other Disasters Await New Governors", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/fires-floods-and-other-disasters-await-new-governors/4672319.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Governors have a wide range of priorities they want to tackle in the coming year, from tax reform to education.

Roy Cooper can stop it.\n\nThe GOP-dominated General Assembly returns to work Tuesday to decide how a new amendment to the state constitution requiring photo ID to vote in person will be carried out. The amendment passed with more than 55 percent of the vote, giving Republicans confidence to move ahead despite years of controversy in the state over such a mandate.\n\nMeeting now is strategic. Democrats won enough legislative seats Election Day to end the Republicans\u2019 veto-proof control come January. So Cooper, a longtime opponent of voter photo ID laws, won\u2019t be able to stop any lame-duck session bills as long as Republicans remain united.\n\nNew restrictions, on which courts probably will weigh in, would affect over 7 million voters in the anticipated 2020 presidential battleground state, which will also feature races for governor and U.S. Senate that year.\n\n\u201cWe will pass a law that improves the real and perceived integrity of the election system,\u201d said Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican expected to shepherd a bill through the legislature.\n\nRepublicans have passed voter ID legislation twice, but they\u2019ve been derailed both times. Federal judges struck down a wide-ranging 2013 elections law, which contained several voting restrictions, writing it was passed with \u201cracially discriminatory intent\u201d by targeting black residents with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nUndeterred and rejecting the ruling as political hyperbole, GOP lawmakers decided to submit the voter ID question directly to voters. More than 30 other states require some form of identification to vote. Along with a successful November referendum in Arkansas, four states now have constitutional provisions addressing photo ID.\n\nThe state chapter of the NAACP, which sued over the 2013 law, tried unsuccessfully to get judges to keep the referendum off the ballot and is still asking them to cancel the referendum results.\n\nThe state NAACP \u201chas led the fight against the anti-democracy, racist photo voter ID even before it was improperly placed on the ballot this time, and we will continue to fight it and any effort to suppress the sacred right to vote,\u201d said the Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, the state chapter president.\n\nVoter ID backers say it bolsters the public\u2019s confidence in elections \u2014 even as statistics show voter impersonation charges are extremely rare. Republicans cite stories from constituents who say they have seen fraud as credible proof.\n\nThe 2013 requirement was used for the state\u2019s two 2016 primaries before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the law. The U.S. Supreme Court let that decision stand.\n\nThe upcoming proposal is likely to expand on the 2013 ID provisions. Draft legislation released by Republicans this week envisions additional methods to qualify.\n\nIn addition to eight forms of approved IDs in 2013 \u2014 driver\u2019s licenses, military and tribal IDs among them \u2014 there would, for the first time, be free voter photo identification cards issued by county election boards, the draft says. Student IDs at University of North Carolina system schools \u2014 left out of the 2013 law \u2014 would work as well. And more qualifying IDs are possible.\n\nPeople with hardships to obtain IDs could get them for free or still vote without one if they signed a \u201creasonable impediment\u201d form. The constitutional amendment allows for exceptions.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the 1,050 people who filled out the form during the March 2016 primary had their ballot count, according to the state elections board. But Democracy North Carolina, a voting rights group, calculated more than 1,400 people who lacked acceptable photo ID didn\u2019t have their ballots counted, with black residents disproportionately affected. More than 2.3 million people voted in that election.\n\nDemocracy North Carolina Executive Director Tomas Lopez, whose group opposed the amendment, said the draft wouldn\u2019t resolve all concerns that it would create voting barriers for otherwise eligible voters. He said lawmakers shouldn\u2019t rush through a law this year.\n\nActivists also hope exceptions will be broadened by telling legislators the stories of people like Janice Franklin of Charlotte, a disabled woman who says her vote didn\u2019t count in the 2016 primary despite showing a Social Security card at the polls and filling out forms.\n\n\u201cWe need other options and at the same time we need these options to matter. They need to be in the law because people ... will know \u2018you bring this and it\u2019s going to count,\u2019\u201d Franklin, 60, said in a phone interview this week. The former preschool teacher now has a state ID card that qualified under the 2013 law.\n\nLewis said he wants input from critics to improve any measure.\n\nSen. Floyd McKissick, a Durham County Democrat who voted against the 2013 law, is skeptical Republicans will incorporate Democrats\u2019 suggestions. GOP leaders haven\u2019t wanted to include Democrats in hammering out other key legislation, he said.\n\nDespite strong opposition to the voter ID amendment in urban counties, a majority of the state\u2019s voters were in favor of requiring photo ID.\n\n\u201cIt has to be done,\u201d McKissick said. \u201cWe\u2019re beyond the point of saying whether it is something that can be enacted.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Says Time for Action on 'the Wall,' Visits Golf Course", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-time-for-action-on-the-wall-visits-golf-course/4670976.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump has returned to his West Palm Beach golf course on another sunny Florida day.\n\nTrump began his Friday on Twitter, saying Democrats and Republicans \"MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall.\"\n\nHe says it's \"time for action,\" even though the idea is opposed by many Democrats, who recently won control of the House.\n\n\n\nTrump also calls on Congress to pass criminal justice reform legislation.

Now, she\u2019s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb. She picks a tiny patch of the green moss from between clumps of tall brown grass gone dormant with the fall chill.\n\n\u201cLook at all these little bits of biodiversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a little fantasy world going on in there.\u201d\n\nBringing it back has been a labor of love \u2014 love of the G Bar C Ranch where she grew up, and for the 4-year-old son she\u2019s raising here.\n\n\u201cEverything I do, I think about him now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about his future, and what is this world going to look like when he\u2019s my age?\u201d\n\nEllis worries about the droughts, floods and other calamities he may face from climate change. She wonders if there even will be enough food to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why she raises her cattle a bit differently than most.\n\nThe differences not only help to combat climate change. They also provide more clean water. They can even save ranchers money. And if one project goes forward, farmers may get financial rewards for making the changes.\n\nMeadows vs. lawns\n\nEllis\u2019s fields look like meadows. Her cattle forage among an assortment of thigh-high native grasses.\n\nOther ranches nearby look like giant lawns. Cows have grazed the grass monocultures nearly down to the ground.\n\nThe difference matters, says rangeland scientist Jeff Goodwin with the Noble Research Institute, because the native grass is \u201cnot only feeding this cow herd. It\u2019s also feeding the underground herd: the microbes, the biology in the soil. That\u2019s what really makes that soil an active, living, breathing system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a system with the potential to remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe more forage production that we\u2019re getting, the deeper the root systems, the more carbon we\u2019re sequestering out of the atmosphere,\u201d Goodwin added.\n\nThat\u2019s increasingly important. Scientists warn that the world needs to do more than just stop producing greenhouse gases in order to avoid the worst of climate change. Carbon dioxide needs to be actively removed from the atmosphere in order to keep the planet from potentially catastrophic warming.\n\nWhile engineers puzzle over high-tech solutions, a recent report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says nature offers tools that are ready to go today.\n\nValuable ecosystem services\n\nGrasslands and the soils beneath them act as giant carbon sinks, the report notes.\n\nBut not if they are overgrazed.\n\nAround the world, one estimate says, about 200 million hectares are overgrazed, an area roughly the size of Mexico.\n\nOne study estimates that optimizing grazing could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 89 million metric tons, roughly the same as permanently parking 19 million cars.\n\nPlus, overgrazed land erodes more easily. That\u2019s a double whammy. Ranchers lose fertile soil, and it ends up muddying drinking water downstream, which increases the cost to make it tap-ready.\n\nOn the other hand, healthy grassland soils that store carbon also store and filter water.\n\nThose benefits should be worth money, Goodwin said. They\u2019re known as ecosystem services, and the Noble Research Institute is working to develop a marketplace for them. Ranchers would earn credits based on their soil\u2019s carbon content and its water storage and filtration capacity.\n\nSome major food and beverage companies are interested in the market. Many have set goals to improve sustainability up and down their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really a solid path forward\u201d for many of them to meet those goals, Goodwin said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re sitting in a very good position to be able to provide that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAll profits from the soil\n\nMany of the steps ranchers could take to earn ecosystem service credits would help their bottom lines anyway.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to talk about soil health building as a thing to do for the environment. But really, it\u2019s something we need to be doing for our profitability as well,\u201d said Michael Vance, managing partner at Stark Ranch, a short drive from Ellis\u2019 operation.\n\n\u201cAll your profit comes from the soil,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stood in a field where cattle had recently been grazing, but you\u2019d never know it. The grass still stood tall. His neighbors don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t let the cows graze it all the way down. They think he\u2019s wasting it.\n\n\u201cWe get phone calls where people want to drive a bailer in here and bail up this grass, but they don\u2019t realize the positives that come by leaving it standing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe field grows more grass when cattle are moved off it sooner. That means Vance buys less feed.\n\nEven if it\u2019s more profitable, it\u2019s not easy for people to change their ways, and ranchers are a conservative bunch.\n\n\u201cYou realize things that you were raised doing, things that your dad and your granddad did, maybe weren\u2019t the best things to do,\u201d Vance said, \u201cfrom an environmental perspective, maybe from even a profitability perspective.\u201d\n\nFinancial incentives might help other ranchers make changes, he adds.\n\nThe Noble Research Institute plans to launch a pilot ecosystem services market in 2019 and is aiming for a full rollout in 2022."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Developed in Australia Shows Promise", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis-developed-in-australia/4672104.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis using immunotherapy.

They called his decision a serious blow to girls\u2019 rights. Legal experts said the judge made clear that U.S. states have authority to ban the practice, though only about half do.\n\nHere is a look at the ruling, which dismissed several charges against a doctor accused of cutting nine girls in three states as part of a religious custom, and what could happen next.\n\nThe ruling, simplified\n\nDr. Jumana Nagarwala was among eight people charged in federal court in Michigan in connection with the genital mutilation of nine girls from Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois between 2015 and 2017. Authorities alleged that mothers brought their girls to Nagarwala when they were roughly 7 years old for the procedure.\n\nNagarwala has denied any crime was committed and said she performed a religious custom on girls from her Muslim sect, the India-based Dawoodi Bohra.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman threw out mutilation and conspiracy charges against all the defendants. He ruled that a 1996 federal law that bans female genital mutilation was unconstitutional because Congress didn\u2019t have the power to regulate the behavior in the first place.\n\nHeidi Kitrosser, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, explained that Congress doesn\u2019t have unlimited authority to legislate and can only make laws that fall within powers explicitly outlined in the Constitution.\n\nIn this case, Friedman found that Congress lacked authority to regulate the practice under the Commerce Clause because the procedure is not a commercial activity. He also said Congress\u2019 treaty powers don\u2019t give it authority, because there was no rational relationship between treaty obligations that call for equal rights and a law banning genital mutilation.\n\nBut the judge clearly stated that the power to regulate female genital mutilation lies with state governments, which have primary authority in defining and enforcing criminal law.\n\n\u201cThe court really could not have been clearer in suggesting this is something that states can do,\u2019\u2019 Kitrosser said.\n\nHuman rights fears\n\nThe AHA Foundation works to protect women from genital mutilation, honor violence and forced marriages. The group said the ruling was outrageous and set a precedent that cutting girls\u2019 genitals was not a concern at the national level.\n\nWhile 27 states have laws against female genital mutilation, including Minnesota and Illinois, the 23 states that don\u2019t could become destinations for the procedure, said Amanda Parker, the foundation\u2019s senior director. Michigan lawmakers banned the procedure after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly how we got here. The defendants in this case had the victims shipped from Minnesota to Michigan, and the only way of holding them accountable for FGM was the federal statute,\u201d Parker said in a statement. She said the court ruling \u201csends the message that the authorities are not serious about protecting girls, especially those in immigrant communities, from this form of abuse.\u201d\n\nFriedman said in his ruling that states without laws specifically banning female genital mutilation can still prosecute the practice under laws that criminalize sexual battery and abuse.\n\n\u201cNo state offers refuge to those who harm children,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut those abuse laws often don\u2019t take the specific issues surrounding female genital mutilation into account, said George Zarubin, AHA\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cThis is such an underground, secretive, barbaric practice,\u2019\u2019 Zarubin said. \u201cI think the judge made a major mistake.\u201d\n\nIs this common?\n\nGenital mutilation, also known as female circumcision or cutting, has been condemned by the United Nations. The World Health Organization says there is no health benefit to the procedure, and it can cause numerous health problems. The practice is common in parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East and is generally performed as a way of controlling a girl\u2019s sexuality.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to gauge how often genital cutting occurs in the U.S. because the practice is largely underground. A 2012 study from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more than 513,000 girls in the U.S. had been subjected to or were at risk of undergoing genital cutting.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nFederal prosecutors have the option of appealing Friedman\u2019s ruling, but it\u2019s unclear if they will. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has not returned messages from The Associated Press this week seeking comment.\n\nMolly Blythe, an attorney for Nagarwala, said Friedman\u2019s decision was warranted under the law and it is \u201cexactly what our justice system is designed to do.\u201d\n\nAlthough the bulk of the case is now dismissed, Nagarwala and three others still face federal obstruction charges, and Nagarwala faces an additional count of conspiracy to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.\n\nBlythe said Nagarwala will continue to fight the remaining charges.\n\nIf Friedman\u2019s decision stands, the AHA Foundation will work with Congress to try to pass a new federal law to ban the procedure nationwide, Zarubin said. The foundation will also continue work to ban the practice in all 50 states.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of us in the community that are working to try to ban female genital mutilation in this country are beside ourselves\u201d with this decision, he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "13 US Agencies Involved in Climate Change Report", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agencies-involved-in-climate-change-report/4672029.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "The federal government released on Friday a report that stated the impacts of climate change \u2014 from wildfires to increasingly destructive weather events, such as hurricanes, heat waves and droughts \u2014 are already affecting the United States, and the danger of more of these natural catastrophes is worsening.\n\nThe report said the related losses from climate change, including lower labor productivity and deaths because of extreme heat and weather events, would amount to the hundreds of billions of dollars by 2090.\n\nThe U.S. Global Change Research Program, made up of 13 federal departments and agencies, produced the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which was put together with the help of more than 300 experts, guided by a 60-member Federal Advisory Committee.

Joshi, an anthropology professor at Delhi University who has studied the islands. \u201cHe invited that aggression.\u201d\n\nJoshi noted that the visit not only risked Chau\u2019s life, but also the lives of islanders who have little resistance to many diseases.\n\n\u201cThey are not immune to anything. A simple thing like flu can kill them,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his first day Chau interacted with some tribesmen - who survive by hunting, fishing and collecting wild plants - until they became angry and shot an arrow at him. The 26-year-old self-styled adventurer and Christian missionary then swam back to the fishermen\u2019s boat waiting at a safe distance.\n\nThat night, he wrote about his visit and left his notes with the fishermen. He returned to North Sentinel the next day, Nov. 16.\n\nWhat happened then isn\u2019t known, but on the morning of the following day, the fishermen watched from the boat as tribesmen dragged Chau\u2019s body along the beach and buried his remains.\n\nPathak said seven people have been arrested for helping Chau, including five fishermen, a friend of Chau\u2019s and a local tourist guide.\n\nChau was apparently shot and killed by arrows, but the cause of death can\u2019t be confirmed until his body is recovered, Pathak said.\n\nHe also said the police were examining whether Chau had tried earlier to visit the isolated island.\n\nPathak said Chau and his accomplices planned well for last week\u2019s visit by \u201ccamouflaging the visit as fishing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chau appeared to be full of confidence as he wrote in his notes, \u201cGod sheltered him from coastguard and Navy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an Instagram post, his family said it was mourning him as a \u201cbeloved son, brother, uncle and best friend to us.\u201d The family also said it forgave his killers and called for the release of those who assisted him in his quest to reach the island.\n\n\u201cHe ventured out on his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,\u201d the family said.\n\nAuthorities say Chau arrived in the area on Oct. 16 and stayed on another island while he prepared to travel to North Sentinel. It was not his first time in the region: he had visited the Andaman islands in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWith help from a friend, Chau hired fishermen for $325 to take him there on a boat, Pathak said.\n\nAfter the fishermen realized Chau had been killed, they left for Port Blair, the capital of the island chain, where they broke the news to Chau\u2019s friend, who in turn notified his family, Pathak said.\n\nPolice surveyed the island by air Tuesday, and a team of police and forest department officials used a coast guard boat to travel there Wednesday. Another trip was planned Thursday.\n\nIndia has a hands-off approach to the island\u2019s people. Tribespeople killed two Indian fishermen in 2006 when their boat broke loose and drifted onto the shore, but Indian media reports say officials did not investigate or prosecute anyone in the deaths.\n\nIndia recently changed some of its rules on visiting isolated regions in the Andamans. While special permits are required, scholars say visits are now theoretically allowed in some parts of the Andamans where they used to be entirely forbidden, including North Sentinel. Chau had no permit, police said.\n\nChau had wanted ever since high school to go to North Sentinel to share Christianity with the indigenous people, said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Covenant Journey, a program that takes college students on tours of Israel to affirm their Christian faith. Chau went through that program in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go there for just adventure. I have no question it was to bring the gospel of Jesus to them,\u201d Staver said.\n\nStaver said Chau\u2019s last notes to his family on Nov. 16 told them that they might think he was crazy but that he felt it was worth it and asked that they not be angry if he was killed.\n\nBefore attending Oral Roberts University, Chau had lived in southwestern Washington state and went to Vancouver Christian High School. Phone messages left with relatives were not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "South Korea Shuts Down Massive Dog Farm, Will Convert Site Into Public Park", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dog-meat-farm-south-korea_us_5bf7912ae4b03b230fa0461f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "JUNG YEON-JE via Getty Images In this picture taken Nov. 28, 2017, a dog looks out from a cage at a dog farm during a rescue event, involving the closure of the farm organized by the Humane Society International (HSI) in Namyangju on the outskirts of Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea has shut down the country\u2019s largest dog meat factory, a move animal rights activists hope could signal the end of a practice that sees about a million of the animals slaughtered every year.\n\nGovernment officials began dismantling a massive slaughterhouse complex in Seongnam city, a suburb of Seoul, on Thursday that was large enough to hold hundreds of dogs at a time.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has already gotten the boot. And White House insiders have reportedly predicted there may be as many as five more Cabinet officials who go \u2014 whether by Trump\u2019s firing or their resignations \u2014 in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cA lot of administrations make changes after the midterms,\u201d Trump recently said. He\u2019s right. Most administrations undergo personnel changes after an election. But the Trump White House has been a revolving door from the start \u2014 a reflection of both the president\u2019s mercurial temperament and the type of people drawn to him.\n\nAs NPR noted in March, in little more than a year in office, Trump had already set a record for the most Cabinet replacements by a first-term president in the past 100 years. If the post-midterm shakeups proceed as predicted, it would amount to what Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook described as \u201cthe highest turnover rate in recent history.\u201d And that\u2019s talking about only the Cabinet. Among the top-level staff at the Trump White House, the pace of departures and replacements has also been record setting.\n\nNone of this should be surprising from a man who rose to fame in part by yelling \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d although it\u2019s hardly reassuring about the level of normality inside the West Wing. Yet as the number of Republicans willing to work for this president continues to dwindle, the deeper cause for concern is in how those in the thinning ranks \u2014 in the White House and in the party more broadly \u2014 demonstrate their acceptability to Trump. Rather than touting their record of leadership or mastery of policy, those vying for his favor instead are auditioning for the president by signaling their unquestioning loyalty and their penchant for Trumpian outrageousness.\n\nIn the absence of any coherent political philosophy from Trump, that\u2019s a recipe for even more rampant toadyism around a president who has shown disturbingly authoritarian impulses. Given his legal troubles, it\u2019s also likely to yield increased obstruction and deeper corruption in the White House. In Congress, a smaller but more loyalist Republican minority has shown no signs of reversing the party\u2019s total capitulation to Trumpism.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the acting attorney general after the firing of Sessions has made this situation obvious. Whitaker won the spot (which Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be treating as temporary) by voicing his opposition to the Mueller investigation in a series of public statements. Trump, who seems incapable of playing his cards close to his chest, nearly admitted as much in an interview with the conservative Daily Caller.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general is a troubling indication of the direction the Trump presidency is headed.\n\nOf course, flouting the Constitution and suggesting that Trump stands above the law isn\u2019t the only way to attract the president\u2019s attention. Adopting his conspiratorial thinking and anti-democratic tendencies also endears politicians to the president. Florida\u2019s Attorney General Pam Bondi has seized on the state\u2019s election recounts to make her case to Trump. She blasted Florida law enforcement officials for not investigating alleged voting irregularities in the state, despite no evidence of voter fraud \u2014 a move plainly designed to impress Trump by repeating his farfetched fantasies at the expense of American democracy. She is now rumored to be his choice for his next secretary of homeland security if he pushes out Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nHe also cottons to those who share his pugilistic style of politics. The worst example of that has been Trump\u2019s praise for Greg Gianforte, the Republican congressman from Montana who won his special election last year just one day after he physically assaulted a reporter. Campaigning there this October, Trump hailed Gianforte as a \u201ctough cookie.\u201d \u201cAny guy that can do a body slam, he\u2019s my kind of guy,\u201d Trump enthused before a cheering crowd in Missoula.\n\nBut nothing seems to delight Trump more than flattery, not only because his insatiable ego depends on it but also because he intuitively understands that those who mindlessly praise him have already decided they will side with him no matter what he does. For Trump, the sycophants are his first line of defense.\n\nFor the sycophants, Trump\u2019s endorsement can be what pushes them over the goal line. That was the calculation made by Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s new governor-elect. In the Republican primary, DeSantis at first faced a double-digit deficit against Adam Putnam, a respected politician from a prominent Florida family. Needing a miracle, DeSantis went straight to Trump, courting him with a heavy dose of puffery during a ride aboard Air Force One. After Trump tweeted his endorsement, DeSantis cruised to a 20-point victory in the primary.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s help, DeSantis was able to win without ever bothering to develop any clear policy positions \u2014 not a requirement for Trump voters. The Tampa Bay Times reported shortly after the primary that DeSantis had canceled an interview with Florida reporters because he was still figuring out his platform for the general election. He never got around to that. Instead, he spent his time making regular appearances on Fox News and filming a creepy television ad that showed him indoctrinating his children into Trumpism. DeSantis won a close election to Democrat Andrew Gillum, and it remains unclear what the incoming governor stands for beyond a blind allegiance to Trump.\n\nWhether angling for a position in his administration or simply courting his favor, such examples underscore Trump\u2019s corrosive influence on American politics. In choosing combative style over substance, embracing conspiratorial fury over rational discourse and pledging fealty to the president rather than the Constitution, Trump\u2019s troops are reinforcing Trumpism at the very moment the Republicans ought to be re-evaluating its effectiveness. The mixed results for the candidates he endorsed in 2018 surely give reason for some of them to reconsider.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 big midterm gains also should humble the president. But throughout his personal life, his business dealings and now his presidency, he has shown he cannot be chastened. He can only be provoked."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "The Most Profound \u2019Shower Thoughts\u2019 On Reddit This Week", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reddit-shower-thoughts-november-2018-last-part_us_5bf92d03e4b0771fb6b8f45b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Reddit has an entire \u201cShower Thoughts\u201d subreddit dedicated to \u201cthe miniature epiphanies you have that highlight the oddities within the familiar.\u201d In honor of those weird, wonderful and sometimes profound musings, here are some of the best posts from the last week:"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Obama Photographer Rips Donald Trump: Does \u2018Too Many Things\u2019 That Are \u2018Not Normal\u2019", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pete-souza-obama-photographer-donald-trump-lies_us_5bf9048ce4b0eb6d930e8f60", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Former White House photographer Pete Souza has not been afraid of throwing shade at President Donald Trump in recent years \u2015 and on Friday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead,\u201d he explained it was because Trump does \u201ctoo many things\u201d that are \u201cnot normal.\u201d\n\nSouza, who regularly trolls Trump by sharing snaps he took during his time covering former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to Instagram, told host Jake Tapper it was because he didn\u2019t want people to \u201cforget the first 500 days of the Trump administration\u201d and \u201call the craziness that happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also trying to correct some of his lies and falsehoods with photographic proof,\u201d he added, while talking about his new Trump-bashing photo book Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents.\n\nSouza, who was also a photographer for former Republican President Ronald Reagan, said he would not have treated failed GOP presidential candidates John McCain or Mitt Romney in the same way, had they become president.\n\n\u201cBecause they respected the office of the presidency and that\u2019s what we don\u2019t see from this president,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too many things that is not normal for a president to be doing.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip here:\n\n\"I don't want people to forget the first 500 days of the Trump administration, which is what this represents ...

It\u2019s the fourth time in recent months the administration has sought to bypass lower courts that have blocked some of its more controversial proposals and push the high court, with a conservative majority, to weigh in quickly on a divisive issue.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration asked the high court to fast-track cases on the president\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young immigrants from deportation. Administration officials also recently asked the high court to intervene to stop a trial in a climate change lawsuit and in a lawsuit over the administration\u2019s decision to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, is involved in three of the cases. Trump\u2019s recent salvo against the \u201cObama judge\u201d who ruled against his asylum policy \u2014 not one of the issues currently before the Supreme Court \u2014 prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to fire back at the president for the first time for feeding perceptions of a biased judiciary.\n\nJoshua Matz, publisher of the liberal Take Care blog, said the timing of the administration\u2019s effort to get the Supreme Court involved in the issues at an early stage could hardly be worse for Roberts and other justices who have sought to dispel perceptions that the court is merely a political institution, especially since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At an especially sensitive moment for the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is \u201cforcing it into a minefield that many justices would almost surely prefer to avoid,\u201d Matz said.\n\nThe Supreme Court almost always waits to get involved in a case until both a trial and appeals court have ruled in it. Often, the justices wait until courts in different areas of the country have weighed in and come to different conclusions about the same legal question.\n\nSo it\u2019s rare for the justices to intervene early as the Trump administration has been pressing them to do. One famous past example is when the Nixon administration went to court to try to prohibit the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nIn the immigration case, the administration told the high court that it should step in and decide the fate of DACA ahead of an appeals court\u2019s ruling because the policy otherwise could be in place until the middle of 2020 before the justices might otherwise rule. The appeals court has since ruled, but the administration\u2019s request that the court hear the case stands.\n\nIn the military case, the administration argued that the Supreme Court should step in before an appeals court rules because the case \u201cinvolves an issue of imperative public importance: the authority of the U.S. military to determine who may serve in the Nation\u2019s armed forces.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Peter Renn, an attorney for Lambda Legal, which brought one of the challenges to the transgender military policy, called the Trump administration\u2019s action Friday a \u201chighly unusual step\u201d that is \u201cwildly premature and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon initially lifted its ban on transgender troops serving openly in the military in 2016, under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. But the Trump administration revisited that policy, with Trump ultimately issuing an order banning most transgender troops from serving in the military except under limited circumstances. Several lawsuits were filed over the administration\u2019s policy change, with lower courts all ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nStill ongoing in lower courts are the census and climate change cases. The Supreme Court for now has refused to block the climate change trial. In the census question case, the court has agreed to decide what kind of evidence a trial judge can consider and indefinitely put off questioning of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. But it rejected an administration request to delay the trial and allowed other depositions to take place."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Lied When He Said CIA Didn't Link Saudi Prince To Khashoggi Killing: Senator Jack Reed", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senator-jack-reed-trump-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman-jamal-khashoggi-killing_us_5bf887dde4b03b230fa18d4e", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Despite President Donald Trump\u2019s insistence to the contrary, the CIA determined that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said Rhode Island Sen.

They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran,\u201d the president wrote.\n\nHe also said in the statement that Khashoggi, a harsh critic of the royal family who was living in the U.S. and writing for The Washington Post, had been called an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d by Saudi officials. As for whether the prince knew about his killing, Trump wrote, \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nAsked why he believes Trump is supporting the Saudis, Reed responded, \u201cI think he feels that he has an arrangement with the Saudis in terms of the region, where they will act on behalf of their own interests but he hopes for the United States\u2019 interests.\u201d Trump has emphasized a \u201cwildly exaggerated\u201d financial benefit to stay on good terms with the Saudis, Reed added.\n\nIn addition, the president \u201cprobably has had business relationships\u201d and \u201cmight even be thinking in the future of business relationships with the Saudis,\u201d said Reed. \u201cSo he\u2019s put himself in a compromised position.\u201d\n\nThe president on Thursday repeated his support for Mohammed in a meeting with the press at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s country club in Florida. At one point, when a reporter asked about the CIA\u2019s conclusion, Trump responded, \u201cThey didn\u2019t conclude. They didn\u2019t conclude. I\u2019m sorry ... nobody\u2019s concluded.\u201d\n\nHe said of the killing Thursday, \u201cI hate the crime ... I will tell you this: The crown prince hates it more than I do, and they have vehemently denied\u201d any role in the killing.\n\nAsked who should be held accountable for the killing, Trump answered, \u201cMaybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a very, very vicious place.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "\u2018Shrek' Writer Terry Rossio Likens Being Called 'Anti-Vax' To The 'N-Word'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/terry-rossio-n-word-tweet-anti-vaxx_us_5bf92a12e4b0771fb6b8f394", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Hollywood screenwriter Terry Rossio faced online backlash Friday after he used a racial slur in a tweet railing against vaccines, reported multiple media outlets.\n\nRossio, 58, sparked anger after he claimed that calling someone who was against vaccinations \u201cAnti-Vax\u201d was the \u201cequivalent to calling someone\u201d the N-word.

He\u2019d been stabbed 13 times outside a nightclub in the Washington, D.C., area and taken by helicopter to a medical center, where doctors performed lifesaving surgery.\n\nBullock\u2019s sense of relief quickly faded, first into physical pain and anxiety, then into fear and finally into a rage toward his attackers.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like they put a hit out on me,\u201d said Bullock, now 30. He recalled friends coming to his hospital room to stand guard.\n\nJust days after the stabbing, Bullock had recovered enough to return home to the Washington neighborhood where he said he\u2019d had a beef with the individuals who\u2019d tried to kill him. Bullock was prepared to defend himself but also ready to hit back.\n\nBut before he could act, Bullock got a call from Joseph Richardson Jr., a University of Maryland associate professor, offering him an alternative. Richardson, now 50, invited him to participate in a study on young black men who had been shot or stabbed more than once \u2015 repeat victims of violence sometimes referred to as \u201cfrequent flyers.\u201d Bullock was hesitant, thinking Richardson might be working with police, but in the end he decided to sign up.\n\nThat study ultimately saved his life.\n\nGun violence is an American crisis that leads to more than 33,000 deaths each year \u2015 about a third of which are homicides \u2015 and tens of thousands more nonfatal shootings, according to federal data. Preventing that violence has been a topic of debate for decades, with politicians making glacial progress. But Richardson and others have decided to pursue another route, offering patients a glimpse into a less violent future that isn\u2019t hampered by the political stalemate.\n\nIn September 2017, Richardson launched the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program out of the Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in Cheverly, where Bullock was treated. The program, which arose from Richardson\u2019s initial study, takes a public health approach, treating violence like a disease that can both be spread and \u201cinoculated\u201d against, said Richardson, who now serves as co-director.\n\nThomas Bacho/University of Maryland Che Bullock, left, and Joseph Richardson Jr. are helping patients find a path away from violence through their work at the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program in Maryland.\n\nThe model is the area\u2019s first hospital-based violence intervention program, or HVIP, and is one of about 30 accredited programs in the U.S., with a few more in development and a handful operating internationally.\n\nHVIPs target the structural causes of violence \u2015 many of which spring from broader racial and socioeconomic inequalities \u2015 giving survivors tools to make lifestyle changes that can prevent them from being re-victimized or from perpetrating further violence. Research shows HVIPs have been effective at reducing violent injury and death, which can lead to substantial savings on health care and criminal justice costs.\n\nRichardson\u2019s program, which also serves victims of stabbings and other traumas, has seen promising results in its first year, but it doesn\u2019t yet have enough data for a full analysis on results. Of the more than 100 patients so far enrolled, none has been re-hospitalized for violent injury, he said. Before the program\u2019s launch, one-third of all violently injured patients they saw had been hospitalized two or more times before.\n\nSave A Life And Pay It Forward\n\nBullock\u2019s road to rehabilitation began in 2013 with a simple question.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things Dr. Richardson asked me is, \u2018What do you want to do with your life?\u2019\u201d Bullock recalled of their first meeting. Richardson, at the time, was working one-on-one with some survivors, helping them find social and mental health services.\n\nBullock didn\u2019t know how to answer the question, but Richardson, who has a doctorate in criminal justice, had an idea. He invited Bullock to speak about his personal experience to an African American studies class he was teaching on the modern Jim Crow at the University of Maryland. Richardson believed Bullock\u2019s life story was important; now he just needed to persuade Bullock to share it.\n\nThe following week, Bullock headed to campus to tell his story \u2015 ending with his attack \u2015 in front of more than 100 students packed in a room.\n\n\u201cYou could drop a pin in the auditorium, I guess that\u2019s how engaged they was,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nOn the drive home, Bullock\u2019s mind raced. His presentation was a success, and the positive response from students left him considering other possibilities for his future. Perhaps he could become a motivational speaker?\n\nBut just before he got on the freeway, someone shot at his car. The bullet missed him but shattered a window, leaving him with a gash on his forearm. It had only been a few weeks since his stabbing, and Bullock once again found himself traumatized and thinking about retaliation.\n\n\u201cI even remember finding out who did it,\u201d he said.\n\nBullock called Richardson to tell him what had happened. Richardson urged Bullock to meet with him before doing anything reckless. They met again and began to discuss the factors that had led Bullock to be targeted in the first place.\n\n\u201cI started to think about how I was getting my money, what were the forces of my financial capital,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it was drugs.\u201d\n\nRichardson suggested he try something different and cut him a check for $300 to speak to his class again.\n\n\u201cI made $300 in an hour, and the hustler in me is, like, how can I turn this $300 into $1,500?\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWhen I started getting more and more speaking engagements, I really didn\u2019t think about retaliating too much because I was focused.\u201d\n\nChe Bullock Bullock and Richardson have helped more than 100 patients in the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program's first year of operation. None has been re-hospitalized for violent injury.\n\nFor the first time, Bullock saw a different path for his future. He continued to work with Richardson over the next four years, helping Richardson develop the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program. When the program launched last year, Richardson hired Bullock to recruit survivors and serve as their case manager.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk into the rooms now, the first thing I ask is, what\u2019s the plan? What do you want to do with your life?\u201d Bullock said. \u201cMost guys don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBullock meets with patients daily while they\u2019re in the hospital. When they\u2019re released, he follows up, helping to set up goals and identify needs. Bullock also works with patients to develop \u201ccoping mechanisms\u201d to manage the stress that can stem from trauma, and he urges them to get mental health treatment, which he said can be challenging because of a broader stigma in the African American community against seeking help.\n\nAfter a near-death experience, experts say there\u2019s a \u201cgolden moment\u201d in which survivors are especially receptive to guidance. Bullock builds trust and rapport with the patients and then asks them to join the program. Some turn him down, but so far the program has an enrollment rate of over 90 percent, he said.\n\nBullock also works to reach out to the friends and loved ones of survivors, which is integral to the model\u2019s success, Richardson said.\n\n\u201cIf violence is a disease and this person who was injured was infected, you\u2019re trying to inoculate this person by giving them mental health services and getting them a job, but if you\u2019re sending that person back to a network of people who are still infected, what have we really solved?\u201d he said.\n\nInvesting In Prevention\n\nIt costs about $300,000 a year to run an HVIP serving about 100 patients, said Kyle Fischer, policy director for both the Maryland program and the National Network of Hospital-based Violence Intervention Programs.\n\nThe Capital Region program has so far not had trouble securing funding for the immediate future, said program director Dawn Moreland. But with around 740 survivors of violent injury coming through the hospital each year on average, she said, additional funding could help them expand to meet the needs of the community.\n\n\u201cThe volume will always be there, unfortunately,\u201d said Moreland. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have more clients to serve.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe HVIPs are a worthy investment. Gun violence deaths and injuries cost a total of $229 billion each year, according to a 2012 study that measured direct spending on law enforcement, criminal justice and health care related to shootings, as well as indirect costs like lost wages and the effects on victims\u2019 quality of life.\n\nIn other words, the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000, according to the study.\n\nA lot of the guys tell us that this is the first time someone actually cared what happened to them. Dr. Sean Benoit, co-director of the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program\n\nBlack men account for nearly half of gun homicide victims each year, but make up only 6 percent of the population, according to a 2018 report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nThis phenomenon is often referred to as \u201cmurder inequality.\u201d But the racial disparities of gun violence are also evident in the nearly unending stream of nonfatal shootings at the hospital, said Dr. Sean Benoit, a Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center trauma surgeon and co-director of Richardson\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThese guys come in after getting shot, we send them back out, they get shot and they come back in. So we\u2019re just patching them back up,\u201d Benoit said. \u201cWe have many patients who leave here not even knowing what surgery we did.\u201d\n\nMany survivors who find themselves at the Maryland hospital have normalized violence, seeing prison or death as acceptable or even inevitable, said Bullock.\n\nIn recent years, Benoit has made a habit of bringing his anatomy book to patients to show them how he\u2019s operated. He said it helps them understand how close they may have come to death. Small gestures like that can make huge differences, said Benoit.\n\n\u201cA lot of the guys tell us that this is the first time someone actually cared what happened to them, that this is the first time they have spoken to anyone who cares if they finish high school or get a GED or go to community college or get a job,\u201d he said.\n\nDo HVIPs Really Work?\n\nStudies indicate that HVIPs prevent violent injury, but the research has been limited in size and scope, often due to relatively small sample sizes and narrow sets of measured metrics, experts say.\n\nBut even in small studies, researchers are seeing success. By providing wraparound care to survivors, participants receive more opportunity for job placement, educational advancement, housing and even legal aid, said Rachel Myers, research coordinator of the violence intervention program at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of identifying people who have gone through this recent traumatic injury and really connecting with them in a human way,\u201d Myers said.\n\nFor survivors, just having someone believe in them can help them become productive members of society, she said.\n\nMyers, who contributed to a study on HVIP outcomes, said she\u2019d like to see future analysis that pulls from broader pools of clients and attempts to gauge how the programs are tied to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors.\n\nRichardson is also hoping to help expand the body of evidence on the effect of HVIPs. In the coming months, he said, he plans to begin the largest randomized study ever conducted on the effectiveness of HVIPs, which will include a sample of as many as 800 patients at participating programs in the Washington metro area.\n\nA New Lease On Life\n\nT.J. King, 35, grew up just a few blocks away from Bullock. He was hanging out in the neighborhood with friends in June 2017 when two men pulled up in a car and fired 56 times, striking five people, including King. All of them survived, but King\u2019s injuries were the worst. A round entered his back and came out through his chest, breaking two ribs and nearly hitting his lung and heart. After returning home from Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center, King got a call from Bullock, asking him to join an earlier iteration of the Capital Region program.\n\n\u201cI actually talked in that group about what happened to me, and how I felt and what I was going through,\u201d King said, explaining that he had never expressed himself like that before. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t tell [Bullock] this, but I went home after and cried for like two hours.\u201d\n\nJust months after King\u2019s shooting, his mother succumbed to Stage 4 cancer. King said he felt the best way to honor her was to continue improving his life. He stuck with the program and eventually got a job at Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center transporting patients. He also informally meets with survivors when Bullock is off duty. King said he hopes to join the program as a full-time employee soon.\n\nChe Bullock T.J. King, left, and Che Bullock at the Prince George's Hospital Center. Bullock helped recruit King into the Capital Region Violence Intervention Program after King was shot in 2017.\n\nNone of it has been easy, said King. It took a while to come to the realization that it wasn\u2019t worth seeking revenge against the people who shot him. King has also had to leave behind friends who weren\u2019t ready to give up the streets, he said.\n\nBut along with those changes have come a newfound positivity and passion for life. King woke up one morning a few months ago and decided he wanted to go fishing, he said. He\u2019d never fished before, but he\u2019d always been interested in it. He watched a few videos on casting and baiting, bought two fishing rods and headed to the Potomac River the next day. He caught his first fish.\n\nOver the past few months, King\u2019s love of fishing has grown. He\u2019s taught his friends how to fish, including the ones who were shot alongside him last year. Sometimes he\u2019ll take kids from the neighborhood to his favorite spots.\n\nBefore he got shot, King never thought he\u2019d be the kind of person who gets up at the crack of dawn just to sit by the water for hours, hoping for a fish to bite. Now there are fishing rods in his trunk at all times, he said, a reminder that anyone can transform their life \u2015 even if they need a little help doing it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Judge's Decision Dismissing Female Genital Mutilation Charges Sparks Concern", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judges-decision-dismissing-fgm-charges-sparks-concern-among-activists_us_5bf57f02e4b03b230f9db168", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "A federal judge has dismissed key charges against a Michigan doctor accused by prosecutors of performing female genital mutilation (FGM) on young girls \u2015 a decision that has prompted some concern among activists against the practice.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman dismissed conspiracy and mutilation charges against Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, a Detroit physician accused of performing the surgery on nine minor girls, and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, who reportedly allowed the procedures to take place in his Livonia clinic.\n\nThe same charges were also dismissed against two women who reportedly acted as assistants during the procedure and the four mothers who prosecutors say brought their daughters to Nagarwala.\n\nOther charges levied against some of the defendants remain standing, including one accusing Nagarwala of \u201cconspiracy to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.\u201d\n\nFor Friedman, a Reagan-appointee, the dismissals on the charges of FGM came down to the issue of federalism. In his opinion, Friedman wrote that \u201cas despicable as this practice may be,\u201d FGM is a crime that should fall under the jurisdiction of states \u2015 not the federal government. He found that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a federal law criminalizing FGM in 1996.\n\nBut some activists are worried about the message that the ruling will send to members of Nagarwala\u2019s religious community, Dawoodi Bohras, for whom genital cutting is still a deeply engrained tradition.\n\nMariya Tehrer is the co-founder of Sahiyo, a group that seeks to end FGM in the Bohra community. Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years. At the same time, since Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, some Dawoodi Bohra women have banded together to publicly defend the practice as harmless, and claim that governmental attempts to restrict it infringes on their religious freedom. Tahrer said she\u2019s noticed a movement to dismiss survivors\u2019 stories as attention-seeking attempts to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the community. And the sect\u2019s religious leaders in Mumbai still largely support khatna, Tahrer said, which makes it harder for local imams in India and the diaspora to publicly speak against it.\n\nStill, Tahrer believes the discussions the Nagarwala case have prompted within the Bohra community are a positive development."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'Real World: New Orleans' Star Danny Roberts Reveals He's HIV-Positive", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/real-world-danny-roberts-hiv-positive_us_5bf59e4ee4b03b230f9e1a3b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "J.

He posited that repetitive exposure to concussive blasts caused brain trauma that resulted in this strange grouping of symptoms. But once put to the test, his hypothesis didn\u2019t hold up. There were plenty of veterans who had not been exposed to the concussive blasts of trench warfare, for example, who were still experiencing the symptoms of shell-shock. (And certainly not all veterans who had seen this kind of battle returned with symptoms.)\n\nWe now know that what these combat veterans were facing was likely what today we call post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We are now better able to recognize it, and treatments have certainly advanced, but we still don\u2019t have a full understanding of just what PTSD is.\n\nThe medical community and society at large are accustomed to looking for the most simple cause and cure for any given ailment. This results in a system where symptoms are discovered and cataloged and then matched with therapies that will alleviate them. Though this method works in many cases, for the past 100 years, PTSD has been resisting.\n\nWe are three scholars in the humanities who have individually studied PTSD \u2013 the framework through which people conceptualize it, the ways researchers investigate it, the therapies the medical community devises for it. Through our research, each of us has seen how the medical model alone fails to adequately account for the ever-changing nature of PTSD.\n\nWhat\u2019s been missing is a cohesive explanation of trauma that allows us to explain the various ways its symptoms have manifested over time and can differ in different people.\n\nNonphysical repercussions of the Great War\n\nOnce it became clear that not everyone who suffered from shell-shock in the wake of WWI had experienced brain injuries, the British Medical Journal provided alternate nonphysical explanations for its prevalence.\n\nA poor morale and a defective training are one of the most important, if not the most important etiological factors: also that shell-shock was a \u201ccatching\u201d complaint. \u2013 (The British Medical Journal, 1922)\n\nShell-shock went from being considered a legitimate physical injury to being a sign of weakness, of both the battalion and the soldiers within it. One historian estimates at least 20 percent of men developed shell-shock, though the figures are murky due to physician reluctance at the time to brand veterans with a psychological diagnosis that could affect disability compensation.\n\nSoldiers were archetypically heroic and strong. When they came home unable to speak, walk or remember, with no physical reason for those shortcomings, the only possible explanation was personal weakness. Treatment methods were based on the idea that the soldier who had entered into war as a hero was now behaving as a coward and needed to be snapped out of it.\n\nLewis Yealland, a British clinician, described in his 1918 \u201cHysterical Disorders of Warfare\u201d the kind of brutal treatment that follows from thinking about shell-shock as a personal failure. After nine months of unsuccessfully treating patient A1, including electric shocks to the neck, cigarettes put out on his tongue and hot plates placed at the back of his throat, Yealland boasted of telling the patient, \u201cYou will not leave this room until you are talking as well as you ever did; no, not before\u2026 you must behave as the hero I expect you to be.\u201d\n\nYealland then applied an electric shock to the throat so strong that it sent the patient reeling backwards, unhooking the battery from the machine. Undeterred, Yealland strapped the patient down to avoid the battery problem and continued to apply shock for an hour, at which point patient A1 finally whispered \u201cAh.\u201d After another hour, the patient began to cry and whispered, \u201cI want a drink of water.\u201d\n\nYealland reported this encounter triumphantly \u2013 the breakthrough meant his theory was correct and his method worked. Shell-shock was a disease of manhood rather than an illness that came from witnessing, being subjected to and partaking in incredible violence.\n\nEvolution away from shell-shock\n\nThe next wave of the study of trauma came when the Second World War saw another influx of soldiers dealing with similar symptoms.\n\nIt was Abram Kardiner, a clinician working in the psychiatric clinic of the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau, who rethought combat trauma in a much more empathetic light. In his influential book, \u201cThe Traumatic Neuroses of War,\u201d Kardiner speculated that these symptoms stemmed from psychological injury, rather than a soldier\u2019s flawed character.\n\nWork from other clinicians after WWII and the Korean War suggested that post-war symptoms could be lasting. Longitudinal studies showed that symptoms could persist anywhere from six to 20 years, if they disappeared at all. These studies returned some legitimacy to the concept of combat trauma that had been stripped away after the First World War.\n\nAs veterans returned home from the war in Vietnam, combat trauma became less stigmatized. manhhai, CC BY\n\nVietnam was another watershed moment for combat-related PTSD because veterans began to advocate for themselves in an unprecedented way. Beginning with a small march in New York in the summer of 1967, veterans themselves began to become activists for their own mental health care. They worked to redefine \u201cpost-Vietnam syndrome\u201d not as a sign of weakness, but rather a normal response to the experience of atrocity. Public understanding of war itself had begun to shift, too, as the widely televised accounts of the My Lai massacre brought the horror of war into American living rooms for the first time. The veterans\u2019 campaign helped get PTSD included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the major American diagnostic resource for psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians.\n\nThe authors of the DSM-III deliberately avoided talking about the causes of mental disorders. Their aim was to develop a manual that could simultaneously be used by psychiatrists adhering to radically different theories, including Freudian approaches and what is now known as \u201cbiological psychiatry.\u201d These groups of psychiatrists would not agree on how to explain disorders, but they could \u2013 and did \u2013 come to agree on which patients had similar symptoms. So the DSM-III defined disorders, including PTSD, solely on the basis of clusters of symptoms, an approach that has been retained ever since.\n\nThis tendency to agnosticism about the physiology of PTSD is also reflected in contemporary evidence-based approaches to medicine. Modern medicine focuses on using clinical trials to demonstrate that a therapy works, but is skeptical about attempts to link treatment effectiveness to the biology underlying a disease.\n\nToday\u2019s medicalized PTSD\n\nPeople can develop PTSD for a number of different reasons, not just in combat. Sexual assault, a traumatic loss, a terrible accident \u2013 each might lead to PTSD. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 13.8 percent of the veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently have PTSD. For comparison, a male veteran of those wars is four times more likely to develop PTSD than a man in the civilian population is. PTSD is probably at least partially at the root of an even more alarming statistic: Upwards of 22 veterans commit suicide every day.\n\nTherapies for PTSD today tend to be a mixed bag. Practically speaking, when veterans seek PTSD treatment in the VA system, policy requires they be offered either exposure or cognitive therapy. Exposure therapies are based on the idea that the fear response that gives rise to many of the traumatic symptoms can be dampened through repeated exposures to the traumatic event. Cognitive therapies work on developing personal coping methods and slowly changing unhelpful or destructive thought patterns that are contributing to symptoms (for example, the shame one might feel at not successfully completing a mission or saving a comrade). The most common treatment a veteran will likely receive will include psychopharmaceuticals \u2013 especially the class of drugs called SSRIs.\n\nMindfulness therapies, based on becoming aware of mental states, thoughts and feelings and accepting them rather than trying to fight them or push them away, are another option. There are also more alternative methods being studied such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDR therapy, therapies using controlled doses of MDMA (Ecstasy), virtual reality-graded exposure therapy, hypnosis and creative therapies. The military funds a wealth of research on new technologies to address PTSD; these include neurotechnological innovations like transcranial stimulation and neural chips as well as novel drugs.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that patients improve most when they\u2019ve chosen their own therapy. But even if they narrow their choices to the ones backed by the weight of the National Center for PTSD by using the center\u2019s online Treatment Decision Aid, patients would still find themselves weighing five options, each of which is evidence-based but entails a different psychomedical model of trauma and healing.\n\nThis buffet of treatment options lets us set aside our lack of understanding of why people experience trauma and respond to interventions so differently. It also relieves the pressure for psychomedicine to develop a complete model of PTSD. We reframe the problem as a consumer issue instead of a scientific one.\n\nThus, while WWI was about soldiers and punishing them for their weakness, in the contemporary era, the ideal veteran PTSD patient is a health care consumer who has an obligation to play an active role in figuring out and optimizing his own therapy.\n\nAs we stand here with the strange benefit of the hindsight that comes with 100 years of studying combat-related trauma, we must be careful in celebrating our progress. What is still missing is an explanation of why people have different responses to trauma, and why different responses occur in different historical periods. For instance, the paralysis and amnesia that epitomized WWI shell-shock cases are now so rare that they don\u2019t even appear as symptoms in the DSM entry for PTSD. We still don\u2019t know enough about how soldiers\u2019 own experiences and understandings of PTSD are shaped by the broader social and cultural views of trauma, war and gender. Though we have made incredible strides in the century since World War I, PTSD remains a chameleon, and demands our continued study."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Admits To Targeting Billionaire George Soros In PR Attack", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-target-george-soros-billionaire_us_5bf5d6f2e4b0771fb6b5b1ec", "accessed_time": "2018-11-24 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook officials on Wednesday admitted to digging up dirt on Jewish billionaire George Soros and its competitors less than a week after The New York Times published an explosive expos\u00e9 on the tech giant.\n\nElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s head of communication and policy, published a blog post detailing the company\u2019s decision to hire Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, and why it aimed its effort at the company\u2019s critics, including Soros.\n\n\u201cSome of this work is being characterized as opposition research,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cBut I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied having any knowledge of the company\u2019s PR campaign against Soros until the Times investigation, which also found negative campaigns aimed at Apple and Google, was made public.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, also denied having knowledge of the hiring of Definers.

Others, like malaria and H.I.V., utterly frustrate scientists to this day, despite astonishing new weapons like gene-editing.\n\nWe have a vaccine for Ebola that protects nearly 100 percent of its recipients, but we are lucky to get a routine flu shot that works half that well.\n\nWe have children\u2019s vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, chickenpox, polio, hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae and meningococcal disease.\n\nThey have changed our expectations of mortality \u2014 and of parenthood. In 17th century England, one-third of all children died before age 15.

Many with diabetes no longer need insulin. Cholesterol and blood pressure levels tend to fall. Sleep apnea disappears. Backs, hips and knees stop aching.\n\nThere are not nearly enough surgeons or facilities to operate on all the obese people who might be helped by bariatric surgery, noted Randy Seeley, director of the nutrition research center at the University of Michigan.\n\nAnd many patients and doctors persist in thinking \u2014 all evidence to the contrary \u2014 that if overweight people really set their minds to it, they could get thin and stay thin.\n\nScientists got an unsparing look at what they were up against 50 years ago, when a clinical researcher at Rockefeller University, Dr. Jules Hirsch, did some old-fashioned experiments. He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.\n\nThe subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.\n\nDr. Hirsch and Dr. Rudy Leibel, now at Columbia University, repeated the study again and again, with the same result. Eventually, they found that when a very fat person diets down to a normal weight, he or she physiologically comes to resemble a starving person, craving food with an avidity that is hard to imagine.\n\nThe lesson never really penetrated the popular consciousness. Just a couple of years ago, Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, made headlines with a study of contestants from the Biggest Loser television show. They lost enormous amounts of weight, he found, but rarely could keep it off."}]
