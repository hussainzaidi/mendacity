And as it braces for a punishing new era of Democratic oversight, Trump's team is also gearing up for the imminent escalation in the President's re-election campaign.\n\nIf that was not enough, the new chief of staff will also be faced with the likely hopeless task of trying to tame a President who appears to be deeply rattled by Mueller's strides in recent days, despite his insistence that everything is sunny in the White House.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it!\" Trump tweeted Sunday.\n\n\"All of this despite the Fake News Media, which has gone totally out of its mind - truly the Enemy of the People!\"\n\nWashington is buzzing with rumors about who Trump could choose to run the West Wing, including the names of budget chief Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Rep. Mark Meadows, who chairs the conservative House Freedom caucus\n\nTwo sources told CNN that one of the reasons Ayers did not take the job was because of resistance from first lady Melania Trump and some other senior staff.\n\nSuch inner White House turmoil is one reason why other candidates might think twice about taking the position.\n\n'Impeachable' offenses\n\nThe job of chief staff is often thankless and exhausting even in a conventional administration. And whoever eventually decides to become Trump's third chief will face more than the complications of dealing with a President who constantly torches the conventions of his office and who revels at being the epicenter of an atmosphere of chaos, backstabbing and recrimination.\n\nHe or she will also inherit a White House that is more deeply threatened by a criminal investigation and allegations of abuse of power than at any time since the Nixon administration. And every week, the situation gets darker with the President under threat from formidable prosecutors on two fronts -- from Mueller who works under the supervision of the Justice Department and from the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nSeveral weeks of disclosures by Mueller have made it clear that the President and his West Wing are now directly threatened by the investigation.\n\nTherefore, anyone coming into the Trump White House from outside will do so in the knowledge that they are entering a situation that could expose them to reputational, political and even personal legal jeopardy.\n\nThe new chief of staff will work for a President who has been accused, effectively by his own Justice Department, of directing and cooperating in the commission of a crime -- in payoffs to women who accused him of affairs, in contravention of campaign finance laws.\n\nOn Sunday, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who will run the Judiciary Committee in the new Democratic House, suggested that the accusations, contained in filings about the case of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen by the Southern District, imperiled Trump's presidency.\n\n\"They would be impeachable offenses. Whether they're important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question,\" Nadler said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"But certainly, they're impeachable offenses, because, even though they were committed before the President became President, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office.\"\n\nWhile it appears unlikely that Democrats would seek to impeach Trump solely on the basis of campaign finance violations, recent weeks have made clear that Mueller's investigation is broader than was publicly evident and could find worse alleged transgressions by the President and those around him.\n\nFor months, the line from the Trump White House has been that there was \"no collusion\" in a Russian election meddling effort in 2016.\n\nBut the special counsel investigation is now uncovering multiple approaches by Russians to the Trump campaign and revealing the openness of key figures to those approaches and their propensity to lie about the contacts.\n\nSo there is a genuine possibility that the next chief of staff could find himself presiding over a White House embroiled in an impeachment drama \u2014 and leading a war room battling to maintain GOP support for the President in the event that he would go on trial in the Senate.\n\nWhite House under scrutiny\n\nJust days after the President said there was nothing wrong with pursuing a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow while he was a private citizen, Mueller suggested there might be.\n\nFrom court filings, it appears the special counsel believes that it was relevant that Trump was pursuing a deal with hundreds of millions at stake, which may have needed the help of a foreign power -- Russia -- that was at the same actively interfering in the election and had developed a preference for his candidacy.\n\nAnd it is now clear that Mueller's probe into alleged obstruction of justice by the President runs far deeper than the events surrounding the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The revelation that Mueller recently interviewed Kelly, reported by CNN, as well as last week's court documents, make clear that activity in the White House in 2017 and 2018 is also under scrutiny. That's because Kelly did not even take the job until July 2017 -- two months after Comey was fired.\n\nMueller has so far not made any direct accusations against the President or senior officials. But embedded in recent court filings is the possibility that he is looking at whether there were efforts by the administration to thwart investigations by his team and Congress.\n\nFor instance, in a sentencing memo, Cohen's lawyers said their client was in \"close and regular contact\" with White House staff and Trump's lawyers ahead of congressional testimony in which Cohen lied by saying the proposed Moscow project was off the table by the time of the Iowa caucuses in 2016.\n\nMueller's filings also note that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was in touch with senior officials even after he was indicted.\n\nThis all makes it clear that after months when Mueller was dealing with Trump associates from his past life as a businessman and on the campaign, his investigation is now penetrating the White House itself and is interested in events that took place long after the campaign ended.\n\nTrump's defenders correctly argue that Mueller has yet to directly accuse the President of any criminal actions. And it is often overlooked that Mueller's filings are the work of a prosecutor who by definition is making the best possible presentation of a case not yet challenged in court.\n\nBut the direction of Mueller's investigation appears clear. He is getting closer and closer to the President and his inner circle.\n\nAnd sooner or later it will be up to the next chief of staff to navigate the White House through a crisis that could put his boss's presidency in existential danger."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Ayers not taking job as White House chief of staff", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8bGzeDIR2aI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Nick Ayers, the leading candidate to replace John Kelly as President Donald Trump's chief of staff, announced Sunday he will not be taking the job, reviving discussions about who will succeed the retired Marine general when he leaves at the end of the month.\n\nAyers, who has served as Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff for more than a year, turned down the position because he could not agree to terms with the President, a White House official told CNN.\n\nTrump pushed Ayers to commit to two years, but he declined. He has young children, he told the President, and wants to move back to his home state of Georgia. He offered to become chief of staff temporarily, but Trump was firm on a two-year commitment, and talks fell apart.\n\nThere was also a significant resistance inside the West Wing to Ayers becoming chief of staff, two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN. Ayers, who considered the top contender to succeed Kelly for at least six months, will leave his position as Pence's chief of staff at the end of the year to run the super PAC set up to assist the President's re-election campaign.\n\n\"Thank you @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and my great colleagues for the honor to serve our Nation at The White House.

Thank you Nick! Karen and I wish you, Jamie and the kids every blessing in the years ahead.\"\n\nAyers' decision not to take the job came as a surprise since he had been lobbying for the position, the sources said. There was resistance to him being appointed from first lady Melania Trump and some senior staff, the sources said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that Ayers would not be taking the job as Trump's chief of staff.\n\nTrump told reporters Saturday that Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general and Trump's previous secretary of homeland security, will leave at the end of year.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said.\n\nKelly's status had become endangered in recent months as his relationship with the President deteriorated. He was not on speaking terms with Trump in recent days, two officials told CNN, and their relationship was no longer seen as tenable. CNN reported Friday that Kelly was expected to announce his departure in the coming days.\n\nNow there is an open question inside the West Wing over who will succeed Kelly. Trump is considering four people, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday that he would be making a decision soon on who he would ask to fill the position.\n\n\"I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!\"\n\nOne name being floated is Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. White House senior staff asked outside advisers on Sunday what they think of Meadows for chief of staff, a source familiar with the matter said. Meadows speaks with Trump often.\n\nAnother person familiar with the matter said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is a possible choice and would likely accept if asked, but there are some complicating factors -- like Trump's irritation with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and frustration over the economy -- that could count him out. Mnuchin is also not seen as being politically adept as some other candidates who have held elective office, which was Kelly's main fault in Trump's view.\n\nA person familiar with the Treasury secretary's thinking tells CNN that Mnuchin feels very strongly that he can best serve Trump in his current role as top finance chief with a portfolio that includes top administration priorities. The source says that Mnuchin has never pursued this job or has ever considered himself for the role.\n\nThere has been some support for him to be the President's chief of staff among Trump family members, who trust Mnuchin's loyalty as one of Trump's longest and closest trusted advisers, says the source. They think Mnuchin both understands the President and would work in his best interests.\n\nEven so, the source says Mnuchin feels he can best serve the President in his current job at Treasury Secretary.\n\nThis source also brushes off criticisms that Trump is unhappy with Mnuchin over the economy's performance, saying the two men have only had positive conversations over the country's upswing in growth.\n\nAnother name frequently on a list of potential candidates is White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. A source close to Mulvaney says that while his name keeps coming up for the position, he remains uninterested in it.\n\n\"He is happy where he is,\" the source said, adding that Mulvaney is not \"angling\" for the chief of staff job nor has the President asked him to take the position.\n\nA source familiar with the discussions tells CNN that Pence has started to have conversations with close aides about who will be his next chief of staff.\n\nOne name that has arisen in conversation is his long-term adviser Marty Obst, who is still based in Indiana because he works in the private sector, but travels to Washington often and is frequently at the White House, according to the source.\n\nObst traveled with Pence to Indiana on Friday afternoon after being in Washington that day, according to the source."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Marco Rubio: Kelly will be hard to replace at WH", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/qEpz2Ww6yLg/sotu-rubio-kelly.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Read more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN) In the olden days of presidential appointments and nominations, the focus was justifiably on the nominees -- their background, what their policy positions said about the role they would play in an administration and whether or not they would get confirmed.\n\nBut the recent round of nominations in this administration also says a lot about Donald Trump. For one thing, all the nominees look the part -- a vapid and meaningless qualification that has, according to early transition team officials and Trump associates , proven to be a central driver in Donald Trump's decision-making on key appointments.\n\nHis newest selections? Friday, Trump announced that he has picked William Barr -- who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush -- to replace ousted AG Jeff Sessions. He also announced the selection of Heather Nauert -- the chief State Department spokeswoman -- to replace the outgoing Nikki Haley as US ambassador to the United Nations. At the same time, chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly headed out the door soon, with Trump eyeing Nick Ayers, Mike Pence's chief of staff, to replace him.\n\nHere is my bet on what's behind Trump's picks.\n\nDonald Trump believes that the job of the attorney general is to protect him.\n\nIt is a smart political move to nominate anyone who served under George H.W. Bush in a week where the late President's life of civility, collegiality and public service has been justifiably celebrated.\n\nJUST WATCHED AG pick Barr on presidential investigations (1992) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH AG pick Barr on presidential investigations (1992) 01:09\n\nBut Barr should not be mistaken for a mainstream or moderate pick. He is a strong defender of sweeping presidential power. Long before the Russia investigation and the national obsession with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in 1992 Barr helped President George H.W. Bush pardon key witnesses in the Iran-Contra scandal , cutting the legs from under the independent prosecutor.\n\nIn more recent months he has defended Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and advocated for investigating President Trump's political enemies, even defending the bizarre Uranium One conspiracy theory that targeted Hillary Clinton and has been debunked.\n\nThis nomination is about one thing: Donald Trump's survival.\n\nHe is betting on Barr's defense of the power of the President to fire anyone he wants at any time he wants; betting on his history of bucking independent prosecutors and his shared animosity for Trump's enemies. Trump is betting that as the person who will be overseeing the Russia investigation, and who is likely skeptical of the need for a subpoena Trump, Barr will protect him.\n\nDonald Trump doesn't care about or understand the role of UN ambassador, but he does care about Secretary Pompeo and national security adviser Bolton.\n\nJUST WATCHED From TV host to UN Ambassador Pick Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH From TV host to UN Ambassador Pick 01:41\n\nWho the UN ambassador is (or what the United Nations does) is not of particular concern to President Trump. It is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton who know from experience that the role can be a powerful one. The ambassador can publicly buck the administration, as Nikki Haley did, or serve as the unofficial leader of the diplomatic corps in New York -- driving the agenda and leading on key diplomatic relationships.\n\nThey don't want an ambassador who does that. They want to consolidate power between them and maintain control over the military-first, protectionist approach to foreign policy that they have driven in their roles. Nominating someone like Heather Nauert, without the relevant experience for this job, downgrading the role below cabinet level ( as Pompeo has advocated for) will ensure that foreign policy-making and the center of power on international engagement remains in Washington between Foggy Bottom and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nHeather Nauert has, for the most part, been an effective public speaker on behalf of the administration, and before that she was a visible and vocal Trump defender as an anchor on Fox News. They know they have a loyalist.\n\nAt the end of the day, President Trump relies on both Pompeo and Bolton, and after rocky relationships with their predecessors, he finally has two men in place who entertain his bombastic and arguably reckless approach to foreign policy. He is fine with Nauert serving in the UN role. He likes her; she is an effective public communicator. The rest doesn't matter to Trump. But Pompeo and Bolton do.\n\nDonald Trump wants to see himself in Nick Ayers.\n\nChief of Staff John Kelly is rumored to be on the way out, and this time for real. All bets are pointing to Nick Ayers, Georgia native and current chief of staff to Mike Pence. While Kelly has been a loyalist, even when he shouldn't be, their relationship soured months ago and there has long been a rumor of change in the works.\n\nSo why Ayers?\n\nJUST WATCHED Sources: Ayers may be Kelly's replacement Replay More Videos ...

Several news cycles from now, few will remember what was discussed at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires.\n\nNever mind that US lawmakers and other world leaders have castigated the Saudi crown prince over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Putin's embrace of MBS telegraphed a message of unabashed support for Saudi Arabia, even as the Trump administration tries to contain the political fallout from the murder.\n\nPutin is certainly one to sense an opening. His personal outreach builds upon a burgeoning oil alliance between Moscow and Riyadh . Perhaps more importantly, it comes as his well-established rapport with US President Donald Trump is starting to look a little bit wobbly.\n\nAnd it accompanies a confrontation with the US over arms control: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced this week that the US will stop adhering to a decades-old nuclear treaty in 60 days unless Russia returns to compliance with the agreement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the Helsinki summit in July 2018.\n\nPointed snub to Putin\n\nHow quickly things have changed since the Helsinki summit in July. Less than half a year ago, Trump stunned observers by appearing to side with Putin over the US intelligence community, saying he took the Kremlin leader at his word over his denials of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe G20 summit was originally billed as a sort of Helsinki 2.0: Trump and Putin were supposed to have a lengthy meeting on the sidelines of the summit, where they would have wide-ranging discussions about matters of strategic importance.\n\nThat bilateral meeting, however, was scuttled after an incident around the Kerch Strait, where Russian and Ukrainian vessels clashed at sea on November 25. The confrontation between Kiev and Moscow quickly ramped up: Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 service members, and Trump cancelled his meeting with Putin , saying it would be inappropriate for him to meet while the crisis was unresolved.\n\nIt was a pointed snub to Putin, who said it was a \"pity\" that he was unable to have a full-fledged meeting with Trump, because, as he put it, \"the time is ripe particularly with the problems around strategic stability.\"\n\nTrump's volte-face came after his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen leveled fresh allegations in court about the President's business dealings with Russia. And the Russians were quick to cast doubt on Trump's reasons for canceling the bilateral meeting.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova last week suggested that the \"US domestic political situation\" was the real reason for the cancellation of the G20 meeting.\n\n\"Was the provocation organized by Kiev in this region the real reason for cancellation?\" Zakharova said, referring to the Kerch incident. \"Publicly, we heard just such an explanation, we took note of it. Is this a reality? I think that you still need to look for answers in the US domestic political situation. The dominant factor in making a decision is domestic political realities in the US.\"\n\nKremlin-aligned Russian media had a field day with Trump's cancellation.\n\nPro-Putin news anchor Dmitry Kiselev highlighted the Putin-MBS high-five on his program, adding: \"A dissonant contrast to everyone's mood was Trump, looking morose, sitting there with crossed hands as if he is trying to shield himself from everyone else, scared of blurting out something unnecessary. Looks like he was just not prepared for a coherent meeting with Putin.\"\n\nVladimir Soloviev, another pro-Kremlin presenter, took a similar dig at Trump.\n\n\"Trump's volatility and unpredictability is the new brand of the White House,\" he said.\n\nReset that never came\n\nIn terms of Russia's perception of Trump, things have come a long way since the 2016, when his election victory was treated as a potential breakthrough in Russian-American relations.\n\nKonstantin Kosachev, a Russian senator who is chair of the Federation Council's Committee on Foreign Affairs, summed up the new Russian pessimism about Trump and the United States in an interview with CNN. Like many Russian official observers of the American political scene, Kosachev believes Trump is hamstrung by the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"The current American policy towards Russia is not about Russia or the foreign policy of the United States,\" he said. \"It's about the domestic policy of the United States. America is still captured by these disagreements and emotions from the previous presidential campaign. Mr. Trump is being heavily attacked. And one of the tracks of this attack is the Russian meddling in the American elections, which has never been proved by any evidence. So, I believe that our bilateral relations are kept hostage by certain internal political interests of certain political forces inside the US. And I am afraid we will trapped in this situation until the next presidential election.\"\n\nIt's a pivotal moment in Washington, with special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday outlining a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nFederal prosecutors said for the first time that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSeparately, Mueller said Friday that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied about five major issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \"contact with administration officials.\"\n\nThe accusations by Mueller add to growing signs that the special counsel's team has a wealth of evidence about contacts between people close to Trump -- even in the White House -- and Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIt also comes after Mueller told a federal court that Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, had given \"substantial assistance\" to the Russia investigation and should not receive jail time.\n\nBut with the Mueller probe coming to a head, Russia's line has been consistent: There was no meddling, therefore the probe is groundless.\n\nAsked in a conference call this week with reporters to comment on the Mueller probe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was dismissive.\n\n\"We have enough other concerns, so this is not a priority topic for our attention, frankly speaking,\" he said. \"I do not know what kind of breakthroughs there could be. That [information] now available to the public in many respects is mystifying and a raises a huge number of questions, we have repeatedly cited examples of the absurdity of such accusations.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Winter storm in the Southeast may make travel 'impossible'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/Tz8av45Um2o/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) One weather-related death has been reported in North Carolina as a result of this weekend's snowstorm.\n\nPolice in Matthews, about 12 miles south of Charlotte, said a tree fell on a vehicle.

And Trump has mounted a long campaign to discredit the special counsel, apparently seeking to devalue any eventual conclusions that are critical of his conduct.\n\nBut the deepening record of the Mueller investigation is raising the possibility that Trump's talent in creating alternative realities is facing its stiffest test yet.\n\nNew and damaging information for the White House comes at a time when every move by Mueller appears to bring his investigation deeper into the White House and Trump's inner circle, and shows it has expanded well beyond what may or may not have happened in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSo the President has every reason to change the subject.\n\nKelly's departure has long been expected given an apparently fractious relationship with the President and his diminishing influence in a riotous White House he once tried to tame with military-style discipline.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said, of a respected retired general who also served as his first homeland security secretary.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Saturday that Trump was in talks with Nick Ayers, who current serves as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, to succeed Kelly. But the elevation of Ayers is not certain, as he is looking to move his young family back to Georgia and may only want to do the job in the short term.\n\nTrump also took time to tweet about violence in France that has rocked the Macron government and caused the cancellation of fuel tax increases designed to wean consumers off fossil fuels that cause global warming.\n\n\"Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes?\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nDeepening jeopardy\n\nTaunting a fellow world leader who was once a friend but has recently criticized the President's nationalistic worldview might be a pleasant diversion for Trump, but cannot change the reality of the widening special counsel probe.\n\nMueller is clearly now looking not just at allegations of possible cooperation of Trump associates with Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, but at possible obstruction of justice even after the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That much became clear when CNN reported on Friday that the special counsel has spoken to Kelly in recent months. The chief of staff did not even take the job until July 2017.\n\nA series of filings and court action this week by Mueller, federal prosecutors and attorneys for the President's former lawyer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn appeared to significantly sharpen the threats facing Trump and key associates.\n\nNone of the documents amount to criminal action against the President himself. But they tell an indirect tale of allegedly questionable behavior by the then-GOP nominee.\n\nFor the first time, prosecutors said Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump, which broke campaign finance laws.\n\nMueller also drew a link between Trump's business interests and the Russian election meddling effort. He pointed out that work on a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project that continued until deep into the campaign in June 2016 -- and which Cohen lied about -- came \"at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nMueller also confirmed that he has benefited from substantial cooperation from Cohen and Flynn, and that he has documentary evidence in addition to testimony from witnesses. This raises the likelihood that he has built a comprehensive picture into what went on in the Trump campaign, the transition and in the White House, even though he is yet to reveal everything publicly in heavily redacted documents.\n\nTrump and his legal team insist, however, that the President is in the clear.\n\n\"When you look at what was revealed today, there's nothing that links the President to collusion with the Russians, so maybe they should fold up their tent, give a report to the Justice Department and go home,\" Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Pam Brown on Friday.\n\nGiuliani also said the President never told Cohen to pay women who claimed affairs with him, adding that such payments would not count as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe depth of the President's legal and political difficulties will only become clear when Mueller files a final report -- and Trump's team will have the chance to challenge his findings and make their defense.

White House senior staff asked outside advisers on Sunday what they think of Meadows for chief of staff, a source familiar with the matter said. Meadows speaks with Trump often.\n\nAnother person familiar with the matter said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is a possible choice and would likely accept if asked, but there are some complicating factors -- like Trump's irritation with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and frustration over the economy -- that could count him out. Mnuchin is also not seen as being politically adept as some other candidates who have held elective office, which was Kelly's main fault in Trump's view.\n\nA person familiar with the Treasury secretary's thinking tells CNN that Mnuchin feels very strongly that he can best serve Trump in his current role as top finance chief with a portfolio that includes top administration priorities. The source says that Mnuchin has never pursued this job or has ever considered himself for the role.\n\nThere has been some support for him to be the President's chief of staff among Trump family members, who trust Mnuchin's loyalty as one of Trump's longest and closest trusted advisers, says the source.

Turkish officials believe the calls were made to senior figures in Riyadh.\n\nSome of the details in the transcript seen by CNN's source have emerged in previous reports of the recording's content. But this is the fullest account of the transcript that has so far been published.\n\nIt is likely to increase pressure on the Trump administration, which has been determined to separate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from the murder, and sought to frame the issue as a binary choice between supporting or cutting off a key partner in the Middle East. US President Donald Trump has been at odds with the CIA, which, sources say, has concluded bin Salman personally ordered the killing.\n\nThe revelations also threaten to undermine a key plank of an initial Saudi explanation for Khashoggi's death, that it was a rogue operation that went horribly wrong.\n\nThe original transcript of the audio was prepared by Turkish intelligence services . Turkish officials have never said how they obtained the audio. The transcript would have been translated before it was shared with other intelligence services; CNN's source read a translated version and has been briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe office of one US senator, who has received a briefing on the investigation by CIA Director Gina Haspel, told CNN that the source's recollections of the transcript are \"consistent\" with that briefing.\n\nCNN asked Saudi officials to comment on the contents of the transcript as described by the source, and to provide comment from those named in it. A Saudi official said: \"The relevant Saudi security officials have reviewed the transcript and tape materials through Turkish security channels and nowhere in them is there any reference or indication of a call being made.\"\n\n\"If there is additional information Turkish authorities have that we are unaware of, we would welcome it being officially handed over to us for review, which we have requested numerous times and are still requesting. And, up until now; we have not received anything.\" The official did not address the transcript's characterization of the scene inside the Saudi consulate, nor Khashoggi's last words.\n\nA security camera image shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\n'You are coming back'\n\nThe transcript begins at the moment Khashoggi enters the Saudi consulate in a quiet residential district of Istanbul at lunchtime on October 2.\n\nKhashoggi thought he had made a routine appointment to pick up papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. But, according to the source, it dawns upon Khashoggi almost immediately that things are not going to plan, when he recognizes one of the men who meets him.\n\nHe asks the man what he is doing there.\n\nAccording to CNN's source, a voice identified in the transcript as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a former Saudi diplomat and intelligence official working for bin Salman, and known to Khashoggi from their time together at the Saudi Embassy in London, addresses him.\n\n\"You are coming back,\" the man says.\n\n\"You can't do that,\" Khashoggi replies. \"People are waiting outside.\"\n\n(Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e accompanied him as far as the consulate, with instructions to call associates if he did not emerge.)\n\nWithout any further dialogue, according to the source, the transcript indicates that several people set upon Khashoggi.\n\nNoises follow, and very quickly Khashoggi is fighting for air.\n\nIn one version of the evolving explanations for his death, Saudi officials suggested Khashoggi was accidentally choked. But according to the transcript, CNN's source says, the journalist's voice can be heard above the noise, repeatedly claiming he could not breathe.\n\nDespite his desperate pleas, the last discernible words the transcript records for Khashoggi are:\n\n\"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThe transcript notes more noises, and several more voices.\n\nOne of those voices is identified on the transcript by Turkish authorities as belonging to Dr. Salah Muhammad al-Tubaiqi, the head of forensic medicine at Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry, the source says.\n\nAside from Khashoggi and Mutreb, he is the only other voice identified by name on the transcript.\n\nAs the transcript continues, it is clear Khashoggi is not yet dead.\n\nThe transcript notes the noises that can be heard on the tape, almost in the manner that subtitles describe moments in movies where there is no dialogue.\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Scream.\"\n\n\"Gasping.\"\n\nThen, the transcript notes other descriptions.\n\n\"Saw.\"\n\n\"Cutting.\"\n\nTubaiqi is noted giving some advice to other people in the room, apparently to help them deal with the appalling task.\n\n\"Put your earphones in, or listen to music like me.\"\n\nDuring the scene, the transcript notes at least three phone calls placed by Mutreb.\n\nThe transcript does not specify the moment Khashoggi dies.\n\nAccording to the source, the transcript suggests Mutreb is updating someone, whom Turkish officials say was in Riyadh, with almost step-by-step details of what is taking place.\n\n\"Tell yours, the thing is done, it's done.\"\n\nThe word \"yours\" is taken by CNN's source to refer to a superior, or boss.\n\nThe transcript has been circulated to key Turkish and Saudi allies , including those in Europe, but only the United States and Saudi Arabia have received the recording itself, the source believes.\n\nThe working assumption among those allies is that Mutreb was talking to Saud al-Qahtani, bin Salman's closest aide, the source said. Saudi officials say al-Qahtani has been removed from his former position as media chief to the crown prince.\n\nThe transcript only records Mutreb's side of the conversation. Without a recording of that call, or more details of which number was called, further conclusions based on the transcript alone cannot be made.\n\nA portrait of Jamal Khashoggi during a remembrance ceremony for him in Washington on November 2.\n\nA source close to the Saudi investigation into Khashoggi's killing told CNN that Mutreb and Tubaiqi deny making any phone calls.\n\nCNN has previously reported how Mutreb, Tubaiqi and 13 other Saudis arrived in Istanbul by private charter jets and commercial aircraft on the day of and the days leading up to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTurkish surveillance video records the 15-man hit team arriving at the consulate shortly before Khashoggi, and departing a few hours later. A body double of Khashoggi dressed in Khashoggi's clothes is seen on CCTV leaving by the back door.\n\nIt is clear from the transcript of the phone conversation that the calls do not describe a terrible situation gone awry, or explain an unexpected set of circumstances, the source says. Instead, the caller appears simply to be informing someone of what is going on. Hardly, the source says, the actions of a panicked ringleader, but more the description of a situation going entirely according to plan.\n\nThe transcript is relatively short, given the time span it describes, the source told CNN. There is not much dialogue; certainly no hint of a conversation about why Khashoggi should go \"back,\" and no suggestion either, as advanced at one point by Saudi officials, that he had been drugged by the hit team.\n\nThere is nothing in this transcript that the source could describe as a \"smoking gun\" -- a snippet of conversation or phone call that directly ties bin Salman to the so-called hit team, and to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham on Khashoggi: Crown Prince 'complicit' Replay More Videos ...

Lindsey Graham's sentiments after hearing the CIA's assessment of Khashoggi's killing.\n\nGraham, who was among a group of senators to receive a classified briefing on the Khashoggi case, said earlier this week that he agreed with the conclusions of the US security services that bin Salman was implicated in the case.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health.

Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.\n\nGender imbalance\n\nWomen and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August.

One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse.

This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said. Improve their conditions, and you'll help their health, she said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Tackling climate change could save millions of lives, report says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/9NllOiZlJh4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Climate studies often pinpoint the detrimental public health impacts related to rising atmospheric temperatures, extreme weather events and other consequences of a changing climate.\n\nMeeting the commitments of the 2015 Paris climate agreement could save millions of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars by the middle of the century, according to the report.\n\nMeeting the goals put forth in the Paris agreement would be expected to save more than 1 million lives a year from air pollution alone by 2050, it says. Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that \"we are in deep trouble with climate change.\"\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.\n\n\"The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nThose recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.\n\nThe report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.\n\nGeneral climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.\n\nOnly about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.\n\n'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'\n\nThe new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication . She was not involved in the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED New climate change report issues stark warning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New climate change report issues stark warning 02:13\n\nIn October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nThen, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change showed how extreme heat from climate change already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide.\n\nAlso last month, the US government's National Climate Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to climate change-related impacts.\n\nThe new WHO report comes with a message that \"addressing climate change is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area.

led to an \"inaccurate\" story about federal funding of controversial fetal tissue research, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.\n\nHHS's National Institutes of Health has made no decision on whether to extend a University of California, San Francisco contract for controversial research involving fetal tissue, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS.\n\nHer statement contradicts Washington Post reporting Tuesday that the \"Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract\" with UCSF to test new treatments for HIV.\n\nAccording to the Post, an anonymous source said a National Institutes of Health official told a UCSF investigator that the decision to end a seven-year contract before its completion was coming from the \"highest levels.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Washington Post chose to report assertions that are completely false,\" Oakley said.\n\nOakley said that there were \"no traceable records\" proving these claims made by the Post's anonymous source and that \"multiple, on-the-record assurances from senior officials at both the National Institutes of Health and in the Office of the Secretary\" told the Post that the claims were incorrect.\n\nThe Post also reported that a letter from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the contract would continue for 90 days rather than the expected year-long renewal.\n\n\"No contracting official would have had the authority to impart any communication to UCSF that the contract was being cancelled because no decision has been made,\" Oakley said.\n\nRenate Myles, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said on Thursday that \"NIH did, however, send a letter to UCSF to notify them of our intent to ensure continuity of service for 90 days while the audit continues and until a final decision is made on the contract.\"\n\nDoan would not comment, though she said the \"research is conducted in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as ethical standards.\"\n\nOakley emphasized that \"a decision will be made when the contract has been reviewed, pursuant to the ongoing audit/review process\" initiated by the HHS in September\n\nThe battle over human fetal tissue research\n\nTwo months ago, the HHS did terminate a contract: one struck between the Food and Drug Administration (an agency within the HHS) and a biotech company that was slated to provide about $16,000 of human fetal tissue for federal research.\n\nThe FDA explained in a notice posted online that \"fresh human tissues are required\" to create mice with human immune systems, which is necessary when testing drugs \"for safety and efficacy.\"\n\nHowever, a response letter from more than 80 House Republications to the FDA called for the cancellation of this federal contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.\n\nIn September, the HHS not only terminated the contract, it stated that \"in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,\" it had \"initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\" while \"continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\"\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is obtained through elective abortions and is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows . Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration. In its September statement, HHS concluded that it is continuing to review \"whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue\" and \"will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit ruling: UK can cancel decision, EU court says", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46481643", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ECJ Image caption The case was heard by all 27 European judges last month\n\nThe European Court of Justice has ruled the UK can cancel Brexit without the permission of the other 27 EU members.\n\nThe ECJ judges ruled this could be done without altering the terms of Britain's membership.\n\nA group of anti-Brexit politicians argued the UK should be able to unilaterally halt Brexit, but they were opposed by the government and EU.\n\nThe decision comes a day before MPs are due to vote on Theresa May's deal for leaving the EU.\n\nMPs are already widely expected to reject the proposals during a vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday night.\n\nBBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the ruling made staying in the EU \"a real, viable option\" and that may \"sway a few MPs\" in the way they vote.\n\nBut he said \"a lot would have to change in British politics\" to see the UK remain in the EU, with Mrs May and the government having to change its mind to make it a \"political reality\".\n\nA senior ECJ official - the advocate general - said last week he agreed the UK should be able to change its mind about leaving.

The authors said this would enhance researchers' ability to understand how our environment changed in the past and therefore to build a picture of the impact of future environmental change.\n\nCan a digital fossil ever be as useful as the real thing?\n\nIn some cases, it is far more useful.\n\nImage caption Digitally recording 40 million fossils in the Smithsonian collection will take an estimated 50 years\n\nFor the vast majority of the digitisation project, museums will capture high quality images and all of the key information - age, species, where the specimen was discovered - to make available online.\n\nThat alone is valuable - studying digital marine fossils, for example, is already enabling researchers to understand how marine life in changing sea levels and ocean temperatures.\n\nBut the most detailed digital data can actually be better than a real fossil.\n\nProf Emily Rayfield at the University of Bristol uses CT scans of dinosaur skulls and other bones to build computer models for research.\n\n\"We can actually use the digital data to test how these animals functioned,\" she told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright Bristol University Image caption A digital diplodocus skull can be tested with software that reveals how the animal moved and ate\n\nWhile it would be difficult even to lift the real, fragile, fossilised skull of diplodocus, for example, Prof Rayfield is able to twist, turn, compress and stress her digital dinosaur bones to reveal how the animals would have moved, what they ate and how they interacted with their environment.\n\nThis helped her and her colleagues to solve one the great puzzles about the sauropods - the small-headed, huge bodied dinosaurs in the same related group as the famous diplodocus.\n\n\"People have wondered how an environment could possibly have supported and provided food for so many multi-tonne, plant-eating giants,\" she explained.\n\n\"One of the ideas has been that the differences in the neck length, the skull shape and the tooth shape enabled them to feed on different things.\n\n\"One of my students has been able to use the digital data to test this idea.\"\n\nThis essentially meant rebuilding each digital dinosaur's jaw muscles and testing how it bit and chewed.\n\n\"This showed that the different types of sauropods were indeed feeding in different ways and therefore probably on different types of food, which enabled the environment to sustain so many of these 10-plus tonne dinosaurs at once.\"\n\nProf Rayfield's colleague at Bristol University, Prof Philip Donoghue, uses digital scans of ancient, fossilised microorganisms to produce large-scale versions that reveal far more detail about how the they lived.\n\nHe told BBC News that a digital fossil would transform scientists' ability to study life on Earth.\n\n\"We need to ensure though,\" he added \"that a digital museum is properly and consistently recorded and curated, so that the data is of the highest possible quality.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The destruction of the Brazil National Museum in 2018 underscored the importance of digital collections\n\nThe BBC's Victoria Gill and Jonathan Amos are in Washington DC covering the annual American Geophysical Union meeting, the largest gathering of Earth and space scientists in the world."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's InSight probe listens to Martian winds", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46489199", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:00:54", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The seismometer data has been raised two octaves to make it more audible (best with headphones)\n\nA UK instrument has captured \"the sound\" of the wind on Mars.\n\nThe British seismometer package carried on Nasa's InSight lander detected the vibrations from Martian air as it rushed over the probe's solar panels.\n\n\"The solar panels on the lander's sides are perfect acoustic receivers,\" said Prof Tom Pike, who leads the seismometer experiment from Imperial College London.\n\n\"It's like InSight is cupping its ears.\"\n\nProf Pike compares the effect to a flag in the wind. As a flag breaks up the wind, it creates oscillations in frequency that the human ear perceives as flapping.\n\nA pressure sensor that is part of InSight's meteorological experiment also recorded the passing of the wind.\n\nScientists estimate the air was moving at between five and seven metres per second, from the north-west to the south-east. This fits with satellite pictures that show the tracks left by dust devils travelling in the same direction.\n\nNasa's InSight spacecraft is the latest robotic resident on the Red Planet. After making a dramatic touchdown on 26 November following a six-month journey from Earth, the probe is now surveying its surroundings and testing its systems.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the mission, which is sited on a flat plain just north of Mars' equator, is to study the world's interior.\n\nAs well as seismometers, InSight is equipped with a heat probe that will burrow into the ground, and a very sensitive radio experiment that will measure how the planet wobbles on its axis.\n\nThe data should reveal the position and nature of all the rock layers below the surface of Mars - from the crust to the core. It is information that can be compared and contrasted with Earth.\n\nThe wind recording is something that will soon be beyond the UK seismometers, which are known as Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, or SEIS.\n\nA few weeks from now, the package will be lifted on to the ground by a robotic arm and covered with a wind shield. This bell-shaped device will protect SEIS from the weather and allow the sensors to concentrate on their primary task of detecting earthquakes, or rather \"marsquakes\".\n\nCo-investigator Dr Neil Bowles, from the University of Oxford, said: \"To get the first data from the seismometer instrument package has been fantastic and even with a short test run the analysis is now full swing.\n\n\"To 'hear' the low-frequency rumble of the Martian wind on the lander being picked up by [SEIS] is really eerie and provides a strangely human connection to this very different environment.\"\n\nThe UK Space Agency invested \u00a34m in the seismometer package.\n\nThe organisation's head of space exploration, Sue Horne, said: \"This is brilliant news because it means we know the sensors have survived the rigours of landing on Mars and are meeting the requirements to achieve their science goals.\n\n\"It is just amazing to hear the first ever sounds from Mars.\"\n\nThe audio recordings released to the public are almost completely unaltered.

A result will be announced shortly afterwards.\n\n181201182945771\n\nHow will the vote work?\n\nIt is a simple majority vote.\n\nAll 650 members of parliament (MPs) in the Commons are eligible to vote, with a majority required for approval.\n\nAround 320 votes are needed to guarantee a majority as there are a handful of non-voting members of the house such as the speaker and others who don't take up their seats.\n\nAbstentions or absent MPs could mean the figure required for a majority is lower, however.\n\nThe unelected upper chamber House of Lords will not vote on the government's proposed deal.\n\nWhy is it unlikely to pass?\n\nOpposition to the deal is fierce. There are two central arguments against it.\n\nThe first is that the draft agreement is a watered down, inadequate version of the country's existing EU membership arrangement.\n\nThe second is that the deal fails to deliver on a clean break with the European project.\n\nScores of May's ruling Conservative Party MPs are expected to reject her proposal, while several opposition parties including the main opposition Labour Party have also said they will refuse to back it.\n\nIf May manages to win, what happens next?\n\nThe government will introduce an EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill to parliament for consideration and ratification, most likely in early 2019.\n\nThe bill will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny, involving several rounds of possible amending and voting.\n\nIf passed, the European Parliament and European Council will then each be required to sign off on the withdrawal plan prior to March 29 next year, when the UK is scheduled to depart the EU.\n\nThis will be followed by a so-called transition period and negotiations over a possible future trade deal between the two. EU law prevents such talks from taking place while the UK is still a member state.\n\nAnd if she loses?\n\nIt's unclear.\n\nLegally, the government will have 21 days to bring forward a new plan of action to parliament. That could provide May with a window of opportunity to go back to Brussels and push for revised terms of departure from the bloc.\n\nBut even if she wins concessions from European leaders, which is not guaranteed, MPs will be able to table amendments on a fresh proposal, potentially forcing the government to alter its Brexit strategy once again.\n\nAlternatively, May might push for a second parliamentary vote on the same withdrawal agreement in the hope the electoral arithmetic is changed by fears that a second rejection would risk a potentially catastrophic no-deal Brexit.\n\nPolitical events triggered by a parliamentary rejection on Tuesday could derail that entire process and take events out of the prime minister's hand, however.\n\nA leadership challenge, general election, second referendum, substantially renegotiated deal or no-deal Brexit are all possible outcomes."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn charged, re-arrested", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/nissan-chief-carlos-ghosn-charged-arrested-181210070205308.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Japanese authorities have charged former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn with financial misconduct, three weeks after the businessman was arrested.\n\nThe 64-year old former CEO of carmaker Nissan was also re-arrested on new claims of misreporting his pay, local media reported on Monday.\n\nIn November, Ghosn was arrested for allegedly under-reporting his salary between 2010 and 2015 by some five billion yen ($44 million).\n\nThe details of his re-arrest are still unclear, but local media said it was possibly related to accusations of three additional years of under-reporting his income.\n\nThe new allegations will restart the clock on his detention, allowing prosecutors to seek to hold him for another 22 days.\n\nBesides Ghosn, Japanese authorities also indicted Nissan for making false statements in annual reports and former Representative Director Greg Kelly, who allegedly masterminded the misconduct.\n\nBoth Ghosn and Kelly were arrested and remain in custody without bail.\n\nGhosn, who originally hails from Lebanon, was arrested on November 19 and has since denied the allegations made against him.\n\nIf found guilty, Ghosn could face a 10-year prison sentence, but it could take years before a verdict is reached, because the case might go through several courts before a final judgement is reached.\n\n181125061235578\n\nA towering figure in the car industry, Ghosn is credited with turning around several major manufacturers.

The unsuspecting soldiers had left their rifles at the barracks.\n\nThe townspeople were angry at the the colonisers for arresting their men and forcing them to work at camps.\n\nThe \"massacre\" of the US soldiers began with the tolling of the town's church bells. Forty-eight of the 78 US soldiers were killed, while those who survived scurried to the coast and boarded boats to safety.\n\nThe following day, fresh US troops returned to Balangiga with orders to raze the town. General Jacob Smith told his soldiers it would please him if they killed and burned and took no prisoners, urging them to leave the place a \"howling wilderness\".\n\nThe scorched-earth campaign eventually spread to the entire province of Samar, with local men being killed and women and children being starved. Historians have put the Filipino death toll between hundreds to tens of thousands.\n\nAdding to the \"massacre\" of the Filipinos, the US soldiers looted the church in Balangiga and carried off its bells as war trophies. Two of the bells wound up in a monument at an air force base in the US state of Wyoming; the third, a smaller one, at a US military facility in South Korea.\n\nAfter gaining independence from the US in 1946, the Philippines made constant efforts at getting the bells back from the US government, to no avail.\n\nChapter closed\n\nDuterte is the first Philippine president with outspokenly anti-US sentiments. He has brought up colonial era atrocities during public speeches on several occassions.\n\nHe has also made a policy of distancing the Philippines from the US as he \"pivots\" to China for economic and security cooperation.\n\nMany Filipino leaders past and present have criticised the US for failing to deliver on expectations as a treaty ally since 1951, especially in the face of China's occupation of several reefs within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.\n\nBut recently, the US has ramped up military, economic and humanitarian aid to the Philippines by several million dollars. And in August, the US government announced it would return the Balangiga bells to the Philippines.\n\nThe bells will arrive on Tuesday in the capital, Manila, where they will be officially received by Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana at a military base. On Saturday, Duterte will lead their reinstallation in Balangiga in a ceremony that is expected to reaffirm the two countries' ties.\n\n\"It means a chapter that was a source of irritation has closed,\" Jose Antonio Custodio, military historian, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The Philippines and the US can both move forward despite Duterte's incoherent theatrics against the Americans.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Scores of amputations in Gaza as Israeli troops aim for the legs", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2018/12/scores-amputations-gaza-israeli-troops-aim-legs-181210052244848.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Israeli forces deployed along the fence that separates Israel from the Gaza Strip have fired live rounds at rock-throwing Palestinian protesters ever since demonstrations demanding the right to return began in March.\n\nAnd for eight months, Israeli snipers have targeted one part of the body more than any other - the legs.\n\nThe Israeli army says it is responding to weekly assaults on its frontier by Palestinians armed with stones, grenades and firebombs.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:14", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "One House, Many Voices: Art Depicting the Best of US", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/one-house-art-exhibit/4693815.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Many different countries, voices and eras, but only one house.\n\nAmericans \u201cfind strength in diversity,\u201d explains artist Ellyn Weiss, who curated the One House art exhibit outside of Washington D.C.

She risked her own freedom to protest the plight of political prisoners in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s and co-founded the Moscow Helsinki Group, Russia\u2019s oldest human rights organization, in 1976.\n\nAlexeyeva faced death threats throughout her career and was forced into exile by Soviet authorities in 1977.\n\nShe returned to Russia in 1993 after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and continued her work energetically, but suspicion of non-governmental organizations under President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule increasingly impeded her activities.\n\nIn 2014, she announced that the Moscow Helsinki Group had laid off most of its staff and cut pay for the remainder. The move followed declining foreign donations in the wake of legislation requiring groups receiving such funding to register as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d\n\nAlexeyeva relentlessly pressed Soviet authorities to improve human rights, through times of crushing repression and those of relative tolerance, a job that required enormous patience.\n\n\u201cIn Soviet times, we couldn\u2019t do anything to defend human rights,\u201d she told The Associated Press in a 2009 interview. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even defend ourselves. Our activity was confined to proclaiming that the state should respect human rights and defend them.\u201d\n\nAfter the Soviet collapse, she turned into a respectful but insistent voice urging that Russia\u2019s newly elected leadership live up to its rhetoric about democracy and the rule of law.\n\nDespite Putin\u2019s early patronage, including his naming her to an advisory council, Alexeyeva was a leading critic of Russia\u2019s second war in Chechnya, launched in 1999 during Putin\u2019s first term as prime minister, and of Putin\u2019s weakening of Russia\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nGovernment officials later accused nongovernment organizations like the Moscow Helsinki Group of spying on Russia for the West, and Alexeyeva became the target of death threats by nationalist groups. Still, she remained determined and optimistic, maintaining her ties to the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t accuse, I explain,\u201d she said. \u201cI say, \u2018You don\u2019t agree? We will speak some more.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile she was certain that Russia would one day embrace Western-style democracy, she did not expect that it would happen soon.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t live to see Russia become a democratic state with the rule of law,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nStill, Putin made a house call to Alexeyeva on her 90th birthday last year, complete with a champagne toast.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Alexeyeva privately urged Putin to halt plans to expel thousands of Chechen refugees from camps in the neighboring region of Ingushetia and force them to return to their war-ravaged homeland.\n\n\u201cHe agreed, the camps existed for two years after that and the people lived in camps rather than under bombs,\u201d she said.\n\nIn December 2008, Putin proposed legislation that would have significantly broadened the definition of treason. Rights activists said the law would make anyone critical of the government liable to prosecution as an enemy of the state. After an outcry by Alexeyeva and others, the proposal was withdrawn.\n\nBut Alexeyeva and her allies lost at least as many battles as they won.\n\nAfter the December 2003 parliamentary election \u2014 a watershed vote that saw most of Russia\u2019s liberal opposition leadership driven from parliament \u2014 Alexeyeva recalled bluntly telling Putin: \u201cWe don\u2019t have elections anymore, because the results are decided by the bosses and not the people.\u201d\n\nBorn in Crimea on July 20, 1927, Alexeyeva studied archaeology at Moscow State University. She was drawn into the dissident movement during the Khrushchev thaw, the period of relaxed censorship under Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nShe was part of the small but determined circle of Moscow dissidents that included Sergei Kovalyov, a biologist who survived a gulag labor camp, and physicist Andrei Sakharov, who won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. The dissidents often met but seldom talked about their illegal political activities, working in secret cells to deter arrests.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Alexeyeva worked on the Chronicle of Current Events, the most important of the dissident underground journals typed up on onionskin sheets backed by carbon copy paper and circulated hand-to-hand.\n\nOne night Alexeyeva grew worried as she waited in a friend\u2019s apartment for a courier to deliver the latest edition of the Chronicle for retyping. When a knock came at the door, she hid, certain it was the KGB, before hearing the voice of fellow dissident Kovalyov. Until that moment, she said, she didn\u2019t know he was one of the journal\u2019s editors.\n\nKovalyov later spent seven years in a Soviet labor camp for his role in the publication.\n\nLike other dissidents, including author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Alexeyeva was threatened with arrest unless she left the Soviet Union. The mother of two fled with her younger son, Mikhail, in 1977, eventually settling in the United States. There, she co-wrote about her life in \u201cThe Thaw Generation: Coming of Age in the Post-Stalin Era\u201d and also wrote a book called \u201cSoviet Dissent.\u201d\n\nRussian dissident and human rights titan Lyudmila Alexeyeva has passed away at 91. She was razor sharp with an impish sense of humour. Always remember this lovely vignette from @EllenBarryNYT profile of her in 2010. RIP. pic.twitter.com/D3vhLqfOHb \u2014 Tom Parfitt (@parfitt_tom) December 8, 2018\n\nIn the 2009 interview, Alexeyeva recalled how Russia had changed since her dissident days. One major watershed, she said, was the 1976 Helsinki agreement, which introduced the concept of human rights to the world.\n\n\u201cNow every policeman knows what human rights means,\u201d Alexeyeva said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t enforce them, but he knows. That is why I think that today is much easier for us than in the Soviet times.\u201d\n\nMany liberal Russian have blamed the country\u2019s leaders for steering Russia toward authoritarianism. But Alexeyeva said Russia\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t its leaders, it was its weak society, which she said was incapable of holding leaders to account.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the leaders of Western democracies are really such strong democrats,\u201d she said, but added that Western leaders have to support human rights and the rule of law or risk being voted out.\n\nAlexeyeva said she often received death threats \u2014 and sometimes wondered if she dismissed them too lightly.\n\nShe recalled having tea in her kitchen in 2008 with Stanislav Markelov, a lawyer who represented Chechen families with grievances against the government. Markelov said someone was threatening his life, but Alexeyeva tried to be reassuring.\n\n\u201cI told him we all get them,\u201d she said, her eyes misting.\n\nMarkelov, however, was shot and killed on a snowy Moscow street in January 2009 along with Anastasia Baburova, a young journalist.\n\nStill, Alexeyeva said neither she nor her colleagues would give up their human rights cause.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of a single person who works with me who would stop doing what they are doing because of threats,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I stopped what I am doing now, life wouldn\u2019t be interesting to me.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "French Police Fire Tear Gas As Yellow-Vested Protesters Swarm Paris", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesters-march-through-paris-amid-fears-of-new-violence_us_5c0ba5d7e4b0a606a9a91fe4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 French riot police fired tear gas and water cannon in Paris on Saturday, trying to stop thousands of yellow-vested protesters from converging on the presidential palace to express their anger at high taxes and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nSecurity officials imposed a lockdown on parts of central Paris, determined to prevent a repeat of the rioting a week ago that damaged a major monument, injured 130 people and tarnished the country\u2019s global image.\n\nBlue armored vehicles rumbled across cobblestone streets from the Arc de Triomphe across toward eastern Paris as scattered demonstrations spread around the city. Police were mounted on horses and surrounded protesters with trained dogs. A ring of steel surrounded the Elysee Palace itself, as police stationed trucks and reinforced steel barriers in streets throughout the entire neighborhood.\n\nAssociated Press reporters witnessed multiple protesters hurt in Saturday\u2019s clashes with police. Paris police said 30 people were injured, including three police officers. An AP video journalist was wounded in the leg as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the Champs-Elysees.\n\nSome stores along the Champs-Elysee had boarded up their windows with plywood, making the neighborhood appear like it was bracing for a hurricane. Angry protesters on Saturday tried to rip the boards off.\n\nProtesters threw flares and other projectiles and set fires but were repeatedly pushed back by tear gas and water cannon. By mid-afternoon, more than 700 people had been stopped and questioned, and more than 400 were being held in custody, according to a Paris police spokeswoman.\n\nDespite the repeated skirmishes, Saturday\u2019s anti-government protests appeared less chaotic and violent than a week ago, when crowds defaced the Arc de Triomphe, set vehicles ablaze and looted high-end stores in the city\u2019s worst rioting since 1968.\n\nPrized Paris monuments and normally bustling shopping meccas were locked down Saturday at the height of the holiday shopping season. The Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were among the many tourist attractions that closed for the day, fearing damages amid a new round of protests. Subway stations in the center of town were shut down.\n\nThe yellow vest movement \u2014 named after the fluorescent outerwear French drivers must keep in their vehicles \u2014 started as a protest against higher taxes for diesel and gas, but quickly expanded to encompass wide frustration at stagnant incomes, the rising cost of living and other grievances.\n\nMacron on Wednesday agreed to abandon the fuel tax hike, which aimed to wean France off fossil fuels and uphold the Paris climate agreement, but that hasn\u2019t defused the anger.\n\nAfter two weekends of violence in Paris that made the authorities look powerless, police went into overdrive Saturday to keep a lid on unrest. Police frisked people or searched bags throughout central Paris, and confiscated gas masks and protective goggles from AP journalists.\n\nProtesters who came to Paris from Normandy described seeing officers block yellow-vested passengers from boarding public transportation at stops along their route. The national gendarme service posted a video on Twitter of police tackling a protester and confiscating his dangerous material, which appeared to be primarily a tennis racket.\n\nMacron\u2019s government had warned that the yellow vest protests had created a \u201cmonster\u201d and that Saturday\u2019s protests would be hijacked by radicalized and rebellious crowds.\n\nDemonstrators waving French flags, shouting the French anthem and wearing the movement\u2019s signature neon vests gathered before dawn Saturday near the Arc de Triomphe, then tried to march down the Champs-Elysees Avenue toward the presidential palace.\n\nRows of helmeted, thickly protected riot police blocked their passage down the Champs-Elysees toward the heart of presidential power. So the protesters tried other routes, marching through the prime shopping district that includes the high-end stores of Galeries Lafayette and Printemps and the Palais Garnier opera house.\n\nNational police estimated the number of protesters in Paris on Saturday at 8,000, among 31,000 protesters nationwide. They appeared to be outnumbered by police, with 8,000 officers deployed in the capital alone and 89,000 fanned out around the country.\n\nThe yellow vests include people with views that range from the far right to the far left. The group has no leaders but is united in its feeling that Macron and his government are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary French families.\n\n\u201cWe are here to tell (Macron) our discontent. Me, I\u2019m not here to break things because I have four children so I am going to try to be safe for them, because they are afraid,\u201d protester Myriam Diaz told the AP. \u201cBut I still want to be here to say \u2018Stop, that\u2019s enough, this has to stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nCyril, a garbage truck driver in Normandy who earns 1,430 euros ($1,625) a month, said Macron\u2019s mistake was trying to reform France too quickly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have kids because I have trouble feeding myself, let alone another mouth,\u201d the 25-year-old told the AP, saying he came to Paris to demonstrate and \u201cdefend myself.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner urged calm.\n\n\u201cI ask the yellow vests that want to bring about a peaceful message to not go with the violent people. We know that the violent people are only strong because they hide themselves within the yellow vests, which hampers the security forces,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nFour people have been killed in accidents since the unrest began Nov. 17. Christmas markets, national soccer matches and countless other events have been canceled due to the protests.\n\nProtesters also blocked roads, roundabouts and tollbooths elsewhere in France. Offshoot movements have emerged elsewhere, and yellow-vest protests were held Saturday in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump sought to fuel the anger in France, seizing the moment to criticize the Paris climate accord, which he is abandoning.\n\n\u201cPeople do not want to pay large sums of money ... in order to maybe protect the environment,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMany economists and scientists, however, say higher fuel taxes are essential to saving the planet from worsening climate change.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Here Are The Best Christmas Songs And Holiday Hits Of 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2018-best-christmas-songs_us_5c04e64fe4b0606a15b6bf7c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Every Christmas brings with it a new batch of holiday songs, from fresh takes on old favorites to originals hoping to join the pantheon of perennials.\n\nThis year, John Legend released his first Christmas album with his spin on such classics as \u201cWhat Christmas Means To Me\u201d (with Stevie Wonder) and \u201cHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\u201d (featuring Esperanza Spalding) as well as the new tune \u201cBring Me Love\u201d:\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Famer Eric Clapton also released the first Christmas album of his five-and-a-half-decade career. \u201cHappy Xmas\u201d lends his trademark voice and guitar to some classics, including a rendition of \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also got an original blues tune for the holiday, \u201cFor Love On Christmas Day.\u201d\n\nIconic actor William Shatner has a new album of Christmas tunes out. \u201cShatner Claus\u201d features multiple collaborations, including a \u201cRudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d with ZZ Top\u2019s Billy Gibbons.\n\nBut it also features an unexpectedly stirring rendition of \u201cSilent Night\u201d with Iggy Pop:\n\nGwen Stefani re-released last year\u2019s Christmas album, \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas,\u201d with a few bonus tracks including the original tune \u201cCheer for the Elves\u201d and her take on \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d:\n\nL.A.-based punk/pop duo The Dollyrots have released a few Christmas covers over the years, including a rocking \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d in 2016.\n\nThis year, they\u2019ve dropped a foot-stomping medley of holiday classics featuring a moshing Frosty the Snowman:\n\nWant some funk in your Christmas?

The president has denied the affairs and the hush money allegations.\n\nProsecutors say the payments violate federal campaign finance laws.\n\nThe first payment in question \u2015 $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels \u2015 violated campaign finance law restrictions against donations of more than $2,700 in a general election, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nThe second payment under legal scrutiny is $150,000 made by American Media Inc. to silence Karen McDougal, which prosecutors say constituted an illegal corporate donation to Trump\u2019s campaign. The National Enquirer\u2019s parent company was chaired at the time by Trump\u2019s longtime confidante, David Pecker.\n\nThe Southern District case involving Cohen stems from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nMueller did not take a position on Cohen\u2019s sentence but the special counsel\u2019s office wrote in their sentencing memo that Cohen has \u201cgone to significant lengths\u201d to help in their investigation.\n\nFox News host Ed Henry on Sunday appeared taken aback by McCarthy\u2019s prediction.\n\n\u201cYou think the president of the United States is going to be indicted...

Prime-time Fox News programs used the words \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cinvaders\u201d to describe migrants and asylum-seekers more times in the 30 days leading up to the Nov. 6 election than they did during all of 2015, 2016 and 2017 combined.\n\nI used transcripts to analyze the use of the terms \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cinvaders\u201d to refer to immigrants or asylum seekers on Fox News prime-time programming from Jan. 1, 2015, to Nov. 30, 2018. The analysis shows that, although the network was pushing anti-immigrant rhetoric before Trump announced his candidacy, a noticeable uptick occurred in the months around the 2018 midterm election. Prime-time Fox News hosts and guests used the words to refer to migrants 33 times in the 30 days ahead of the election, up from 25 times in all of 2015, 2016 and 2017. Fox has kept up the attacks in the weeks after the Republicans lost the U.S. House: Prime-time hosts and guests used the terms 48 times between Election Day and the end of November. Most of the mentions came from Fox hosts Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson.\n\nCalling migrants \u201cinvaders\u201d is a long-honored right-wing media rhetorical tradition. In 2002, far-right pundit Michelle Malkin \u2015 who regularly appears on Fox News, often to attack immigrants and refugees \u2015 published an anti-immigrant book called Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals and Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores. In 2015, Fox News used the term to spread anti-Muslim rhetoric in the context of the European refugee crisis. Ousted host and alleged serial sexual harasser Bill O\u2019Reilly branded the humanitarian issue as a \u201cMuslim invasion\u201d in his Sept. 15 show that year. During an episode that aired about a month later, O\u2019Reilly and his guest Monica Crowley focused on the \u201cfighting age\u201d or virility of those seeking asylum. Trump\u2019s former top adviser, Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, was another fan of the idea; he often describes The Camp of the Saints, a racist 1970s French novel about a literal invasion of Europe by people from other continents, as a prophetic description about the present.\n\nAnd Trump is far from the first Republican candidate to borrow from Fox News\u2019 bigoted rhetoric for electoral gain. Fox News favorite Bobby Jindal attempted to run for president by regularly using the slogan \u201cimmigration without assimilation is invasion,\u201d hammering on it throughout his short-lived candidacy.\n\nThe right-wing media noise machine has grown significantly since 2015, and the results of Trump and Fox\u2019s symbiotic relationship clearly has the power of inspiring extremists. The right-wing echo chamber now includes anonymous message boards like 4chan and 8chan \u2015 two video hosting platforms that amplified Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theories by airing content from his site Infowars \u2015 and social media networks like Gab, where extremists get further radicalized.\n\nWhen I analyzed \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d boards on anonymous forums 4chan and 8chan, I found that more than 2,200 posts referred to migrant caravans with the terms invasion or invaders. The trend showed an observable spike on Oct. 22, a day Trump tweeted repeatedly about the caravan.\n\nThe man behind the hate-fueled shooting on Oct. 27 in a Pittsburgh synagogue, for example, had posted six days before the shooting on the \u201chaven for white nationalists\u201d site Gab that he had \u201cnoticed a change\u201d in the way people on the platforms referred to immigrants. \u201cPeople saying \u2018illegals\u2019 \u2026 now say \u2019invaders,\u201d he noted. \u201cI like this,\u201d he added. His last post before the shooting attacked HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that helps refugees resettle in the U.S., for bringing in \u201cinvaders.\u201d\n\nAlex Jones repeatedly pushed the invasion narrative throughout October. Jones, whose extremist posts got him kicked off of multiple social media platforms, has previously bragged on air about his access to Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nAnd yet, President Trump and his right-wing media figures refuse to connect the dots between their rhetoric and the extremism it inspires or take responsibility for mainstreaming and empowering extremists.\n\nWhite supremacist podcasts praise Tucker Carlson, for elevating their discourse into the mainstream.

Instead, they were shown to be generally healthier than non-migrant populations and to contribute positively toward the nation\u2019s sustainable development.\n\nEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services.\" Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch\n\nIn the United States, specifically, research has found that immigrants payed more toward medical expenses than they withdrew, meaning they were a \u201clow-risk pool that subsidized the public and private health insurance markets,\u201d according to a Harvard Medical School and Tufts University report released in August. That same report also found that immigrants made up 12 percent of the population but only accounted for 8.6 percent of total U.S. health care spending.\n\nBut despite their contributions to the country, immigrants in the United States face significant barriers to health care. Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch, told HuffPost that legal immigrants often struggle to access health care due to a five-year delay in being able to apply for Medicaid, and because undocumented immigrants living in the United States often avoid preventive care for fear of deportation, ultimately relying on emergency health services. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health issue,\u201d she said.\n\nTerry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report and chair of Columbia University\u2019s Heilbrunn Department of Population & Family Health told HuffPost, \u201cOne interesting thing to note is that the immigrant health of Latinos, for example, often declines in the U.S. due to poor health care, health food, total lack of accessible mental health services.\u201d\n\nDespite accumulating evidence of health care needs among immigrant populations, the Trump administration continues to propose policies that could further restrict these communities\u2019 access to health services. In September, the administration proposed making it more difficult for immigrants who have enrolled for public benefits like Medicaid to either enter the U.S. or permanently stay here.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services,\u201d McLemore said, adding that Human Rights Watch is set to release an extensive response to this proposal because \u201cit undermines all public health objectives that you can think of.\u201d\n\nMcLemore also said her organization is collecting anecdotal evidence that shows immigrants are already hesitant to enroll in public benefits programs for fear that the proposal may take effect.\n\n\u201cAll of this is going to become a serious public health problem because whenever you are denying people health services [or] reducing access to health services, you are increasing the risk to the public health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for refugees, asylum-seekers, and other displaced populations.\n\nAccording to the UCL-Lancet report, the majority of migrants that cross international borders worldwide are either students paying for their education or labor migrants who contribute to their host country\u2019s economy. A significantly smaller proportion of this population are individuals forced to leave their home countries due to persecution, conflict or disaster.\n\nHowever, this small fraction of global migrants \u2015 refugees and displaced populations, of which nearly 53 percent are children \u2015 have the highest risk of exploitation, disease and death because they usually lack access to equitable health services in their home country and initially live in cramped refugee camps or shelters with substandard health services when they first arrive in their host country.\n\nIn the United States, this narrative can be seen playing out along the U.S.-Mexico border, where asylum-seekers crossing into the country are often placed in crowded detention centers where adults and children face an increased risk of disease transmission and mental health consequences.\n\nData on immigrants detained in the United States is hard to come by, but human rights advocates have worked diligently to put together a picture of what health care for these communities look like. A Human Rights Watch report released in June had independent medical experts analyze 15 cases of immigrant deaths in detention from December 2015 to April 2017. In eight of the cases, physicians found \u201cinadequate\u201d medical care had \u201clikely\u201d contributed to the immigrants\u2019 deaths.\n\nWhile these deaths represent a fraction of the tens of thousands of immigrants in federal custody \u2015 including nearly 13,000 children, according to The New York Times \u2015 the HRW report said the fact that the deaths were due to \u201cbotched\u201d emergency responses and \u201cpoor quality of care\u201d by officers and medical staff raised serious concerns.\n\n\u201cHuman Rights Watch has documented and continues to document inadequate health care in detention and that situation is just getting worse as the numbers of those detained increase and the facilities are overcrowded and are inadequately staffed,\u201d McLemore said, adding that the UCL-Lancet report only confirms what their research has shown in the U.S. for years.\n\nMcGovern said the discrimination and restrictions that migrants and asylum seekers face in the United States because of their status leave them vulnerable to negative health outcomes. Not to mention, restricting access to preventive care could mean a higher long-term financial burden on the country.\n\nPreventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or ... putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive. Terry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report\n\n\u201cI think this report firmly establishes that preventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or separating families so that children are traumatized or putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAll of those things are just going to ultimately cause more catastrophic health problems.\u201d\n\nThe solution, as far as the UCL-Lancet commission is concerned, is for governments like the United States to implement policies that give all migrants universal and equitable health care.\n\n\u201cWhen people are excluded from health services, they don\u2019t seek care \u2015 that means that chronic diseases and other conditions go untreated or unaddressed,\u201d Tessema said. \u201cThat has long-term consequences for the individuals and for the health system overall, which has to now care for people who would have otherwise been treated earlier with simpler and more cost-effective means.\u201d\n\nMcLemore agrees: \u201cLong term, when you have people either avoiding health care or going to emergency services when they get very ill \u2015 that\u2019s the most costly kind of health care there is.\u201d\n\nBut for McGovern, it\u2019s clear that neither health costs nor public health concerns are what\u2019s currently driving U.S. immigration policy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Humans Are Pooping Plastic, And No One\u2019s Certain How Bad That Is", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plastics-and-human-health_us_5c097d7de4b0b6cdaf5d3263", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "When Philipp Schwabl asked eight healthy people on four continents to take part in an experiment to see if plastic was present in their bodies, he had little idea what to expect.\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna researcher, who specializes in stomach disorders, asked them to keep a food diary for a week and record whether they had drunk water from plastic bottles, what brands of toothpaste and cosmetics they had used, and whether they had chewed gum. None were vegetarian, all had consumed plastic-wrapped food and most had consumed fish.\n\nThey were then asked to send a piece of their stool to an Austrian government laboratory where it was tested to identify barely visible microplastic particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters long.\n\nThe study, published in August, confirmed for the first time that microplastics are deep inside humans. All eight volunteers were found to have particles of most of the nine most common classes of plastics, including polypropylene and PET. On average, Schwabl found 20 particles per 10 grams of stool.\n\n\u201cI did not think all the samples would be positive,\u201d Schwabl said. \u201cThere is data on microplastics being present in shrimps, fish, oysters and mussels, but there was a question over whether they were present in humans. It is highly likely that during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging, food is being contaminated with plastics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smallest particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system and may even reach the liver,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need further research to understand what this may mean for human health.\u201d\n\nA clutch of studies looking at large plastic fragments in oceans has recently shown the world\u2019s most ubiquitous material to be present from the poles to the equator and to be a growing environmental hazard. Plastic in marine environments is now widely recognized to be a threat to many marine species.\n\nThe new awareness of plastic pollution is leading scientists to ask afresh how much the human body is being polluted.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Global plastic production has increased from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and is expected to triple by 2050.\n\nStudies have found plastic fibers and fragments present throughout the food chain, in plankton and fish larvae, bottled and tap water, seafoods, honey and salt.\n\nOne analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water. One widely sold brand had concentrations of about 10,000 particles per liter, and only 17 of the 259 bottles contained water that was free of plastic.\n\nOther research has shown plastic particles shed from degrading car tires present in the air we breathe in the street, in homes from the washing of synthetic clothes, and in the soil via sludge from water treatment works that is used as a fertilizer.\n\nWith global plastic production increasing from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and expected to triple by 2050, research is needed to gauge what effect growing human exposure to it may be having, say scientists.\n\n\u201cPlastic is non-degradable. It cannot be broken down and has the potential to persist in our bodies for a lifetime after exposure,\u201d said Stephanie Wright, a researcher at University College London who specializes in microscopic plastic pollution.\n\nConcern is growing that many man-made chemicals added to consumer plastics to give them qualities like stiffness or transparency may contain hormone-altering chemicals that have barely been tested. According to one study, detectable levels of bisphenol A, one of a group of toxic chemicals, have been found in the urine of 95 percent of the adult population of the U.S.\n\nPeople working in the textile industry have been shown to develop lung disease after exposure to nylon (plastic) flock, said Wright. \u201cContinuous daily interaction with plastic allows oral, dermal [skin] and inhalation exposure to chemical components. The potential for microplastics and nanoplastics so small they cannot be seen by the naked eye to cause harm to human health remains understudied,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Warhurst, director of European chemical watchdog group CHEM Trust, has, with academics, identified over 4,000 chemicals potentially present in plastic packaging, of which 63 have been identified as dangerous to human health because of their potential to disrupt hormones.\n\njapatino via Getty Images One analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water.\n\n\u201cMany chemicals used in plastics have not been tested for their endocrine-disrupting effects,\u201d Warhurst said. \u201cCurrent test methods are not very good at identifying all of them.\u201d\n\nSome of the most common are bisphenols and phthalates, used in everything from food packaging and toys to floor tiles and water bottles. They have been connected to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancers.\n\nMany countries have either banned bisphenol A or advised that it may be dangerous to children. The United States\u2019 National Toxicology Program has \u201csome concern\u201d for bisphenol A\u2019s effect on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. It is still used widely in Europe.\n\nBut other bisphenols and phthalates are not banned and are used frequently in the production of consumer goods. Many, said Warhurst, may be similar or even more toxic than those banned.\n\n\u201cA lot of chemicals are very similar to known endocrine disruptors. When one gets banned, there are others behind it. Chemical companies are required to provide data but it\u2019s not always comprehensive. There is no strict enforcement and companies can bring chemicals onto the market easily. More research is needed and much better control,\u201d he said.\n\nOther scientists have said the danger to human health, if any, may be in the smallest pieces, or nanoplastics. \u201cMicroplastics will not enter a cell, but nanoplastics are small enough to cross into cells and permeate the body,\u201d said Anne Marie Mahon, a researcher at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Ireland. Her recent research found sludge in water treatment works full of microparticles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that chemicals could be absorbed in our circulatory system or pass into our organs. But whether that is happening is unknown,\u201d Mahon said.\n\nIn sufficient concentrations, chemicals can injure and kill cells in the human body, said Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King\u2019s College London and one of Britain\u2019s leading authorities on air pollution. He wrote with Stephanie Wright: \u201cThe cells may be replaced successfully or they may not. If inhaled or ingested, microplastics may accumulate and exert localized toxicity by inducing an immune response. \u201d\n\nTheir research is backed by Philipp Schwabl in Austria. \u201cIn animals, some microparticles have been found in the liver and embedded in tissue,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on the amount, this could cause immune reactions. It\u2019s possible that the minutest particles are in the human blood and tissue but it\u2019s very hard to measure and we cannot prove it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need more research,\u201d he added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Could Prescription Heroin Help Stem Opioid Deaths In The U.S.?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prescription-heroin-opioid-deaths_us_5c0809bae4b0844cda4f5196", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Yahoo Canada News A tray of supplies at the Insite supervised injection clinic in Vancouver, Canada, where people are permitted to inject illicit drugs in the presence of medical staff.\n\nAs drug overdose deaths in the United States soar and life expectancy drops, researchers are looking to unconventional approaches to help stem the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u2015 including making heroin available by prescription.\n\nA report released by the nonprofit Rand Corporation this week analyzed the literature on two interventions \u2015 prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites \u2015 that already exist in Europe, Canada and Australia, but are still highly controversial in the United States.\n\nWhile prescribing one of the drugs at the center of the opioid crisis might seem unthinkable to the uninitiated, Beau Kilmer, lead author of the new report and the co-director of Rand\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center, explained that it can be an effective way to keep drug users safe if traditional treatments haven\u2019t worked for them.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just legalizing heroin or giving it out,\u201d he said, stressing that prescription heroin isn\u2019t a first-line treatment. Instead, heroin-assisted therapy involves offering pharmaceutical-grade heroin to people who have tried other treatments, such as methadone, and continued to inject. That dose of heroin would be used under medical supervision in a clinic, often with the option of taking methadone home to ward off potential withdrawal.\n\nThe researchers analyzed randomized controlled trials on prescription heroin in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and found strong evidence to support that drug users who were prescribed heroin were less likely to use illicit street heroin. Unlike prescription heroin, street heroin carries the risk of being adulterated with other substances, such as fentanyl, the highly potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the nearly 50,000 opioid deaths the U.S. logged in 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that people who received prescription heroin had better social and mental health outcomes and were less likely to engage in criminal activity than those who received methadone.\n\n\u201cFor these individuals, not only does it reduce their use of street-source heroin, but it also helps stabilize their lives,\u201d said Kilmer, who explained many people who have been using drugs for an extended period of time spend a significant portion of the day trying to get money to pay for heroin, potentially putting themselves in dangerous situations.\n\nThe report concluded that it\u2019s time for the U.S. to pilot prescription heroin.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of these programs in other countries, and given where we are in the United States with fentanyl poisoning, we definitely think that there should be randomized controlled trials of heroin-assisted treatment in the United States,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nThe new report found less robust evidence behind supervised consumption sites \u2015 where people bring their own street drugs to inject, using clean supplies in a hygienic clinical setting under medical supervision.\n\nAlthough previous research on existing supervised consumption sites outside of the U.S. found that these sites reduced disease transmission and drove down emergency calls and fatal overdoses, the new report concluded that there were too few studies, from a limited number of locations, to draw rigorous conclusions from.\n\nOn the other hand, Kilmer pointed out that those supervised consumption sites have been in existence for between 15 and 30 years, and have withstood multiple changes in national and local government. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sites are effective, but it does suggest that if they have negative effects, they\u2019re minor ones.\n\n\u201cIf there really was a significant downside for the individuals or the communities, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have such longevity,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nCultural and legal obstacles stand in the way.\n\nHeroin is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning there\u2019s no accepted medical use for it and doctors can\u2019t prescribe it. Human research on Schedule I drugs is permitted, but similar to the obstacles medical marijuana researchers run up against, prescription heroin researchers would encounter barriers, such as having to get research approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe new report suggests a workaround. It would be easier to start a pilot program on injectable hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid used for pain in the United States. There\u2019s less research on injectable hydromorphone than there is on prescription heroin. Still, the limited research that does exist suggests that like prescription heroin, supervised injectable hydromorphone could have physical and mental health benefits and reduce illicit street drug use, potentially making it a viable \u2015 and less stigmatized \u2015 alternative to prescription heroin, with far fewer regulatory hoops.\n\n\u201cThis is a drug already being widely used [in medical settings] in the U.S., so would be simply an incremental adjustment,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. (Although Beletsky was not involved in the report, he did give the authors feedback on it.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more realistic to call for that approach,\u201d he added.\n\nSupervised consumption pilot sites face their own legal obstacles. Although the sites are being considered in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, a federal law known as the \u201ccrack house statute\u201d makes it illegal to use or distribute a controlled substance, and the Justice Department has threatened to crack down on any site that does open.\n\nI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s. Robert Heimer, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health\n\nMany jurisdictions seem skittish about the potential pilots. In October, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation that would have authorized the nation\u2019s first pilot program in San Francisco, although it remains to be seen what will happen when Democratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is sworn in next year.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s, and take some risks,\u201d said Robert Heimer, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.\n\n\u201cThese are as much practical implementations as they are scientific. Sometimes waiting for the science to provide conclusive evidence of anything really means missed opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no compelling evidence against, and there\u2019s logical reasons why these things might be expected to work, then just go with it,\u201d Heimer added.\n\nBut prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites were never intended to work in isolation. Instead, they are potential pieces of a much larger, multipronged approach to addressing the crisis.\n\nWhile a handful of big cities eye supervised consumption sites as an additional tool in their opioid crisis toolbox, much of the country lacks more basic harm reduction services. There are still few needle exchange programs in the U.S., particularly in rural areas of the country, and large gaps in access to addiction treatment.\n\nAs it stands, only 12 percent of people with substance use disorder received speciality treatment, according to a 2016 surgeon general report, despite decades of evidence showing that treatments like methadone and buprenorphine are effective. And even less controversial harm reduction strategies, like needle exchanges and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, still aren\u2019t as widely available as they should be.\n\n\u201cRural counties are at high risk for problems,\u201d but they need more fundamental harm reduction strategies in place before trying to create supervised consumption sites, Heimer said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the cities that are more practical first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasing access to methadone and buprenorphine must remain a top priority,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cIf you are talking about places that don\u2019t have methadone or don\u2019t have syringe exchange programs, I don\u2019t think it would make much sense to argue for these other types of interventions, which could be even more controversial.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

The Times excluded code packages that collect location primarily for mapping, as opposed to the sale or use of the data.\n\nThe Times restricted results to apps that MightySignal had scanned within the previous six months. Many little-used apps on Android include location-gathering code, so The Times filtered out apps with fewer than 5,000 downloads. Because Apple does not provide download figures for its apps, the iOS apps were not sorted by user base.\n\nTallying Location Companies\n\nTimes reporters examined each company identified in the testing. Those that said they didn\u2019t handle precise location data at all, despite having received it, were not counted as part of the location-tracking industry. In these cases, apps may have sent the data to multiple companies and relied on the recipients to delete it if they didn\u2019t want it.\n\nThe Times also did not count companies that were merely processing the data for the app \u2014 for security, for example, or to tell the app maker about its own users.\n\nMany location companies receive data from app makers rather than from the apps themselves, a means of sharing that can\u2019t be detected through testing. So reporters also relied on other sources to identify location companies, including outside analysis of the marketplace, privacy disclosures required under a new European law and interviews with dozens of people affiliated with the industry.\n\nApps Tested\n\nThe apps included in the test are listed below, along with comment from the companies.

The prince and his advisers, eager to enlist American support for his hawkish policies in the region and for his own consolidation of power, cultivated the relationship with Mr. Kushner for more than two years, according to documents, emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nA delegation of Saudis close to the prince visited the United States as early as the month Mr. Trump was elected, the documents show, and brought back a report identifying Mr. Kushner as a crucial focal point in the courtship of the new administration. He brought to the job scant knowledge about the region, a transactional mind-set and an intense focus on reaching a deal with the Palestinians that met Israel\u2019s demands, the delegation noted.\n\nEven then, before the inauguration, the Saudis were trying to position themselves as essential allies who could help the Trump administration fulfill its campaign pledges. In addition to offering to help resolve the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, the Saudis offered hundreds of billions of dollars in deals to buy American weapons and invest in American infrastructure. Mr. Trump later announced versions of some of these items with great fanfare when he made his first foreign trip: to an Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.

The association said it is investigating Dr. Baselga\u2019s actions.\n\nMost authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon.\n\nThe Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley\u2019s behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts.\n\nThe Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a \u201cuniversal disclosure\u201d practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions.\n\n\u201cWe believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,\u201d the center said.\n\nASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris\u2019s disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 \u2014 as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization \u2014 it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019.\n\n\u201cDisclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO\u2019s,\u201d the group said in an email."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The New Old Age: Older Americans Are Flocking to Medical Marijuana", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/health/seniors-marijuana-cannabis-pain.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Shari Horne broke her toes a decade ago, and after surgery, \u201cI have plates and pins and screws in my feet, and they get achy at times,\u201d she said.\n\nSo Ms. Horne, 66, applies a salve containing cannabidiol , derived from the cannabis, or marijuana, plant.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-10 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Tracleer, which is prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, sells in pharmacies for an average cash price of about $14,500 for 60 tablets, according to the website GoodRx.\n\nCaroline Pavis, a spokeswoman for Actelion, said in a statement that the company was committed to complying with the law. It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence \u2014 they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.\n\nBut federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies\u2019 treatments for the pulmonary condition."}]
