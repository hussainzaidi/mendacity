But what the filing did have in common with Mueller's past practice was the sowing of new intrigues, open loops and what have become known as \"breadcrumbs\" that offer tantalizing clues about the direction he is headed.\n\nMueller's filing to a district court in Washington had been seen as a potential window into his tightly held investigation of whether members of Trump's orbit had cooperated with Russia's interference effort in 2016 and another criminal investigation.\n\nIt provided few definitive answers, but its line after line of blacked-out text offered eloquent testimony on the breadth of the Mueller investigation and appears to dispel expectations that he is nearly ready to wrap up. That's because he withheld the most crucial details that would have blown open the case to protect ongoing and future inquiries and potential prosecutions.\n\n\"What I think here is Flynn provided information that is allowing Mueller to make a criminal case against someone,\" Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't know who that is. We can speculate or not speculate. But there is certainly somebody out there who has a criminal case that could be coming,\" he said.\n\nMany of Mueller's previous court filings have embroidered a rich narrative about what he knows about the effort by Moscow's spy agencies to disrupt the presidential election, which eventually developed into a preference for Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a Russia hawk.\n\nMueller has sought to establish that multiple people around the President had contacts with Russians and their sympathizers and were dishonest about those communications.\n\nLast week, Mueller made a case that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was negotiating to build a Trump Tower in Moscow into June 2016 -- long after it was clear that his boss would win the GOP nomination and in contravention of the President's statements that he had no business ties with Russia.\n\nCohen's own lawyers argued in their filings that he had kept Trump up to speed on his contacts, a factor that raised questions about the President's denials that he knew about other links between people in his inner circle and Russia.\n\nA mystery criminal investigation\n\nThe most interesting disclosure was that Flynn had helped with what appears to be at least one separate, unidentified criminal investigation that is distinct from the probe into Russian election interference and any links to Trump's 2016 team.\n\nAll references to that avenue of inquiry were blacked out -- an omission that is likely to spark fierce speculation about what he is referring to and who may be in his sights.\n\nThere was also an unmissable line in the Flynn sentencing memo that will be viewed as a sign that the special counsel is aiming at administration officials who are more senior, even, than a former national security adviser.\n\nHe wrote, while noting Flynn's exemplary military service over a long career, that nevertheless \"senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards.\"\n\nThat hint should certainly worry Trump and his top aides.\n\nThroughout the filing, Mueller stressed the value of Flynn's work in lifting the lid on what had gone on in the Trump campaign and the transition period before he was fired a few weeks into the administration, for what the White House said was lying to Vice President Mike Pence over a telephone conversation in which he had discussed sanctions with Russia's then-ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak.\n\n\"His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the first people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation by the (special counsel's office),\" the memo said.\n\n\"Additionally, the defendant's decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the SCO and cooperate,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nThese remarks cannot be considered outside the context of Trump's Twitter praise for associates such as Roger Stone, who have refused to cooperate with Mueller, and criticism for those such as Cohen, who have agreed to divulge what they know in the hope of reduced sentences.\n\nMueller appears to be sending a message to other witnesses that full disclosure will be rewarded while attempts to thwart him -- for example, by former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whom he has accused of lying in contravention of a cooperation agreement, will be severely punished.\n\nA new challenge for Trump legal team\n\nJUST WATCHED Manafort team briefed Giuliani on Mueller meetings Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Manafort team briefed Giuliani on Mueller meetings 01:21\n\nThere was no immediate reaction to Mueller's filing by Trump or his legal team.\n\nBut it is likely that the President's defenders will use the redacted documents to stick to their consistent line that the special counsel has still yet to offer any conclusive evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nYet given the vast quantity of redacted evidence in Mueller's latest filing, it appears more likely that the special counsel will find -- or already has identified -- evidence to suggest such a conspiracy did take place.\n\nThe documents left unsaid who has the most to fear from Mueller.\n\nBut there were few officials in the Trump campaign who were more influential or closer to the candidate and President-elect himself.\n\nAfter Tuesday's developments, there is certain to be fresh speculation about the potential jeopardy of key figures including Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe Flynn sentencing memo is not the only shoe to drop this week. On Friday, the special counsel is due to explain in another court filing why he believes that Manafort has lied to his investigators -- behavior that he contends should end a court-mandated cooperation agreement with the former uber lobbyist."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Mueller asks for no prison time for Michael Flynn", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/HhsNgFrSIZk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller told a federal court Tuesday that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn has given \"substantial assistance\" to the Russia investigation and should not get jail time.\n\nFlynn has sat for 19 interviews with the special counsel and other Justice Department offices, and his early cooperation gave prosecutors a road map for their Russia investigation and may have helped to encourage others to cooperate, the filing states.\n\nThe new details explaining how Flynn has helped the special counsel investigation will ratchet up the pressure on President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the Mueller probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nLast week, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his work on the proposed Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 campaign and prosecutors accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of violating his cooperation agreement by lying to the special counsel.\n\nTuesday's memo appears to list at least three ongoing investigations being pursued by the Justice Department. The details of two of them are redacted. The special counsel's office says Flynn cooperated with the investigation into links or coordination between the Russian government and members of Trump's team.\n\nMeet the Mueller team Special counsel Robert Mueller assembled a team of at least 17 lawyers for his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMueller's office says Flynn assisted it \"on a range of issues, including interactions between individuals in the Presidential Transition Team and Russia.\" The rest of the sentence-long description of how Flynn helped in the Russian interference investigation is redacted.\n\n'Early cooperation' was helpful, Mueller says\n\nAccording to Mueller's filing, Flynn has been helping investigators longer and on more Justice Department probes than had been previously known. The sheer amount of redacted text in the filing suggests those details are not ready to be unveiled, signaling that Mueller's investigation continues, along with other investigations that Flynn helped with.\n\nFlynn began cooperating with the Russia probe \"shortly after\" Mueller's team approached him, prosecutors said -- and that early cooperation boosted investigators' understanding of what happened during the campaign.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators on December 1, 2017, becoming the first high-ranking Trump adviser to agree to formally cooperate with the special counsel's probe.\n\n\"His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the first people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation,\" the memo states.\n\n\"Additionally, the defendant's decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the (special counsel's office) and cooperate,\" prosecutors wrote, making clear they used Flynn as their entry point into understanding the campaign and transition.\n\nFlynn is at the center of what's believed to be an investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. He has also been scrutinized by the intelligence community, and likely Mueller, for his contacts with high-ranking Russians before and during his short time in the administration.\n\nHe was a close adviser to Trump during the campaign -- and famously led a \"lock her up\" Hillary Clinton chant at the Republican National Convention.\n\nFlynn served as Trump's national security adviser for less than a month in early 2017, then was fired more than two weeks after then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates told White House officials that Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications on Russian sanctions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. At the time, the intelligence community was concerned the Russians could blackmail Flynn.\n\nAround that time, Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to let the Flynn investigation go, Comey has said.\n\nMost lenient sentencing recommendation\n\nFlynn is scheduled to be sentenced December 18 by federal Judge Emmet Sullivan in DC federal court.\n\nDespite the number of criminally charged lies he admitted to and his high rank in the Trump administration, Flynn earned the most lenient recommendation before his sentencing from the special counsel's office so far.\n\nPreviously, Mueller's office has told judges that the defendants they cut deals with did not help them as extensively. Three other defendants in the Mueller probe have been sentenced. They were internet fake ID salesman Richard Pinedo, who is currently serving six months in prison in California even after he helped Mueller track down a Russian social media propaganda scheme; George Papadopoulos, who's finishing a two-week prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with foreigners while he was a Trump campaign adviser; and Dutch lawyer Alex Van der Zwaan, who served about a month in prison after he lied about his communications following a Ukrainian lobbying project.\n\nNeither Papadopoulos nor Van der Zwaan gave any substantial help to the Mueller investigation, prosecutors said at their sentencings.\n\n'Senior members' of transition team repeated lies, Mueller says\n\nIn the filing Tuesday night, Mueller's prosecutors said \"senior members\" of the Trump transition repeated lies that they had been told by Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador in late 2016.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by (Flynn) about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" the filing states.\n\nThat sentence is followed by three-and-a-half lines of redacted information. Mueller's team told the judge it needed to redact information in the six-page memo because it contains \"sensitive information about ongoing investigations.\"\n\nIn addition to lying to federal investigators about discussing sanctions with Kislyak, Mueller's filing states that Flynn lied about interactions with Russians over a United Nations Security Council resolution involving Israeli settlements.\n\nFlynn also made false statements to the Justice Department, the filing states, in his March 2017 foreign lobbying filing about his work in Turkey -- including failing to disclose his ties to the Turkish government when he wrote a November 2016 op-ed calling for the removal of a cleric residing in the US.\n\nMueller's office said Flynn's lengthy military and public service record should have made him \"particularly aware\" of the harm of lying to the government.\n\nThe filing states: \"Senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Jeffrey Toobin: I'd be nervous if I were Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/2bNPSsoCutk/michael-flynn-mueller-cooperation-toobin-trump-worried-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

At least a dozen children in Sweden, the United States and Serbia have been born to women with transplanted uteri donated by a living relative, noted the authors of the study , which was published Tuesday in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\n\"The results provide proof-of-concept for a new treatment option for absolute uterine factor infertility,\" wrote co-authors Dr. Dani Ejzenberg, an ob/gyn at the University of Sao Paulo and Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas in Brazil, and Dr. Wellington Andraus, a transplant surgeon at the Sao Paulo University School of Medicine in the study. Less than 5% of women worldwide have some type of \"absolute uterine factor infertility,\" in which an abnormality of the womb interferes with fetal development.\n\nThe Brazilian team followed protocols established by Dr. Mats Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m and his team at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, where the first successful uterus transplant, that one from a living donor, was performed in 2013. That recipient mother gave birth in 2014.\n\nFrom transplant to birth\n\nfor published case studies.) Her diagnosis: The transplant recipient, who had been born without a uterus, was 32 years old at the time of the surgery in September 2016. (The patient's identity remains anonymous, which is typicalfor published case studies.)Her diagnosis: Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome , a genetic condition that affects one in 4,500 women and causes a patient's vagina and uterus to be either absent or underdeveloped, although her external genitals appear normal and her ovaries still function and contain eggs.\n\nMonths before receiving a uterus transplant, the patient underwent in-vitro fertilization. This resulted in eight good-quality early-stage embryos, which were cryopreserved in the hopes of being used after a uterus transplant.\n\nThe donor, a 45-year-old woman who died of a stroke, was deemed a good candidate because she had had three vaginal deliveries during her life, she had no reported sexual disease and her blood type, O-positive, matched that of the recipient.\n\nThe procedure to transfer the uterus from donor to recipient lasted more than 10 hours. The surgery involved connecting the recipient's veins and arteries, ligaments and vaginal canals with the donated uterus. For eight days, the recipient remained in the hospital, where she received five immunosuppression drugs, which control the body's natural instinct to fight off and reject a transplanted organ.\n\nFive months after the transplant, the recipient showed no signs of rejecting the uterus, and for the first time in her life, she experienced menstruation. Ultrasound scans also showed no abnormalities.\n\nAfter seven months of cautious watching and waiting, doctors implanted a single fertilized egg, though in previous uterus transplants, doctors waited a full year to implant. The shorter timetable was intended to reduce patient expenses and risk, because the possibility of the body rejecting an organ can increase over time.\n\nPregnancy was confirmed 10 days later. Throughout the pregnancy, all the usual tests showed a normal fetus with no anomalies. Other than a kidney infection treated with antibiotics at 32 weeks, the mother had no issues during her pregnancy and continued her immunosuppression regimen to prevent rejection of the implanted womb.\n\nA girl weighing nearly 6 pounds was born on December 15, 2017, at 35 weeks and three days -- a late pre-term birth. Ejzenberg and Andraus said Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m's group \"recommended delivery between 34 and 36 weeks due to the risk of restriction of fetal growth due to immunosuppressive therapy.\"\n\nA sonogram shows the baby developing normally within the transplanted uterus.\n\nThe mother delivered via c-section, which included a removal of the transplanted uterus so she could stop using immunosupressive drugs, according to Ejzenberg and Andraus. The organ showed no evidence of rejection, only the usual changes that occur during pregnancy. Both mother and child were discharged from the hospital three days later.\n\nAt the age of 7 months and 20 days when the case study was written, the baby continued to breastfeed and weighed nearly 16 pounds.\n\nThe baby will celebrate her first birthday within two weeks, Ejzenberg and Andraus said. Mother and child have experienced no complications or abnormalities.\n\nThis birth is the first uterus transplant of any kind performed in Latin America and the first using a cadaver organ. Previous attempts at using a cadaver uterus have not resulted in a live birth.\n\nEjzenberg and Andraus said their team's success \"brings hope to other centers that believe in this type of transplant and that have not been successful until [this] moment. It is also a source of hope for patients who do not have a family member or close friend to donate the uterus.\"\n\nWhy this is unique\n\nDr. Andrew Shennan, a professor of obstetrics at Kings College London, told the Science Media Centre that what is unique about this case is that the pregnancy occurred \"in spite of the uterus (womb) being without oxygen for 8 hours before transplant.\" In fact, the new study proves that it could remain functional after cold, oxygen-less storage at least four times as long as the average time after live donation: nearly eight hours, versus less than than two.\n\nShennan, who was not involved in either the transplant or the birth, added that this case \"opens the possibility of women donating their womb following death, as with many other organs.\" And \"rather than relying on live donors, a surrogate or adoption,\" women who are infertile due to uterine factor infertility might soon have another option.\n\nhave occurred in Europe (Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, and Serbia), they have also been done in Asia, the Middle East and North America. He added that 53 of the transplants involved women born with no uterus. Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m wrote in an email that \"56 uterine transplant procedures have been performed worldwide,\" and although halfhave occurred in Europe (Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, and Serbia), they have also been done in Asia, the Middle East and North America. He added that 53 of the transplants involved women born with no uterus.\n\nThese transplants have yielded \"13 babies born worldwide\" via uterus transplants, including the birth documented in the new case study, Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m said. His own team conducted a series of transplants in multiple women resulting in several live births.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThough the success of uterus transplants has been proven, Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m said, \"it is important that it also works with a deceased donor, with longer ischemic time and less time to investigate the organ.\" Ischemic time is the amount of time a donated organ remains chilled and without blood flow. The technique still needs to be \"replicated by several teams around the globe\" for further validation, he said.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine recognizes uterus transplantation as a \"successful medical treatment of absolute uterus factor infertility\" yet cautions that the procedure is still \"highly experimental\" in nature. At the time they wrote the study, the authors recorded 10 cadaver uterus transplants attempted or underway in the United States, Turkey and the Czech Republic.\n\nBr\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m, though, feels hopeful and believes that future transplants will not only create new life, they will \"greatly increase the quality of life for parents and grandparents.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US senator: Saudi crown prince 'ordered, monitored' killing of Khashoggi", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/NTPPGnwJfQ4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Republican senators reacted with outrage Tuesday after leaving a classified briefing about the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, promising swift action to confront both Saudi Arabia and the White House's timid response to the killing.\n\nGOP Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are leading the charge to offer new legislation that would rebuke Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as potentially limit US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, saying their push was bolstered by the classified briefing, which detailed intelligence linking the Saudi leader to the murder of the US-based journalist.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" said Graham, referring to reports that the Saudi team had included a forensic expert who arrived with equipment to dismember Khashoggi's body.\n\nReferring to the prince, who is known by his initials, Graham said, \"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MBS and that he was intrinsically involved in the demise of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\n'Ordered, monitored'\n\nCorker added that the prince \"ordered, monitored, the killing\" of the father of four.\n\n\"If he were in front of a jury, he would be convicted of murder in about 30 minutes,\" Corker said.\n\nThe strong comments are the latest development in a controversy that has been building over the last two months as the Saudis have offered changing explanations about the disappearance and murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2.\n\nTrump has made a concerted decision to avoid rebuking Saudi Arabia, claiming the kingdom's role in affecting global oil prices and its arms deals with the United States are more important to the national interest.\n\nTrump, as well as Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have downplayed the crown prince's ties to the murder, with Pompeo saying there was no \"direct evidence\" linking him to Khashoggi's death.\n\nNo doubt, senators say\n\n\"Maybe he did and maybe he didn't,\" Trump said last month about whether the crown prince had known about the murder.\n\nBut senator after senator leaving the CIA briefing said there's no doubt that bin Salman was involved, adding that the United States cannot ignore the matter.\n\n\"Somebody should be punished,\" said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama. \"Now, the question is how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation itself? That might be the real policy question.\"\n\nIndeed, after Haspel's briefing, the groundswell of certainty and disgust will likely complicate the administration's efforts to protect the prince and its relationship with Saudi Arabia, even as lawmakers have yet to coalesce around a legislative response.\n\n'It's time'\n\nAmong the options: pull back from US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen; deny any arms sales with Saudi Arabia; slap the crown prince with sanctions, along with a resolution saying the Senate finds him complicit in murder. How the legislative push gets resolved is uncertain, but the floor fight could begin as soon as Monday -- and put the administration on the defensive.\n\n\"It's time for the United States to be out of that war,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat Connecticut who co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution calling for an end to the US role in Yemen. \"I know there are going to be a lot of efforts to try to remove the underlying language and replace it with something weaker. I don't think that ultimately saves lives in the way that the underlying bill does.\"\n\nCorker said he's not certain he would support pulling back from Yemen but that \"I deserve the right\" to back a withdrawal of US involvement in the war effort.\n\n\"I don't want to do anything to harm our national interest, and I don't think that we've fully spoken to what the crown prince has done,\" Corker told CNN. \"There are a lot of issues with Yemen that need to be addressed.\"\n\n'Deep state' concerns\n\nThe CIA, meanwhile, is facing growing pressure to brief the full Senate, since Tuesday's briefing comprised only roughly a dozen senators from the party leadership and who sit on key committees.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, railed at the \"deep state\" for limiting the information flow to senators, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded the full Senate be briefed as soon as possible.\n\n\"While I will not discuss the content of the Haspel briefing, it reinforced the need for a strong response to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\" the New York Democrat said. \"CIA Director Haspel should brief the full Senate without delay.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement that \"every Senator should hear what I heard this afternoon. CIA Director Haspel must brief the full Senate immediately.\"\n\nAnd Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican who was not part of the briefing, said that \"by the director choosing to meet with some, but not others, congratulations to her, she has pissed off everybody.\"\n\nHigh confidence\n\nThe office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has not responded to a request for comment on whether Haspel should brief the full chamber.\n\nHaspel herself did not respond to CNN's questions as she left the briefing about whether it would satisfy senators' concerns.\n\nThe CIA had already concluded with high confidence that the prince was behind the murder, but senators said Haspel provided a much more fulsome briefing than the one they had gotten from Cabinet officials, including new evidence.\n\n\"Oh, there was much more information,\" Durbin said. \"I went in believing the crown prince was directly responsible or at least complicit in this and my feeling was strengthened by the information.\"\n\n'Yes'\n\nAsked if the prince is responsible for Khashoggi's death, Durbin answered with one word: \"Yes.\"\n\nGraham said the United States should come down like a \"ton of bricks\" on the Saudis, adding that he can no longer do business with Saudi Arabia and \"cannot support arm sales to Saudi Arabia\" if the \"crazy\" crown prince is still running the country.\n\nSome senators emphasized the need to find a balanced response. \"We have to figure out a way to condemn the butchery and the murder in the strongest possible terms without blowing up the Middle East,\" Kennedy said. \"That's what the Senate needs help on, and I am open to all suggestions on how to do that.\"\n\nOthers tried to downplay Haspel's briefing. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told CNN that Haspel should not come back and brief the whole Senate as senators on both sides have demanded.\n\n\"She didn't tell them anything that (Mattis and Pompeo didn't say),\" the Texas Republican said, \"so any senator who wants the information has had access to it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Mexico's new president is selling his version of Air Force One and flying commercial", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/p0ZKlBOnLzM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Can you imagine boarding a commercial flight and finding out the person sitting next to you is the President of Mexico?

With only 16 weeks to go before the Article 50 deadline on March 29, options are running out if parliament rejects Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal.\n\nHere's a statement from me on the Advocate General's Opinion in the Article 50 case, in which I am a petitioner. pic.twitter.com/WkOKWqlDB7 \u2014 Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) December 4, 2018\n\nThe advocate general's opinion comes in a case originally brought in Scotland by a cross-party group of anti-Brexit campaigners, led by Andy Wightman, a Scottish Green Party lawmaker in the Scottish Parliament. Scotland's top court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh, had referred it to Strasbourg for a ruling.\n\nThe case was fiercely opposed by the British government, which unsuccessfully argued that the Supreme Court in London should intervene before it went to Europe.\n\nMay told her Cabinet Tuesday that Brexit would not be reversed, a spokesman said. May stressed that the advocate general's findings were not binding on the court.\n\nJolyon Maugham, one of the petitioners in the case, welcomed the advocate general's opinion, urging UK lawmakers to \"search their consciences and act in the best interests of the country.\"\n\n\"The decision is one that the UK can make unilaterally -- without needing the consent of the other Member States. That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives -- where it belongs,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nConservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general and second referendum supporter, told the BBC the decision by the advocate general was \"clearly significant.\"\n\n\"Of course it doesn't necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.\"\n\nAsked whether the decision could lead to a second referendum on EU membership, he added: \"It is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments which is 'Oh well, they would never allow us to change our minds'.\"\n\nIn his opinion, Sanchez-Bordona said the possibility of the UK unilaterally revoking Article 50 would be subject to \"certain conditions and limits.\" He noted that it must \"respect national constitutional requirements,\" and that would likely mean a vote in the UK parliament.\n\nECJ justices are expected to decide whether to accept the legal advice in the coming weeks. After that, the case will be referred back to the Court of Session in Edinburgh for a final ruling.\n\nThe decision came on the day that Theresa May begins her quest to sell the Brexit deal to lawmakers in the House of Commons.\n\nMPs will spend the next five days debating the deal before a vote next Tuesday, which May is widely expected to lose.\n\nBefore Tuesday's debate begins, May could face another setback, when MPs vote on whether her government should be held in contempt of parliament for failing to publish the full legal advice on her deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Israel begins operation to 'expose and thwart' Hezbollah tunnels", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/I5iiWqEAPFk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Jerusalem (CNN) Israel has launched an operation along its northern border with Lebanon to \"expose and thwart cross border tunnels\" which it says have been dug by Hezbollah, the Israeli army said on Tuesday.\n\nHours after announcing the operation, Israel's military said it had begun work to neutralize such a tunnel near the Israeli town of Metula, which sits right along the border.

The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is rheumatoid arthritis? 03:24\n\nOak has been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and his care team plans to discuss his health with experts at the University of Florida to better understand his medical problem and needs.\n\n\"The kind of disease that this guy has, it flares up, and he obviously has discomfort and some pain associated with it. It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"There's still much more work to be done to stop the government's monkey business in labs at the FDA and other agencies.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs music hour at Jungle Friends wound down on Wednesday, The Youngbloods crooned, \"Come on people now, smile on your brother.\"\n\nPoppit and Pixel hopped over each other from one end of their cage to the other.

The sheer amount of redacted text in the filing suggests those details are not ready to be unveiled, signaling that Mueller's investigation continues, along with other investigations that Flynn helped with.\n\nFlynn began cooperating with the Russia probe \"shortly after\" Mueller's team approached him, prosecutors said -- and that early cooperation boosted investigators' understanding of what happened during the campaign.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators on December 1, 2017, becoming the first high-ranking Trump adviser to agree to formally cooperate with the special counsel's probe.\n\n\"His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the first people with long-term and firsthand insight regarding events and issues under investigation,\" the memo states.\n\n\"Additionally, the defendant's decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming with the (special counsel's office) and cooperate,\" prosecutors wrote, making clear they used Flynn as their entry point into understanding the campaign and transition.\n\nFlynn is at the center of what's believed to be an investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. He has also been scrutinized by the intelligence community, and likely Mueller, for his contacts with high-ranking Russians before and during his short time in the administration.\n\nHe was a close adviser to Trump during the campaign -- and famously led a \"lock her up\" Hillary Clinton chant at the Republican National Convention.\n\nFlynn served as Trump's national security adviser for less than a month in early 2017, then was fired more than two weeks after then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates told White House officials that Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications on Russian sanctions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. At the time, the intelligence community was concerned the Russians could blackmail Flynn.\n\nAround that time, Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to let the Flynn investigation go, Comey has said.\n\nMost lenient sentencing recommendation\n\nFlynn is scheduled to be sentenced December 18 by federal Judge Emmet Sullivan in DC federal court.\n\nDespite the number of criminally charged lies he admitted to and his high rank in the Trump administration, Flynn earned the most lenient recommendation before his sentencing from the special counsel's office so far.\n\nPreviously, Mueller's office has told judges that the defendants they cut deals with did not help them as extensively. Three other defendants in the Mueller probe have been sentenced. They were internet fake ID salesman Richard Pinedo, who is currently serving six months in prison in California even after he helped Mueller track down a Russian social media propaganda scheme; George Papadopoulos, who's finishing a two-week prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with foreigners while he was a Trump campaign adviser; and Dutch lawyer Alex Van der Zwaan, who served about a month in prison after he lied about his communications following a Ukrainian lobbying project.\n\nNeither Papadopoulos nor Van der Zwaan gave any substantial help to the Mueller investigation, prosecutors said at their sentencings.\n\n'Senior members' of transition team repeated lies, Mueller says\n\nIn the filing Tuesday night, Mueller's prosecutors said \"senior members\" of the Trump transition repeated lies that they had been told by Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador in late 2016.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by (Flynn) about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" the filing states.\n\nThat sentence is followed by three-and-a-half lines of redacted information. Mueller's team told the judge it needed to redact information in the six-page memo because it contains \"sensitive information about ongoing investigations.\"\n\nIn addition to lying to federal investigators about discussing sanctions with Kislyak, Mueller's filing states that Flynn lied about interactions with Russians over a United Nations Security Council resolution involving Israeli settlements.\n\nFlynn also made false statements to the Justice Department, the filing states, in his March 2017 foreign lobbying filing about his work in Turkey -- including failing to disclose his ties to the Turkish government when he wrote a November 2016 op-ed calling for the removal of a cleric residing in the US.\n\nMueller's office said Flynn's lengthy military and public service record should have made him \"particularly aware\" of the harm of lying to the government.\n\nThe filing states: \"Senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Mueller says Flynn provided 'substantial' assistance", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nabEk-hmUeA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

There were about three to each large cage.\n\nPoppit and Pixel jumped over each other when Kari passed by. Gizmo looked up with wide eyes. Pip let out a tiny chirp.\n\nThen there was Oak. Despite pain from rheumatoid arthritis, his energy was about as high as the others'.\n\nBagnall stopped interacting with the other monkeys to look directly at him. She squinted, homed in on his hands and then shifted her shoulders back with satisfaction.\n\n\"He looks good,\" she said.\n\nOak and the other monkeys arrived in mid-November at Jungle Friends, this primate sanctuary in Gainesville where Bagnall serves as founder and director\n\nThe monkeys were once involved in a US Food and Drug Administration study intended to investigate the role of various levels of nicotine in the onset of addiction in teens and young adults.\n\nIn January, after the deaths of four monkeys involved in the research drew criticism from some animal rights activists, the agency ended the study. The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is rheumatoid arthritis? 03:24\n\nOak has been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, and his care team plans to discuss his health with experts at the University of Florida to better understand his medical problem and needs.\n\n\"The kind of disease that this guy has, it flares up, and he obviously has discomfort and some pain associated with it. It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"There's still much more work to be done to stop the government's monkey business in labs at the FDA and other agencies.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs music hour at Jungle Friends wound down on Wednesday, The Youngbloods crooned, \"Come on people now, smile on your brother.\"\n\nPoppit and Pixel hopped over each other from one end of their cage to the other.

While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.\n\nBut that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.\n\nEven on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.\n\nThen, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.\n\nOlivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.\n\nThe members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.\n\nAFM and polio: eerie similarities\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPolio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, according to the CDC . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.\n\nThanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been polio free since 1979 , according to the CDC.\n\nBut there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.\n\nSome have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAfter the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.\n\nThe socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.\n\n\"That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight,\" she said. \"They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Polio-like illness AFM 'appears to have peaked' in US for the year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ytQMolddxHw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The number of cases of the polio-like illness acute flaccid myelitis \"appears to have peaked\" for 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.\n\nIn its weekly update on cases of the illness, the agency said there have been 134 confirmed cases in 33 states this year.

The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi.\n\n\"I'm free here,\" she said.\n\n'If you know any gays, report them to me'\n\nMakonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country, forcing many into hiding.\n\nStating that his phone number is widely known, \"I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays, report them to me,\" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.\n\nPaul Makonda, a politician in Tanzania, launched an anti-gay crackdown, threatening to arrest people suspected of being homosexuals.\n\nPeople already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said. There needs to be more peer-led outreach and services, as government services will not reach vulnerable people in such political climates.\n\nTanzania's Ministry of Health and a government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'They are making us fear, like we are not human beings'\n\nPeople involved in peer programs in Tanzania risk abuse but believe that in their work to help and educate people about the importance of HIV prevention as well as living with the condition, in addition to ensuring that they know their rights -- keeping them out of prison and away from the risk of infection.\n\n\"People are not free,\" said Faki, whose name has been changed to ensure his safety. The government is \"making us fear, like we are not human beings.\"\n\nFaki has been openly homosexual for just a few years, having gained the courage to come out through attending training and information sessions with local community groups.\n\nTwo years ago, he and two fellow activists formed an organization to work primarily with LGBT groups on his home island of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam, he says, his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police. His work has gotten him arrested too, he said.\n\n\"We have no support anymore,\" he said.\n\n, Faki helped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while Just a few days after Makonda's announcement for local task forces in Dar es SalaamFakihelped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while on local Pongwe beach , he said. They were reported by the driver who took them there. Amnesty International also reported the arrests.\n\nAt the same time, Faki had another LGBT friend come to stay with him, in hiding from Dar es Salaam, he said.\n\nThough his goal in life is to make LGBT people aware of their rights to make them confident about their sexuality in public and in the face of aggressive law enforcement, he also worries about the health of this community.\n\nAccess is a core issue, and another prohibitive factor is the attitude of health care workers at clinics, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf people find out you're gay, they're not friendly, he said, adding that if people do go to clinics for care, they can't be free and explain themselves or their situation, causing extra problems and \"contributing to the spread of HIV.\"\n\nHe is not hopeful about his island's or country's future.\n\nGlobal outcry in response to Mankonda's announcement has calmed the situation somewhat in Dar es Salaam and nationwide, but not entirely.\n\n\"People don't want to change their mindset on this issue,\" Faki said, referring mainly to government leaders.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J. Phillip King, a professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate.\n\nThe federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100.\n\nnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToday, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. Studies have found that treated water is, in fact, less likely to have contaminants than untreated river or lake water.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEfforts by other municipalities in Texas and California to use \"direct potable reuse\" haven't always gotten off the ground because of the \"ickiness\" factor. Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink. Water really is all around us in every city.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit debate: Ministers fight for Theresa May's deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46450227", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit\n\nMinisters will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's Brexit deal later, a day after the government suffered three defeats on key votes.\n\nSecurity will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours.\n\nCrucially, MPs backed calls to give them a direct say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is rejected next week.\n\nA former Tory chief whip has told the BBC he expects the PM to lose the vote.\n\nMark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendum told the Daily Telegraph he would vote against the withdrawal agreement, and predicted the deal would be rejected by 80 of his party colleagues.\n\nThe deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force.

The other part could cause Donald Trump and those close to him sleepless nights in the days ahead.\n\nIn an addendum to the sentencing memo, Robert Mueller details the help Mr Flynn provided to his investigation in exchange for a lenient sentence.\n\nSome of it is old news. The former national security advisor told Mr Mueller \"first-hand\" about his communications with Russians after Mr Trump's election - and similar communications by others in the transition team.\n\nBuried beneath thick black lines below this \"useful information\" is an entire section on further help Mr Flynn provided to Mr Mueller's collusion investigation. Even the subhead appears to be redacted.\n\nThen there's a mysterious \"criminal investigation\" to which Mr Flynn provided \"substantial assistance\". That portion of the memo, without a few introductory words, is entirely redacted. Who is being investigated? And what type of criminal wrongdoing is suspected?\n\nThe Flynn document raises as many questions as it answers - and points toward explosive revelations to come.\n\nWho is Michael Flynn?\n\nHe had been a fervent supporter of Mr Trump during the election campaign and was appointed Mr Trump's national security adviser even though former President Barack Obama had warned against the appointment.\n\nIt was a short tenure, ending in February 2017 after just 23 days, his departure forced by the revelation he had lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about the discussion with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\n\nFurther allegations then arose over a failure to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work.\n\nThe retired US Army three-star lieutenant-general had earlier led the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) but was fired, on the surface for comments about Islamist extremism, although insiders also pointed to his unpopular overhaul of the agency.\n\nHave others pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe?\n\nYes, although not on charges related to collusion with Russia.\n\nMr Trump's former deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators.\n\nFormer campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been convicted for fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. He has a plea bargain deal but has been accused of breaching it by lying to the FBI.\n\nEx-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has admitted he lied about a Trump property deal in Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nMore on Trump and Russia"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "China-US trade: China vows speedy action on trade commitments", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46449929", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:22", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nChinese officials have said they are \"confident in implementing\" trade commitments made to the US \"as soon as possible\", without giving details.\n\nAn ongoing trade war has seen both countries impose duties on billions of dollars of one another's goods.\n\nOver the weekend, a temporary truce was agreed between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Argentina.\n\nBut concerns linger over discrepancies in information coming from either side.\n\nThe US and China paused hostilities after several months of tit-for-tat tariffs, agreeing to halt any new duties for 90 days.\n\nThis prevented a widely expected escalation in the trade war.

Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP\n\nA cross-party group of politicians and campaigners including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler brought the case together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.\n\nThey initially took it to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which ultimately agreed to pass it to the ECJ.\n\nTwo attempts by the UK government to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected, and the case was opposed by the government and the EU institutions in a hearing before all 27 ECJ judges last week.\n\nHubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could create \"endless uncertainty\" by allowing countries to announce they are leaving the EU in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal.\n\nThe UK government's lawyers argued that the case was purely hypothetical as \"the UK does not intend to revoke its notification\", and ECJ judges should therefore refuse to rule on it.\n\nThey added that the politicians behind the case wanted to use it as \"political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK parliament\".\n\nAnalysis by Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent\n\nThe advocate general's opinion that the UK has the right to unilaterally withdraw Article 50 notification of its intention to leave the EU flies in the face of what the UK government and the EU want.\n\nAlthough the Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, the ECJ follow his opinions in the majority of cases.\n\nThe whole issue of revocation remains hypothetical at present because the government has made it clear there is no possibility of seeking to revoke the notice to leave the EU.\n\nHowever, the statement raises the question of how the UK might revoke notification.\n\nIt would almost certainly need to be done by an act of parliament. If it was done by ministers alone using prerogative powers it would frustrate the will of parliament as expressed in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n\nIt should be noted that the statement and the case concerns revocation of notice to leave, and not a delay or extension of the two-year period provided for under Article 50.\n\nThat period can be extended, but only with the agreement of all of the other 27 EU states. Whereas extension of the Article 50 period could become a political necessity, revocation of Article 50 remains something of an academic point at present. However, that would change if there was a second referendum in which the British people voted to remain in the EU."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "First baby born after deceased womb transplant", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46438396", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:00:43", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA healthy baby girl has been born using a womb transplanted from a dead body.\n\nThe 10-hour transplant operation - and later fertility treatment - took place in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in 2016.

Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change.\n\n\"If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\"\n\nThe naturalist is taking up the \"People's Seat\" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting.\n\n\"The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already \"a matter of life and death\" for many countries.\n\nHe explained that the world is \"nowhere near where it needs to be\" on the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nBut the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to \"right the ship\" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal'\n\nWhat's so different about this meeting?\n\nThis Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October.\n\nThe IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030.\n\nBut a recent study showed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action.\n\nThey say \"decisive action in the next two years will be crucial\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nMeanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider.\n\nSo urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start.\n\nWill global leaders be attending?\n\nYes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting.\n\nThe number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment.\n\nBut for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nSo will cutting carbon be the main focus of the meeting?\n\nRather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work.\n\nImage copyright FABRICE COFFRINI Image caption A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland\n\nWhile the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020.\n\nBefore then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided.\n\n\"The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,\" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G.\n\n\"It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!\"\n\nRight now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute.\n\nBut what about limiting emissions?\n\nUnder the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action.\n\n\"We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,\" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF.\n\n\"Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast.\"\n\nWhy is the UN process slow-moving?\n\nThere is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians.\n\nImage copyright HANNA FRANZEN Image caption Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24\n\n\"Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues.\n\n\"Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture.\"\n\nOthers involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world.\n\n\"We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nHow much of a role will money play in making progress in Poland?\n\nMany developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nSome are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting.\n\n\"A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\nAre there concerns the meeting is in a country reliant on coal?\n\nYes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many.\n\nThe Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia.\n\nThis bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.\n\nWill President Trump and the US feature at all?\n\nAlthough the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24.\n\nHowever, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels. A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Gina Haspel Briefs Senators On Saudis\u2019 \u2018Shockingly Uninspired\u2019 Khashoggi Interrogation", "article_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/gina-haspel-briefs-senators-on-saudis-shockingly-unin-1830864371", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON\u2014Describing the international incident as a run-of-the-mill violation of human rights, CIA director Gina Haspel briefed senators Tuesday on the \u201cshockingly uninspired\u201d techniques employed by Saudi government agents during the interrogation of Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cUnfortunately, all evidence indicates that Khashoggi was killed after only three or four hours of merciless beatings,\u201d said Haspel in a damning summary of the Saudi death squad\u2019s \u201crelatively tame\u201d treatment of the dissident journalist, adding that the group repeatedly missed out on opportunities for innovative torture. \u201cThe bone saw was a nice touch, I guess, but all of our findings suggest that he was already dead before they even started dismembering him.

Instead, a number of them resigned from the party and voted in favour of it.\n\n\n\nNidaa Tounes, Arabic for the \"Call of Tunisia\", has seen almost half of its 86 MPs defect since 2014, several of them joining rival factions, feeding speculation that the collapse of the ruling party is imminent.\n\n\n\nBut Nidaa Tounes has been breaking apart in ways that analysts have been predicting for the past six years.\n\n'It's not a party'\n\nNidaa Tounes' state of \"fragmentation\" today was \"expected, and will only continue,\" Jomai Gasmi, a Tunisian political analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\nFounded in 2012 by President Essebsi, Nidaa Tounes is a self-styled big tent \"secularist\" party that patched together diverse actors, including wealthy businessmen, progressive liberals, secular leftists, trade unionists, and even former regime members.\n\n\n\nThe varying party members shared no coherent political ideology or vision for the country's ailing economy. Instead, what bound them together was the common objective of curbing the dominance of the then-ruling party, Ennahda, over the political and public spheres, explained Gasmi.\n\n\n\nThe conservative Ennahda party ruled in a tripartite coalition government with two secular parties, dubbed the \"Troika,\" roughly from 2011 to 2014. In this transitional period, Tunisia was rocked by the assassination of two opposition leaders and saw hundreds of youth joining armed groups, while the country continued to struggle with the same economic issues that catalysed the 2011 revolution.\n\n160524094550153\n\nCaricaturing Ennahda as uncultured and retrogressive, Nidaa Tounes held it single-handedly responsible for the country's woes.\n\n\n\nNidaa Tounes would go on to win a plurality in the October 2014 legislative elections, securing 86 out of a total 217 parliamentary seats. Ennahda came in second with 69 seats. A month later, Nidaa's founder, Essebsi, would win the presidency.\n\n\n\nThe legislative and presidential elections marked the end of Tunisia's transition period.\n\n\n\nBranding itself as the \"national modernist and democratic\" alternative, Nidaa Tounes secured a \"strategic vote\" against Ennahda, said Gasmi.\n\n\n\nStructural and ideological unity is the defining factor a political party's sustainability relies upon, something Nidaa Tounes lacked from the beginning, he explained.\n\n\n\n\"This movement did not evolve into a [political] party,\" he said. \"I can't call it a party.\"\n\nCracks within the party\n\nIt didn't take long for the cracks within Tunisia's new ruling party to begin to emerge. Its founder, now president of the republic, Essebsi could no longer continue as the head of the party.\n\n\n\nThat is when \"the first disagreements within the party began... triggering the conflict over his [Essebsi] legacy,\" said Julius Dihstelhoff, a research fellow at the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies.\n\n\n\nToday's crisis is a \"mirror of this struggle for Essebsi's succession,\" Dihstelhoff added.\n\n\n\nOnce a close advisor of Tunisia's founding father, Habib Bourguiba, and a veteran of the country's struggle for independence, Essebsi was seen by supporters and party members alike as the \"old wolf\" statesman capable of modernising the country and bridging its political divide.\n\n\n\nLeft to its own devices, Nidaa Tounes witnessed a leadership crisis that pitted the president's son and party heir, Hafedh, and his supporters, against those who opposed a perceived attempt of hereditary transfer of power and return to autocratic rule.\n\n\n\nThe internal dispute over leadership split Nidaa Tounes into two opposing camps - their approaches were so irreconcilable that violent brawls began to break out in party meetings.\n\n\n\nBy 2015, dozens of party members had resigned, including leading figure Mohsen Marzouk, who went on to form his own party: Mashrou' Tounes, or the \"Tunisia Project\".\n\n\n\nMarzouk, who formerly served as Nidaa's secretary general, said he took issue with Hafedh's sudden rise to power, telling French newspaper Le Monde at the time that there was an attempt to empower a certain individual in the party for no other reason than his name.\n\n\n\nThe schism over the party's internal structure and appointments was further exacerbated by another key dispute over its political direction.\n\n\n\nNidaa Tounes had to make a decisive choice: either enter a coalition government with its rival, Ennahda, which became the largest bloc in parliament following the resignations of dozens of Nidaa Tounes MPs, or form a coalition with opposition forces.\n\n\n\nThe camp supporting the president's son, mainly made up of the old regime, argued that rejecting an alliance with Ennahda meant alienating a third of voters.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Marzouk-led camp saw the alliance as a betrayal of voters who considered Nidaa Tounes to be a counterweight to Ennahda, weakening the party's standing as the defender of Tunisia's secularist tradition.\n\n\n\nFollowing lengthy political wrangling, Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda wound up forming a coalition government, with an independent technocrat as prime minister.\n\nJoining forces against Hafedh\n\nNidaa Tounes' members would grow divided once again, as the compromise prime minister, Habib Essid, was sacked - and young technocrat and Nidaa Tounes member, Chahed, was appointed in August 2016.\n\n\n\nChahed fell out of favour once he began making changes to his cabinet in late February 2017, sacking Nidaa Tounes-approved ministers without consulting his party.\n\n\n\n\"We have not put [Chahed] in this position so that he could appoint collaborators that we do not know or that he treat ministers from Nidaa Tounes in such a way,\" Hafedh is heard saying in a leaked audio recording of a party meeting in 2017.\n\n\n\nChahed would go on to declare a \"war on corruption\" later that year, targeting wealthy businessmen, including members of his own party. Corruption, still rife in Tunisia, was one of the main catalysts of the uprising.\n\n\n\nFrom that point onwards, according to analysts, Chahed understood that he would need Ennahda's support to survive a confidence vote in parliament, should it come to that.\n\n\n\nHe also obtained the support of Marzouk's camp in parliament. The two found common cause in their opposition to the president's son, Hafedh, who in turn began pressuring Ennahda to withdraw its support for the prime minister, which the party consistently resisted.\n\n\n\nThe internal rift culminated in Nidaa Tounes' suspension of the prime minister's party membership in mid-September, and Essebsi's unexpected announcement of the end of his alliance with Ennahda a few days later.\n\n\"The consensus and relationship between me and Ennahda has ended, after they chose to form another relationship with Youssef Chahed,\" Essebsi said in a televised interview.\n\nToday, \"the lines of conflict are similar,\" said Dihstelhoff. \"The connection with Ennahda is still a major point of contention.\"\n\nDihstelhoff said that while Ennahda cannot be held directly accountable for the division within Nidaa Tounes, its decision to support the prime minister has accelerated the latter's \"internal disintegration process\".\n\n\n\nEnnahda claimed that its support for Chahed stemmed from the belief that an entirely new cabinet would further destabilise the country at a sensitive time.\n\n\n\nIn effect, the 43-year-old technocrat is the seventh head of government in as many years, and his most recent cabinet reshuffle, although partial, is the 10th major government overhaul since 2011.\n\nParting ways with Nidaa\n\nMP Leila Chettaoui, a former member of Nidaa Tounes and supporter of Chahed in parliament, recently told local media the prime minister was finalising the formation of his own party.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in parliament last month, Chahed lamented that his government had been forced to work \"under random shelling from friendly fire for the past two years\".\n\n\n\nThe news of Chahed's new political project, which Nidaa Tounes has taken as a move to \"target\" the party, would solidify the shift in Tunisia's political landscape seen in the exodus of Nidaa members from the party.\n\n\n\nAmidst this internal strife, Ennahda's backing for Chahed is viewed as tacit support for Chahed's possible candidacy in the presidential election - due to take place later next year.\n\n\n\nRiahi's legal proceeding against Chahed \"is part of a political battle between his party and Ennahda,\" said political analyst Youssef Cherif in an email interview.\n\n\n\n\"Nidaa Tounes is relying on the state apparatus to counter Ennahda,\" he said, in reference to the military judiciary's involvement with the legal proceedings.\n\n\n\nEnnahda \"tried to bypass\" Essebsi, so \"he's now counter attacking,\" said Cherif.\n\n\n\n\"Will they find a way out of their disagreement and reconvene? Maybe. But now Essebsi is raising the bar amid a tense climate. That's dangerous for Tunisia's stability,\" he added.\n\n\n\nWith unemployment hovering above 15 percent and inflation estimated at eight per cent, Tunisia had its largest general strike in five years take place late last month, and unions have warned there is more to come.\n\n\n\nTunisia is going through \"a difficult phase of political turmoil\" that has taken the form of \"increasing protests and strikes, caused by the deterioration of the socioeconomic conditions of the largest part of the population,\" said political commentator Mohamed-Dhia Hammami.\n\n\n\nAs for stability, Cherif said Nidaa Tounes is \"collapsing and it's been collapsing since 2015\".\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it will recover now.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Strong aftershock follows magnitude 7.5 quake off New Caledonia", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/tsunami-warning-magnitude-76-quake-strikes-caledonia-181205043532165.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "A powerful aftershock hit off New Caledonia on Wednesday just hours after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the Pacific region, which triggered a tsunami warning, authorities said.\n\nThe US Geological Survey said the new earthquake measured 6.6, downgrading it from from an initial measurement of 7.0.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, a shallow and powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the east coast of New Caledonia , with the epicentre reported some 300 kilometres east of Noumea.\n\nThe undersea quake was only 10km deep and about 155km east-southeast of the Loyalty Islands off New Caledonia's east coast.

end of the advisory guideline range is appropriate and warranted\".\n\nThe recommendation by Mueller comes almost two weeks before Flynn's sentencing, on December 18.\n\nThe documents, consisting of a sentencing recommendation and a partially redacted addendum to protect ongoing investigations, state that Flynn was an important cooperator after Mueller's team reached a plea deal with the former

witnesses to be forthcoming,\" the court filings said.\n\n\"The defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government,\" it

a total of 36 people have been indicted in the Mueller investigation, which was started in May 2016 to investigate links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Threatens To Withdraw from INF Missile Treaty With Russia", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4687428.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States will withdraw from a milestone Cold War-era nuclear treaty unless Russia returns to compliance.

That pledge, however, comes on the heels of auto giant General Motors' announcement of the layoff of 14,000 employees in five factories in the United States and Canada.\n\nDespite the president's optimistic pronouncements, the General Motors announcement indicates broader market shifts in the automotive industry that are unlikely to be reversed.\n\nGeneral Motors justified the decision as a result of shifting economic trends that have seen consumer preferences shift away from mid-sized vehicles and toward sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and electric cars. The company said the move \"is transforming its global workforce to ensure the right skill sets for today and the future.\"\n\nThose moves toward increased efficiency also include a 25 percent cut of the executive workforce.\n\nBut in Lordstown, Ohio, workers whose livelihoods have depended on jobs in GM factories struggled to understand the move.\n\nMid-sized autos\n\nThe Lordstown plant manufactures the Chevy Cruze, one of the mid-sized cars auto manufacturers no longer see as profitable. Trump specifically addressed the impact on the Lordstown plant shortly after GM's decision, saying, \"They say the Chevy Cruze is not selling well. I say, 'Well, get a car that is selling well and put it back in.'\"\n\nWorkers are holding on to that hope with the Lordstown plant in an \"unallocated status\" that leaves open the possibility of GM moving in another product. Local union leader Dave Green acknowledged that issues with the Chevy Cruze were part of an overall industry trend away from smaller cars.\n\n\"They're not building cars, sedans anymore, but people are still buying cars,\" Green told VOA. \"Part of it is that they need to be priced right and they need to be priced fair. If I can go into a dealership and lease an SUV cheaper than a Chevy Cruze \u2014 you know, most Americans want more for less. So they're going to get the bigger, the better, the more for less and it is what it is. I think the car was priced a little out of its range.\"\n\nThe 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown plant is well-placed in the center of the country, with easy access to major highway artery Interstate Highway 80 and an infrastructure of secondary plants.\n\nGreen said 80 percent of the plant's production is sold within a 600-mile radius. \"GM would be foolish to walk away from it,\" he said.\n\nThe 1,600 workers anticipating a March 2019 layoff from the Lordstown plant certainly hope that's the case. They earn $30-40 an hour compared to the next best option in the area, $10 an hour at the aluminum factory.\n\nLordstown is part of the broader Warren-Youngstown, Ohio, area that once thrived on the presence of steel mill manufacturing. When those plants shut down in the 1970s and '80s, the auto industry became the lifeblood of the local economy.\n\n\"That's is the largest plant that we have,\" said Trish Williams, owner of the Ice House restaurant in Austintown, Ohio. She has several family members and friends who have worked at the GM plant in the past and present.\n\n\"That keeps this town going. Our steel mills are gone. Our factories are gone. [Hewlitt] Packard is closed. General Electric is gone. Chrysler is gone and GM was it. GM was what kept this here \u2014 it may turn into a ghost town,\" Williams said.\n\n'Don't sell your house'\n\nTrump visited Youngstown in July 2017, telling workers, \"Don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Do not sell it. We're going to get those values up. We're going to get those jobs coming back. And we're going to fill up those factories, or rip them down and build brand new ones.\"\n\nMany residents said they do not hold Trump responsible for GM's decision, a move that could devastate the local economy.\n\n\"The president doesn't own GM,\" waitress Lisa Miller said. \"Nor can he say you can't do this, you can't do that. We are a free country. I believe the president will push with all his might \u2014 as we've already seen him doing \u2014 to keep them here and to change things, but this was something that was out of his hands.\"\n\nJust days after the GM announcement, Miller said she was already noticing a drop in sales and an end to the usual lunch to-go orders from GM workers.\n\nSome of those workers will be able to transfer to other plants around the country based on their seniority within GM. But many workers expressed concern to VOA about the number of temporary employees \u2014 who earn far lower rates per hour \u2014 working in those plants. They are also aware of GM's plant in Mexico that builds the Chevy Blazer, an SUV.\n\n\"Why is our plant not getting the Blazer?\" asked Rebecca Zak, an 18-year veteran of the Lordstown GM plant. \"Why is it being built in Mexico? It's mind-blowing. I heard in Ramos, Mexico, they get paid $2.65 an hour.\"\n\nZak said she sees the decision as part of a trend toward corporations enriching themselves at the expense of the worker.\n\n\"We're the ones that build this car, we are the ones that got this company this far and who are the ones who are suffering? The worker, not corporate America. Six billion dollars in the third-quarter and they can justify laying off 14,000 people,\" she said.\n\nGM workforce\n\nThose 14,000 people represent just 7 percent of GM's 180,000-person workforce, a strategic shift for a company in a competitive automotive market. What remains to be seen is whether that strategic shift will include places like Lordstown.\n\nBut as Lordstown employee Dan Smith said, \"Any industry is cyclical. Gas could go up to $5 a gallon and then, poof, there goes the truck-SUV market. And they're going to need small cars. It's something we went through, my dad's worked there.\"\n\nSmith said he was shocked by the decision but did not entirely fault GM for operating a plant in Mexico with lower-paid labor.\n\n\"Business-wise that makes sense, but then to sell it here in the United States doesn't make much sense for American people to buy an American car that's built in another country,\" he told VOA.\n\nFor Williams, waiting to see how the decision impacts her community and her business, the equation seemed simple.\n\n\"Smaller cars, bigger cars \u2014 they all have four wheels,\" she said. \"They've made other cars off that line \u2014 why not bring another car back?\"\n\nWatch Related Video Story:"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Experts See Risks in Trump's Plan to Meet with North Korea's Kim", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-see-risks-in-trump-plan-to-meet-with-north-korea-kim-jong-un/4687341.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "North Korea experts have cautioned against another summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, citing a lack of progress on denuclearization since the first summit in Singapore.\n\nAfter meeting with the leaders of South Korea and China during the G-20 summit, Trump expressed a willingness to hold a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOn his way home from the weekend gathering in Buenos Aires, Trump said a second summit with Kim will likely take place in January or February and three sites were discussed as potential meeting locations.\n\n\u200b\"We're getting along very well,\" Trump said. \"We have a good relationship with Kim.\"\n\nThe White House released a statement during the G-20 summit saying \"great progress has been made\" on Trump's discussions on North Korea.\n\n\"It was \u2026 agreed that great progress has been made with respect to North Korea that President Trump, together with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping], will strive, along with Chairman Kim Jong Un, to see a nuclear free Korean Peninsula,\" said the White House.\n\nHowever, former U.S. officials who have dealt with North Korea extensively and analysts on North Korea have questioned the timing of a second summit.\n\nThey argue that working-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang should come before Trump meets with Kim, emphasizing working-level negotiations are where progress on denuclearization can be made.\n\nRobert Gallucci, chief U.S. negotiator during the 1994 North Korean nuclear crisis, said, \"What I care about is that there would be real progress.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And that is going to take [place] in the working-group level discussions about what the North Koreans expect, and what we are prepared to give in order to make progress towards our goal.\"\n\nChristopher Hill, a chief negotiator with North Korea during the George W.

The cancellation came after Pyongyang refused to engage with Stephen Biegun, the U.S. point man on North Korea. Some experts believe Pyongyang is only interested in direct talks with Trump.\n\nBruce Klingner, former CIA division chief for the Korea and current senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said Pyongyang sees Trump as \"more likely to offer additional concessions, as he did in Singapore.\"\n\n\"It would be a mistake to convene a second summit without real progress toward a comprehensive agreement on North Korean denuclearization,\" Klingner said.\n\nRobert Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, also cautioned against holding another summit.\n\n\"The first summit outcome was so ambiguous that it has not provided any impetus for detailed negotiations or a framework for talks to resolve the whole set of issues,\" Manning said.\n\nDuring a press briefing last week, Robert Palladino, deputy spokesperson for the State Department said, \"Future dialogue will take place and it'll definitely be something that Special Representative Biegun will be leading.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. remains open to talks with North Korea, it is maintaining that sanctions will stay in place until the North takes steps toward denuclearization.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after Trump's meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in during the G-20 summit, the White House said the two leaders \"agreed on the importance of maintaining vigorous enforcement of existing sanctions\" against North Korea.\n\nMoon said Tuesday he hopes Kim's visit to South Korea occurs this year, although a specific date is yet to be determined.\n\n\"Although there is no timeframe set for that, still, it's very meaningful,\" said Moon from New Zealand about Kim's visit."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Thousands of Visitors Pay Respects to Former President Before Funeral in Washington", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4687430.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "The body of former U.S. President George H.

It's about the committees that we'll be appointed to. It's about the values- and issues-based caucuses that we'll serve on. And it's about us simply leveraging the platform that we have available to us as well as our social media networks,'' Pressley said.\n\nPressley won election to the House by beating a fellow Democrat - longtime U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano - in a September primary.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said like-minded incoming Democratic members of the House have the numbers needed to press their case for change.\n\n\"We have a magic number in the House ... and it's 218,'' she said. \"Two hundred and eighteen is the magic number to get things done and how many member Democratic freshmen do we have?

Since 1972, the program has hosted nearly 700 current and new member of Congress.\n\n\"There is nothing adversarial,'' Pressley said. \"This is about us lifting up the voices, the stories, the struggles, the innovation and the ideas of the people that we represent.

They always want to bring up the fact that I've been very active in closing coal-fired power plants.''\n\n\n\nSteyer on Tuesday turned his focus to voting rights \u2014 one of the \"five rights'' in the platform he released last month \u2014 calling South Carolina the \"perfect place'' to begin that conversation.\n\n\"If you look historically, South Carolina has a long history of trying to make sure that people don't have equal votes,'' Steyer said at the start of the town hall. He called South Carolina a state that, \"whether people here enjoy it or appreciate it or are sorry about it,'' plays an outsized part in the national conversation about the future of the country.\n\n\n\nBoth men have been sharply critical of Trump and agree that he is not fit for the presidency. Steyer, who has amassed a 6 million-person email list from his \u201cNeed to Impeach\u201d campaign against Trump, has repeatedly said Trump is a danger to the country and must be ousted.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Steyer described Trump as \"the most corrupt president in American history who is a basic threat to our system and our safety and to the Constitution itself.'' He said that many politicians, from both parties, \u201cdon't think it's good for their careers to talk about that.''\n\n\n\nBloomberg, however, said, \"It would be a mistake to say anything about that before you see what comes out of the investigation'' being conducted by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling.\n\nBackers of Democratic candidates\n\n\n\nBloomberg and Steyer spent millions during the 2018 midterm campaigns on behalf of Democratic candidates. Their travel gave them new opportunities to test their message and, perhaps most important, gauge the interest of Democratic primary voters and activists in the potential candidacies.\n\n\n\nIn the Des Moines area, Bloomberg was visiting a community college's wind-energy program and was scheduled to meet with mothers organized to curb gun violence before attending a screening of his climate change film, \"Paris to Pittsburgh.''\n\n\n\nBloomberg contributed $250,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party this year, giving him some claim to gains such as capturing two Republican-held House seats last month. He also has plans to meet with key Democratic operatives. But other potential candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, have been more aggressive in their efforts."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Special Counsel Mueller Recommends No Prison Time for Flynn", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/special-counsel-mueller-recommends-no-prison-time-for-flynn-/4687329.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump's former national security adviser provided so much information to the special counsel's Russia investigation that prosecutors say he shouldn't do any prison time, according to a court filing Tuesday that describes Michael Flynn's cooperation as \"substantial.\"\n\n\n\nThe filing by special counsel Robert Mueller provides the first details of Flynn's assistance in the Russia investigation, including that he participated in 19 interviews with prosecutors and cooperated extensively in a separate and undisclosed criminal probe. But the filing's lengthy redactions also underscore how much Mueller has yet to reveal.\n\n\n\nIt was filed two weeks ahead of Flynn's sentencing and just over a year after he became the first of five Trump associates to accept responsibility by pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\n\n\n\nThough prosecutors withheld specific details of Flynn's cooperation because of ongoing investigations, their filing nonetheless illustrates the breadth of information Mueller has obtained from people close to Trump as the president increasingly vents his anger at the probe \u2014 and those who cooperate with it.\n\n\n\nThis week, Trump accused his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, of making up \"stories\" to get a reduced prison sentence after pleading guilty to lying to Congress and also praised longtime confidante Roger Stone for saying he wouldn't testify against Trump.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will now turn his fury on Flynn, whom Trump bonded with during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nTrump has repeatedly lamented how Flynn's life has been destroyed by the special counsel's probe. At one point, he tried to protect Flynn by asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into his alleged false statements, according to a memo Comey wrote after the February 2017 encounter.\n\n\n\nThat episode, which Trump has denied, is among those under scrutiny by Mueller as he probes whether the president attempted to obstruct the Russia investigation.\n\n\n\nFederal sentencing guidelines recommend between zero and six months in prison, and Mueller's office said Flynn's cooperation merits no prison time.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said Flynn's early cooperation was \"particularly valuable\" because he was \"one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight\" into the events under investigation. They noted his cooperation likely inspired other crucial witnesses to cooperate.\n\n\n\nMueller's team credited Flynn with serving 33 years in the U.S. Army, including five years in combat. But prosecutors also said the long military and government service that sets him apart from all other defendants in the investigation made his deception more troublesome.\n\n\n\n\"The defendant's extensive government service should have made him particularly aware of the harm caused by providing false information to the government, as well as the rules governing work performed on behalf of a foreign government,\" they wrote.\n\n\n\nFlynn's case has stood apart from those of other Trump associates, who have aggressively criticized the investigation, sought to undermine it and, in some cases, been accused of lying even after agreeing to cooperate.\n\n\n\nTrump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is accused of repeatedly lying to investigators since his guilty plea. Another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, is serving a 14-day prison sentence and, though he pleaded guilty to the same crime as Flynn, was denied probation because prosecutors said his cooperation was lacking.\n\n\n\nBut Flynn has largely remained out of the public eye, appearing only sporadically in media interviews or campaign events, and avoided criticizing the Mueller probe despite widespread encouragement from his supporters to go on the offensive. He has instead spent considerable time with his family and worked to position himself for a post-conviction career.\n\n\n\nIn Tuesday's filing, prosecutors emphasized that the conduct Flynn lied about cuts to the core of the investigation into any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\n\nFlynn's false statements stemmed from a Jan. 24, 2017, interview with the FBI about his interactions with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's then-ambassador to the U.S., as the Obama administration was levying sanctions on the Kremlin in response to election interference.\n\n\n\nMueller's office blamed Flynn for other senior Trump transition officials making misleading public statements about his contacts with Russia, an assertion that matches the White House's explanation of Flynn's firing.\n\n\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" the filing said.\n\n\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Flynn said members of Trump's inner circle, including his son-in-law and White House aide Jared Kushner, were involved in \u2014 and at times directing \u2014 his actions in the weeks before Trump took office.\n\n\n\nAccording to court papers, in mid-December 2016, Kushner directed Flynn to reach out to several countries, including Russia, about a U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements. During those conversations with Kislyak, Flynn asked Russia to delay or vote against the resolution, a request the Kremlin ultimately rejected.\n\n\n\nFlynn also admitted that later in December 2016 he asked Kislyak not to retaliate in response to the Obama administration sanctions, something he initially told FBI agents he didn't do. Flynn made the request after discussing it with deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, who was at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and being told that Trump's transition team did not want Russia to escalate the situation.\n\n\n\nFlynn was forced to resign his post on Feb. 13, 2017, after news reports revealed that Obama administration officials had warned the Trump White House about Flynn's false statements. The White House has said Flynn misled officials \u2014 including Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 about the content of his conversations.\n\n\n\nFlynn also admitted to making false statements about unregistered foreign agent work he performed for the benefit of the Turkish government, a matter Mueller's team cited in Tuesday's filing. Flynn was under investigation by the Justice Department for the work when he became national security adviser."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Ballot Fraud Investigation Muddies North Carolina Election", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ballot-fraud-investigation-muddies-north-carolina-election-/4687320.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Allegations of flagrant absentee ballot fraud in a North Carolina district have thrown the Election Day results of one of the nation's last unresolved midterm congressional races into question.\n\nUnofficial ballot totals showed Republican Mark Harris ahead of Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in the 9th Congressional District. But the state elections board refused to certify the results last week in view of \u201cclaims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities\u201d involving mail-in ballots in the district.\n\nThe elections board has subpoenaed documents from the Harris campaign, a campaign attorney confirmed Tuesday. Investigators seem to be concentrating on activities linked to a longtime political operative from Bladen County, where allegations about mail-in absentee ballots also surfaced two years ago during a tight election for governor.\n\nIn affidavits offered by the state Democratic Party, voters described a woman coming to their homes to collect their absentee ballots, whether or not they had been completed properly. State law bars this kind of \u201charvesting\u201d of absentee ballots, which must be submitted by mail or in person by the voter or a close family member.\n\nIf the allegations are accurate, \u201cthis is the biggest absentee fraud in a generation or two in North Carolina,\u201d said Gerry Cohen, an election law expert and former longtime legislative staff attorney. \u201cNorth Carolina has a long history of this kind of thing, particularly in rural areas.\u201d\n\nConcerns about voter harvesting worried state election officials so much that they sent a letter to every Bladen County address where a voter requested a mail-in ballot asking the voter to call them if someone else tried take the ballot or fill it out.\n\n\u201cElections officials will never come to your house to pick up your absentee ballot or tell you how to vote,\u201d the letter warned.\n\nThe portion of Bladen County in the 9th District was the only place in the district's eight counties where Harris won a majority of the mail-in ballots, according to unofficial election data. Bladen and Robeson County \u2014 where officials also have requested information \u2014 had the highest percentages of unreturned mail-in absentee ballots in the state, according to Catawba College political scientist Michael Bitzer. The total number of unreturned ballots for Bladen and Robeson in the 9th exceeded the current margin.\n\nThe district attorney in Raleigh announced this week that she's been investigating potential Bladen County \u201cvoting irregularities\u201d since last January. The investigation that began with claims from 2016 has now spread to this year\u2019s primary and general elections, Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman said in an interview.\n\nFreeman said she was investigating in part because of comments made by McCrae Dowless of Bladen County during a State Board of Elections hearing in December 2016. Dowless worked as a contractor for Harris' chief strategist in the campaign, Harris campaign lawyer John Branch confirmed Tuesday.\n\nDowless, who served prison time in 1995 for felony fraud and was convicted of felony perjury in 1992, has worked on get-out-the-vote efforts for various local and legislative candidates through the years. Dowless put his name on an elections protest, backed at the time by the campaign of then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, that alleged a ``massive scheme'' by a local political group to run an ``absentee ballot mill'' to improperly submit votes for a write-in candidate for a position Dowless was seeking.\n\nBut the board peppered Dowless with questions about his own absentee ballot activities. Dowless acknowledged he hired people in 2016 to urge voters to turn in absentee ballot request forms, which is legal. In sworn testimony, Dowless said he never handled or filled out the actual ballots. The board dismissed Dowless' protest but sent all of its evidence to local and federal prosecutors.\n\nVisited by a reporter Tuesday at his Bladenboro home, Dowless declined to comment. He said the voice on the speaker phone in his hand was that of an attorney advising he decline to describe his election activities.\n\nDocuments released late Tuesday by the elections board as part of its investigation show Dowless appears to have been the top collector of Bladen County absentee ballot requests this fall. A copy of the Bladen election board\u2019s log book shows Dowless turned in well over 500 applications.\n\nThe elections board has said it will hold a hearing on the allegations on or before Dec. 21. Board members can call for a new election if they find enough problems that could have altered the outcome or cast doubts on the election's fairness. An election would take place well after the new session of Congress convenes Jan. 3, likely creating a temporary vacancy.\n\nRepublican leaders say Harris, a Southern Baptist minister, should be certified the winner, saying no evidence has been made public that show he didn't get the most lawful votes.\n\n\u201cThe campaign was not aware of any illegal conduct in connection with the 9th District race,\u201d Branch said in a statement.\n\nAlthough Democrats won enough House seats nationally to take back the chamber come January, the 9th is gaining attention in part because a Republican has held the seat continuously since 1963. Democrats had hoped McCready, an Iraq War veteran, would end the streak, especially after Harris edged U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger in the May GOP primary.\n\nIncoming Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Tuesday that a \u201cvery substantial question\u201d about fraud exists and hopes state officials \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the controversy. Hoyer said Harris is \u201cnot eligible for being sworn into the House\u201d at this point."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Gorillas, Given a Puzzle, Find Way to Cheat", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gorillas-in-experiment-given-a-puzzle-find-a-way-to-cheat/4687346.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Gorillas at a zoo in England have demonstrated a distinctly human trait while attempting to solve a puzzle: cheating.\n\n\n\nThe gorillas were presented with a wall-mounted puzzle that requires the user to guide a peanut through a series of obstacles by poking a stick through various holes.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its Global Humanitarian Overview 2019 report.\n\n\n\nIt cited World Bank data predicting 140 million people could be internally displaced by 2050 as a result of global warming.\n\n\n\nAmong the countries being significantly hit by climate-linked extreme weather is the United States, whose President Donald Trump is one of the most prominent skeptics of man-made climate change, the agency said.\n\nHurricanes and storms in the United States and Caribbean caused more than $220 billion worth of damage last year, representing nearly two-thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, OCHA said.\n\n\n\n\"Climate events are contributing to greater humanitarian problems than we have seen in the past,\" said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for OCHA. \"This is something the world has not yet adapted fully to.\"\n\n\n\nAs hurricanes and tropical cyclones intensify in strength, they are particularly hurting poor nations that are unprepared for the threat, researchers said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland.\n\n\n\nIn the tiny island country of Dominica, Maria caused losses equal to more than twice its gross domestic product, damaging or destroying about 90 percent of housing.\n\n\n\nLloyd Pascal, a Dominican climate negotiator whose home has yet to be fully repaired after being hit by the storm, urged the U.N. talks to pay more attention to \"weaker countries.\"\n\n\n\nDominica, with 72,000 people, lacks the ability to prepare for the increasingly severe weather it is suffering, he said.\n\n\n\nEven though storm warnings are received, the state does not have resources to evacuate people into shelters, he said, nor understand clearly how heavy rainfall will boost river levels.\n\n\n\n\"We are just not prepared to do that kind of work,\" he told reporters. \"We are like sitting ducks.\"\n\n\n\nBut rich countries, including the United States, also are seeing clearer climate impacts, and need to step up efforts to keep their people safe, Germanwatch said.\n\n\n\n\"Effective climate protection, as well as increasing resilience, is ... in the self-interest of these countries,\" Eckstein said.\n\n\n\nThe Germanwatch index highlighted other types of weather-related damage as well, from unusually heavy rainfall to landslides.\n\nSri Lanka, the second most-affected country in 2017, saw dramatic floods that year that killed 200 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. climate negotiations should drum up more support for the poorest countries like Nepal, Vietnam, Sierra Leone and Madagascar to deal with rising losses linked to climate change, Germanwatch said.\n\n\n\nAll four of those countries figured in the index's top 10 of nations most affected by weather disasters in 2017.\n\n\n\n\"They need predictable and reliable financial support for dealing with climate-induced loss and damage,\" Eckstein said.\n\n\n\nFive years ago, the U.N. climate talks set up a mechanism to better understand the damage that now will be unavoidable as a result of the 1 degree Celsius hike in global temperatures that has already occurred.\n\n\n\nThe mechanism also seeks to find ways to deal with the consequences as the world warms further.\n\n\n\nBut industrialized countries \u2014 which have historically emitted the most climate-changing emissions \u2014 have refused to pay compensation to those who are less to blame for global warming yet find themselves on the front line of impacts.\n\n\n\nInstead, they are providing access to insurance.\n\n\n\nAt the Dec. 2-14 talks in Poland, arguments are expected over how progress on dealing with \"loss and damage\" should be assessed in 2023, when countries measure their climate action against the goals of the Paris climate accord."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "World's First Baby Born Via Womb Transplant From Dead Donor", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-first-baby-born-via-womb-transplant-from-dead-donor/4687305.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "A woman in Brazil who received a womb transplanted from a deceased donor has given birth to a baby girl in the first successful case of its kind, doctors reported.\n\nThe case, published in The Lancet medical journal, involved connecting veins from the donor uterus with the recipient's veins, as well as linking arteries, ligaments and vaginal canals.\n\nIt comes after 10 previously known cases of uterus transplants from deceased donors -

Scientists have so far reported a total of 39 procedures of this kind, resulting in 11 live births.\n\nExperts estimate that infertility affects around 10 to 15 percent of couples of reproductive age worldwide. Of this group, around one in 500 women have uterine problems.\n\nBefore uterus transplants became possible, the only options to have a child were adoption or surrogacy.\n\nIn the Brazilian case, the recipient had been born without a uterus due to a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome. The donor was 45 and died of a stroke.\n\nFive months after the transplant, Ejzenberg's team wrote, the uterus showed no signs of rejection, ultrasound scans were normal, and the recipient was having regular menstruation. The woman's previously fertilized and frozen eggs were implanted after seven months and 10 days later she was confirmed pregnant.\n\nAt seven months and 20 days - when the case study report was submitted to The Lancet - the baby girl was continuing to breastfeed and weighed 7.2 kg (16 lb)."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Public Anger as Air Pollution in Western Balkan Cities Worsens", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/public-anger-as-air-pollution-in-western-balkan-cities-worsens/4686719.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "When winter arrives in the Western Balkans, it is not unusual for dense smog to envelop its cities, making it hard to breathe and impairing visibility. But this year, pollution levels are among the highest in the world and public anger is on the rise.\n\nIn recent days, the Bosnian, Macedonian and Kosovar capitals topped the charts of the world's most polluted cities as the smog intensified due to heavy traffic, excessive use of coal, poor spatial planning and solid fuel based heating.\n\nThe air quality index measured by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo hit 383 on Tuesday, a level identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as hazardous to health and almost 10 times the average. In Pristina, the index registered 415 on Monday night and marked air quality in several Macedonian towns as very poor.\n\n\"This is all the result of a situation in which political elites treat the city as a construction plot which should be occupied at all costs rather than a place where people live,\" Anes Podic of Sarajevo's Eko Akcija environmental group said.\n\n\"You can feel how bad the air smells even inside the car or home,\" said a taxi driver Mirsad Pobric.\n\nAccording to the WHO, pollution costs Bosnia the equivalent of more than a fifth of its annual gross domestic product (GDP) every year \u2014 around $3.9 billion \u2014 in lost work and school days, healthcare and fuel costs.\n\nMacedonia loses an equivalent of 3.2 percent of GDP a year to pollution, the World Bank said in a report, more than$360 million a year.\n\nAs a way of bringing more attention to the issue, the Embassy of Sweden has been using red lighting on its facade in central Sarajevo to reflect air quality each day. The deeper the red, the worse the pollution.\n\nAccording to the WHO, 230 Bosnians die of air pollution per 100,000 citizens a year, compared to 0.4 in Sweden. The World Bank estimates that in Macedonia there are 1,350 deaths related to air pollution per year.\n\n\"Pollution is killing people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, therefore something really needs to be done,\" Swedish Ambassador Anders Hagelberg told Reuters.\n\nAs part of efforts to combat the issue, Sweden has launched a four-year project in Bosnia that will bring together experts from its Environmental Protection Agency and local hydro-meteorological agencies and governments.\n\nThe aim of the program is to help improve air quality monitoring but also to bring more investment into energy efficiency.\n\nMacedonia has launched its own program to combat air pollution to which the government allocated 1.6 million euros ($1.83 million) in next year's budget. It aims to halve Skopje's air pollution within two years by reducing taxes for central heating, restricting traffic and introducing stricter control of industrial emissions.\n\nActivists say the funds allocated are insufficient and that the government's response is inadequate."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "UN Chief Calls for Momentum at 2019 Climate Summit", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-calls-momentum-2019-climate-summit/4686341.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "The U.N. secretary-general on Tuesday urged world leaders to use a climate change summit he will host in 2019 to explain how they plan to ratchet up their efforts to reverse worsening global warming that is leading to a \"very dramatic situation.\"\n\nAntonio Guterres said the gathering at the United Nations in New York in September would be an \"essential piece\" in raising ambition to cut heat-trapping emissions, and helping countries cope better with wilder weather and rising seas.\n\nThe summit also will seek to raise more funding to ensure wealthy governments keep a 2020 promise to deliver $100 billion annually to help poor countries develop cleanly and adapt to a hotter planet, the U.N. chief added.\n\n\"We all know the massive scale of the climate challenge we face,\" he told reporters at climate talks in Poland. \"And we all know we are not on track.\"\n\nIn 2020, countries are due to submit to the United Nations updated national climate action plans that are the lynchpin of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015.\n\nUnder that accord, nearly 200 governments have committed to limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.\n\nThere has already been an increase of about 1 degree C, and current pledges to reduce emissions are still likely to lead to warming of about 3 degrees C this century, scientists have said. In the coming year, U.N. agencies will work with governments to strengthen their climate action plans covering the decade to 2030, as well as their long-term strategies, Guterres said.\n\nClimate experts said on Tuesday they expected countries to issue a political declaration at the end of the December 2-14 climate talks in Katowice that would firmly signal their intention to do more to cut emissions from 2020.\n\nThey should then \"sharpen their pencils\" and consult with government authorities, businesses and civil society back home to work out how to achieve that, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe world has seen \"a technology revolution since Paris,\" he said, with renewable energy generation and storage now far cheaper \u2014 something countries must make the most of in revising their 2020 plans to cut emissions.\n\nIn Katowice, government officials are hammering out rules on how to measure and track emissions reductions under the Paris deal, seeking a formula to achieve widespread and ambitious cuts that is fair to countries with fewer resources.\n\nThere are also complex discussions on how rich states should track the funding they have provided and indicate the amount they will contribute in future years \u2014 a touchy subject with some governments reluctant to make promises.\n\nGuterres said a central objective of his 2019 summit would be to provide a \"transparent approach\" to delivering $100 billion to vulnerable countries each year from 2020-2025, when a new target is due to kick in.\n\nHe urged donors to replenish the coffers of the flagship Green Climate Fund by the time of the summit, a process the fund's board has said it aims to complete by October 2019.\n\nThe summit, designed to spur political commitment to action, will also involve different groups tackling climate change, from cities and companies to young people, the U.N. said in a briefing note.\n\nThe summit aims to win promises for on-the-ground change in polluting industries from oil to cement, and target how supply chains and technology can cut emissions and waste, particularly from farming and food systems.\n\nIt also wants cities to make new commitments on low-emission buildings, mass transport and green urban infrastructure, as well as protection for poor communities such as slum dwellers.\n\n\"The summit is not an end in itself,\" Guterres said. \"It is ... a tool to leverage unprecedented ambition, transformation and mobilization.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Where Are\u00a0Drones?

And it\u2019s unclear when, if ever, this particular order by the company\u2019s founder and CEO will arrive.\n\nBezos made billions of dollars by transforming the retail sector. But overcoming the regulatory hurdles and safety issues posed by drones appears to be a challenge even for the world\u2019s wealthiest man. The result is a blown deadline on his claim to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in December 2013 that drones would be making deliveries within five years.\n\nThe day may not be far off when drones will carry medicine to people in rural or remote areas, but the marketing hype around instant delivery of consumer goods looks more and more like just that \u2014 hype. Drones have a short battery life, and privacy concerns can be a hindrance, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will see delivery of burritos or diapers in the suburbs,\u201d says drone analyst Colin Snow.\n\nDrone usage has grown rapidly in some industries, but mostly outside the retail sector and direct interaction with consumers.\n\nThe government estimates that about 110,000 commercial drones are operating in U.S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022. They are being used in rural areas for mining and agriculture, for inspecting power lines and pipelines, and for surveying.\n\nAmazon says it is still pushing ahead with plans to use drones for quick deliveries, though the company is staying away from fixed timelines.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to making our goal of delivering packages by drones in 30 minutes or less a reality,\u201d says Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish. The Seattle-based online retail giant says it has drone development centers in the United States, Austria, France, Israel and the United Kingdom.\n\nDelivery companies have been testing the use of drones to deliver emergency supplies and to cover ground quickly in less populated areas. By contrast, package deliveries would be concentrated in office parks and neighborhoods where there are bigger issues around safety and privacy.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration approved a three-year program for private companies and local government agencies to test drones for deliveries, inspections and other tasks.\n\nBut pilot programs by major delivery companies suggest few Americans will be greeted by package-bearing drones any time soon. United Parcel Service tested launching a drone from a delivery truck that was covering a rural route in Florida. DHL Express, the German delivery company, tested the use of drones to deliver medicine from Tanzania to an island in Lake Victoria.\n\nFrank Appel, the CEO of DHL\u2019s parent company, Deutsche Post AG, said \u201cover the next couple of years\u201d drones will remain a niche vehicle and not widely used. He said a big obstacle is battery life.\n\n\u201cIf you have to recharge them every other hour, then you need so many drones and you have to orchestrate that. So good luck with that,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nAppel said human couriers have another big advantage over drones: They know where customers live and which doorbell to ring. \u201cTo program that in IT is not that easy and not cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts say it will take years for the Federal Aviation Administration to write all the rules to allow widespread drone deliveries.\n\nSnow, the CEO of Skylogic Research, says a rule permitting operators to fly drones beyond their line of sight \u2014 so critical to deliveries \u2014 is at least 10 years away. A method will be needed to let law enforcement identify drones flying over people \u2014 federal officials are worried about their use by terrorists.\n\nWhile the rules are being written, companies will rely on waivers from the FAA to keep experimenting and running small-scale pilot programs.\n\n\u201cPeople like DHL and the rest of them (will say), \u2018Hey, we can deliver via drone this parcel package to this island,\u2019 but that\u2019s not the original vision that Amazon presented,\u201d Snow says.\n\nThere is a long list of FAA rules governing drone flights. They generally can\u2019t fly higher than 400 feet, over many federal facilities, or within five miles of an airport. Night flights are forbidden. For the delivery business, the most biggest holdup is that the machines must remain within sight of the operator at all times.\n\nIn June, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the FAA\u2019s was being overly conservative in its safety standards for drones. The group said FAA\u2019s risk-averse attitude was holding back beneficial uses, such as drones helping firefighters who are battling a fierce blaze.\n\nEven before the criticism by the scientific panel, the FAA had begun to respond more quickly to operators\u2019 requests for waivers from some rules, says Alan Perlman, founder of the Drone Pilot Ground School in Nashville, Tennessee. He said it is also getting easier and cheaper to buy liability insurance.\n\nBezos was mindful of the safety issues, telling \u201c60 Minutes\u201d back in 2013, \u201cThis thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head while they're walking around their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from predicting that drones fed with GPS coordinates would be taking off and making deliveries in \u201cfour, five years. I think so. It will work, and it will happen.\u201d\n\nTo Perlman, the billionaire\u2019s optimism made perfect sense.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in his world you think more about technology than regulations, and the (drone) technology is there,\u201d Perlman said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Make Doctors Better?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/can-artificial-intelligence-make-doctors-better/4682459.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Teacher Rishi Rawat has one student who is not human, but a machine.\n\nLessons take place at a lab inside the University of Southern California\u2019s (USC) Clinical Science Center in Los Angeles, where Rawat teaches artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nTo help the machine learn, Rawat feeds the computer samples of cancer cells.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a computer brain, and you can put the data into them and they will learn the patterns and the pattern recognition that\u2019s important to making decisions,\u201d he explained.\n\nAI may soon be a useful tool in health care and allow doctors to understand biology and diagnose disease in ways that were never humanly possible.\n\n\u200bDoctors not going away\n\n\u201cMachines are not going to take the place of doctors. Computers will not treat patients, but they will help make certain decisions and look for things that the human brain can\u2019t recognize these patterns by itself,\u201d said David Agus, USC\u2019s professor of medicine and biomedical engineering, director at the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, and director at the university\u2019s Center for Applied Molecular Medicine.\n\nRawat is part of a team of interdisciplinary scientists at USC who are researching how AI and machine learning can identify complex patterns in cells and more accurately identify specific types of breast cancer tumors.\n\nOnce a confirmed cancerous tumor is removed, doctors still have to treat the patient to reduce the risk of recurrence. The type of treatment depends on the type of cancer and whether the tumor is driven by estrogen. Currently, pathologists would take a thin piece of tissue, put it on a slide, and stain with color to better see the cells.\n\n\u201cWhat the pathologist has to do is to count what percentage of the cells are brown and what percentage are not,\u201d said Dan Ruderman, a physicist who is also assistant professor of research medicine at USC.\n\nThe process could take days or even longer. Scientists say artificial intelligence can do something better than just count cells. Through machine learning, it can recognize complicated patterns on how the cells are arranged, with the hope, in the near future of making a quick and more reliable diagnosis that is free of human error.\n\n\u201cAre they disordered? Are they in a regular spacing? What\u2019s going on exactly with the arrangement of the cells in the tissue,\u201d described Ruderman of the types of patterns a machine can detect.\n\n\u201cWe could do this instantaneously for almost no cost in the developing world,\u201d Agus said.\n\n\u200bComputing power improves\n\nScientists say the time is ripe for the marriage between computer science and cancer research.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, we have the computing power to really do it in real time. We have the ability of scanning a slide to high enough resolution so that the computer can see every little feature of the cancer. So it\u2019s a convergence of technology. We couldn\u2019t have done this, we didn\u2019t have the computing power to do this several years ago,\u201d Agus said.\n\nData is key to having a machine effectively do its job in medicine.\n\n\u201cOnce you start to pool together tens and hundreds of thousands of patients and that data, you can actually [have] remarkable new insight, and so AI and machine learning is allowing that. It\u2019s enabling us to go to the next level in medicine and really take that art to new heights,\u201d Agus said.\n\nBack at the lab, Rawat is not only feeding the computer more cell samples, he also designs and writes code to ensure that the algorithm has the ability to learn features unique to cancer cells.\n\nThe research now is on breast cancer, but doctors predict artificial intelligence will eventually make a difference in all forms of cancer and beyond."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Help Doctors Make Better Decisions?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/can-artificial-intelligence-help-doctors-make-better-decisions/4682331.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, doctors may soon have new ways of diagnosing and treating patients in ways that were never humanly possible.

A Target breach in 2013 affected more than 41 million payment card accounts and exposed contact information for more than 60 million customers.\n\nEspecially sensitive data\n\nBut the target here \u2014 hotels where high-stakes business deals, romantic trysts and espionage are daily currency \u2014 makes the data gathered especially sensitive.\n\nJesse Varsalone, a University of Maryland cybersecurity expert, said the affected reservation system could be extremely enticing to nation-state spies interested in the travels of military and senior government officials.\n\n\u201cThere are just so many things you can extrapolate from people staying at hotels,\u201d Varsalone said.\n\nAnd because the data included reservations for future stays, along with home addresses, burglars could learn when someone wouldn\u2019t be home, said Scott Grissom of LegalShield, a provider of legal services.\n\nStarwood brand hotels\n\nThe affected hotel brands were operated by Starwood before it was acquired by Marriott in 2016. They include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, The Luxury Collection, Le Meridien and Four Points. Starwood-branded timeshare properties were also affected. None of the Marriott-branded chains were threatened.\n\nEmail notifications for those who may have been affected begin rolling out Friday and the full scope of the breach was not immediately clear.\n\nMarriott was trying to determine if the purloined records included duplicates, such as a single person staying multiple times.\n\nBreach undetected for a while\n\nSecurity analysts were especially alarmed to learn of the breach\u2019s undetected longevity. Marriott said it first detected it Sept. 8 but was unable to determine until last week what data had possibly been exposed because the thieves used encryption to remove it in order to avoid detection.\n\nMarriott said it did not yet know how many credit card numbers might have been stolen. A spokeswoman said Saturday that it was not yet able to respond to questions such as whether the intrusion and data theft was committed by a single or multiple groups.\n\nCybersecurity expert Andrei Barysevich of Recorded Future said Saturday he believed the breach was financially motivated.\n\nThe cybercrime gang expert in credit card theft such as the eastern European group known as Fin7 could be a suspect, he said, noting that a dark web credit card vendor recently announced that 2.6 million cards stolen from an unnamed hotel chain would soon be available to the online criminal underworld.\n\n\u201cWe will have to wait until an official forensic report, although, Marriott may never share their findings openly,\u201d he said.\n\nMarriott said the stolen credit card information was encrypted but the hackers may have obtained the \u201ctwo components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers.\u201d It said it cannot \u201crule out the possibility that both were taken.\u201d\n\nPrivacy laws\n\nFor as many as two-thirds of those affected, the exposed data could include mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers. Also dates of birth, gender, reservation dates, arrival and departure times and Starwood Preferred Guest account information.\n\nThe breach of personal information could put Marriott in violation of new European privacy laws, as guests included European travelers.\n\nMarriott set up a website and call center for customers who believe they are at risk.\n\nThe FBI said anyone contacted by Marriott should \u201ctake steps to monitor and safeguard their personally identifiable information and report any suspected instances of identity theft to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.\u201d\n\nPassport numbers have previously been part of a hack, though it\u2019s not common. They were among records on 9.4 million passengers of Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific obtained in a breach announced in October.\n\nCombined with names, addresses and other personal information, passport numbers are a greater concern than stolen credit card numbers because thieves could use them to open fraudulent accounts, said analyst Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com.\n\nHotels long a source of information\n\nThe data purloining highlights just how dangerous hotels can be for people worried about their privacy.\n\n\u201cHotels have long been important government sources of local information for tracking foreigners: reservation systems and loyalty programs took the surveillance global and made it easier for us to give up our privacy,\u201d said Colin Bastable, CEO of Lucy Security.\n\nIntelligence agencies including the U.S. National Security are well plugged into the global travel industry \u201cby fair means or foul,\u201d he said, nongovernment cybercriminals now have the same hacking tools.\n\n\u201cConsumers have become collateral damage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are all consumers.\u201d He advises providing hotels with as little information as possible when making reservations and checking in.\n\nLast year, the cybersecurity firm FireEye highlighted an effort in which Russian state agents allegedly tried to infiltrate the reservation systems of hotels in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n21 million Starwood program members\n\nWhen its acquisition by Marriott was first announced in 2015, Starwood had 21 million people in its loyalty program.

Microsoft surpassed Apple briefly a few times this week, but didn't close on top until Friday, with a market value of $851 billion to Apple's $847 billion. Microsoft hadn't been at the top since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.\n\nApple's plunge\n\n\n\nMicrosoft became a contender again in large part because Apple's stock fell nearly 20 percent in November, while Microsoft hasn't done any worse than the rest of the stock market. But the fact that it hasn't done poorly reflects its steady focus on business customers in recent years.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft lost its luster as people were shunning PCs in favor of smartphones. In 2013, PC sales plunged 10 percent to about 315 million, the worst year-to-year drop ever, according to research firms Gartner and IDC. It didn't help that Microsoft's effort to make PCs more like phones, Windows 8, was widely panned.\n\n\n\nBut a turnaround began when the Redmond, Wash., company promoted Nadella as CEO in 2014. He succeeded Microsoft's longtime CEO, Steve Ballmer, who initially scoffed at the notion that people would be willing to pay $500 or more for Apple's iPhones.\n\nThat bet paid off. Windows is now a dwindling fraction of Microsoft's business. While the company still runs consumer-focused businesses such as Bing search and Xbox gaming, it has prioritized business-oriented services such as its Office line of email and other workplace software, as well as newer additions such as LinkedIn and Skype. But its biggest growth has happened in the cloud, particularly the cloud platform it calls Azure. Cloud computing now accounts for more than a quarter of Microsoft's revenue, and Microsoft rivals Amazon as a leading provider of such services.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said Azure is still in its early days, meaning there's plenty of room for growth, especially considering the company's large customer base for Office and other products.\n\n\n\n\"While the tech carnage seen over the last month has been brutal, shares of [Microsoft] continue to hold up like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' he said.\n\n\n\nBeing less reliant on consumer demand helped shield Microsoft from holiday season turbulence and U.S.-China trade war jitters affecting Apple and other tech companies.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump amplified those tariff concerns when he told The Wall Street Journal in a story published late Monday that new tariffs could affect iPhones and laptops imported from China.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone maker had already seen its stock fall after reporting a mixed bag of quarterly results in early November amid fears about how the technology industry will fare in the face of such threats as rising interest rates, increased government regulation and Trump's escalating trade war with China.\n\nReporting change\n\n\n\nApple also spooked investors with an unexpected decision to stop disclosing how many iPhones it sells each quarter. That move has been widely interpreted as a sign that Apple foresees further declines in iPhone sales and is trying to mask that.\n\n\n\nWhile smartphones caused the downturn in personal computers years ago, sales of smartphones themselves have now stalled. That's partly because with fewer innovations from previous models, more people choose to hold on to the devices for longer periods before upgrading.\n\n\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust, said Microsoft is outperforming its tech rivals in part because of what it's not.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who demanded the briefing with Haspel, said there was \u201czero chance\u201d the crown prince wasn\u2019t involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a smoking gun. There\u2019s a smoking saw,\u201d Graham said, referring to reports from the Turkish government that said Saudi agents had used a bone saw to dismember Khashoggi after he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. \u201cYou have to be willfully blind\u201d not to conclude that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the crown prince\u2019s command, Graham said.\n\nTrump has equivocated over who is to blame for the killing, frustrating senators who are now looking for ways to punish the longtime Middle East ally. The Senate overwhelmingly voted last week to move forward on a resolution curtailing U.S. backing for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or how that resolution will move forward. The vote last week allowed the Senate to debate the measure, which could happen as soon as next week, but senators are still in negotiations on whether to amend it and what it should say.\n\nHaspel met with a small group of senators, including leadership and the chairmen and top Democrats on the key national security committees, after senators in both parties complained that she didn\u2019t attend an all-Senate briefing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last week.\n\nPompeo and Mattis tried to dissuade senators from punishing Saudi Arabia with the resolution, saying U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict is central to the Trump administration\u2019s broader goal of containing Iranian influence in the Middle East. Human rights groups say the war is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate bombing.\n\nThe two men also echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance to blame the crown prince. Pompeo said there was \u201cno direct reporting\u201d connecting the crown prince to the murder, and Mattis said there was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d making the connection.\n\nAfter that briefing, Graham threatened to withhold his vote on key legislation until he heard from Haspel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow past this,\u201d Graham said. That afternoon, senators frustrated with the briefing and the lack of response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing overwhelmingly voted to move forward with consideration of the Yemen resolution, 63-37.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said the briefing with Haspel \u201cclearly went in to an evaluation of the intelligence\u201d and was much more informative than the session with Mattis and Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI went in believing the crown prince was directly responsible or at least complicit in this and my feelings were strengthened by the information we were given,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nDurbin joined Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a full-Senate briefing from Haspel.\n\n\u201cEvery senator should hear what I heard this afternoon,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a critic of Saudi Arabia, said that excluding some lawmakers was \u201cthe very definition of the deep state\u201d and that he suspected that the Trump administration was attempting to get some lawmakers to switch their votes on the resolution by giving them information.\n\nKhashoggi was killed two months ago. The journalist, who had lived for a time in the U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi regime. He was killed in what U.S. officials have described as an elaborate plot as he visited the consulate for marriage paperwork.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known of the plot, but Trump has been reluctant to pin the blame.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\u201d Trump said in a lengthy statement Nov. 20. \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe president has touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. and recently thanked Saudi Arabia for plunging oil prices.\n\n\u201cThey have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s long relationship with Saudi Arabia, senators have said the murder can\u2019t be excused.\n\nIn a column for the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Graham wrote that the killing and other moves by the Saudi regime showed \u201castounding arrogance entitlement\u201d and disregard for international norms.\n\n\u201cWe are a co-equal branch of government exercising leadership to safeguard the country\u2019s long-term interests, values and reputation,\u201d wrote Graham, a frequent ally of the president, of the Senate. \u201cAfter all, someone\u2019s got to do it.\u201d\n\nGraham said after the briefing that he would push for a nonbinding resolution that the crown prince was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Graham and Paul have also said they think Congress should block a pending arms deal with the kingdom.\n\nCorker said senators were trying to figure out how to amend the resolution, which directs the president to remove most U.S. armed forces from hostilities affecting Yemen. He said finding a compromise would be difficult because some lawmakers didn\u2019t want to tie Yemen to the Khashoggi killing.\n\nSenators are \u201ctrying to figure out an amendment that a larger group of people could get behind that addresses this issue without undermining our national interests,\u201d Corker said.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said after the briefing that somebody should be punished.\n\n\u201cNow, the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation itself,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Senate passage of a resolution would send a strong message to Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s unlikely it would become law before the end of the year. The House hasn\u2019t moved on the issue, and Speaker Paul Ryan last week said the Yemen resolution \u201cisn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "World's First Baby Born Via Uterus Transplant From Deceased Donor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-womb-transplant-deceased-donor_us_5c075918e4b0680a7eca227c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Handout/Reuters A medical team at Brazil\u2019s Sao Paulo University hospital holds the first baby born via uterus transplant from a deceased donor on December 15, 2017.\n\nLONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) \u2015 A woman in Brazil who received a womb transplanted from a deceased donor has given birth to a baby girl in the first successful case of its kind, doctors reported.\n\nThe case, published in The Lancet medical journal, involved connecting veins from the donor uterus with the recipient\u2019s veins, as well as linking arteries, ligaments and vaginal canals.\n\nIt comes after 10 previously known cases of uterus transplants from deceased donors \u2015 in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey \u2015 failed to produce a live birth.\n\nThe girl born in the Brazilian case was delivered via cesarean section at 35 weeks and three days, and weighed nearly 6 lbs, the case study said.\n\nDani Ejzenberg, a doctor at Brazil\u2019s Sao Paulo University hospital who led the research, said the transplant \u2015 carried out in September 2016 when the recipient was 32 \u2015 shows the technique is feasible and could offer women with uterine infertility access to a larger pool of potential donors.\n\nThe current norm for receiving a womb transplant is that the organ would come from a live family member willing to donate it.\n\n\u201cThe numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population,\u201d Ejzenberg said in a statement about the results.\n\nShe added, however, that the outcomes and effects of womb donations from live and deceased donors have yet to be compared, and said the technique could still be refined and optimized.\n\nThe first baby born after a live donor womb transplant was in Sweden in 2013. Scientists have so far reported a total of 39 procedures of this kind, resulting in 11 live births.\n\nExperts estimate that infertility affects around 10 to 15 percent of couples of reproductive age worldwide. Of this group, around one in 500 women have uterine problems.\n\nBefore uterus transplants became possible, the only options to have a child were adoption or surrogacy.\n\nIn the Brazilian case, the recipient had been born without a uterus due to a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome. The donor was 45 and died of a stroke.\n\nFive months after the transplant, Ejzenberg\u2019s team wrote, the uterus showed no signs of rejection, ultrasound scans were normal, and the recipient was having regular menstruation. The woman\u2019s previously fertilized and frozen eggs were implanted after seven months and 10 days later she was confirmed pregnant."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "This Professor Teaches Journalism At A Top UK University.

An extensive investigation by the The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Government science laboratory, debunked many of these claims in 2005.\n\nIn his review, Robinson calls the book \u201ca serious challenge for mainstream academics and journalists to start to ask substantial questions about 9/11\u2033 in order to \u201csearch for the facts and speak truth to power\u201d.\n\nRobinson also provided a quote for the back cover of the book, writing: \u201c9/11 Unmasked provides an authoritative and carefully argued exposition of key problems with the official narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by HuffPost UK if he agrees with the conclusions of 9/11 Unmasked, Robinson said in an email: \u201cMy position, as has been the case for some time, is that [conclusions detailed in 9/11 Unmasked] demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that significant parts of the official narrative are very likely to be incorrect.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer tenable for academics and journalists to avoid asking probing questions about the possible involvement of state actors in the 9/11 attacks. 9/11 requires further analysis and investigation and this is a position I share with many other academics.\u201d\n\nRobinson also suggested a number of other academics whose work would allow readers to \u201cget up to speed with geo-politics and the current dynamics of the international system\u201d, one of whom was Kees van der Pijl, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex.\n\nEarlier this month van der Pijl tweeted: \u201cNot Saudis, Israelis blew up Twin Towers with help from Zionists in US govt.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nLydia Wilson, an Oxford and Cambridge research fellow and editor of the Cambridge Literary Review, said this raises serious questions for the University of Sheffield.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that Piers Robinson is teaching propaganda,\u201d she told HuffPost UK. \u201cThe most troubling thing for me is how did he get this job? It\u2019s not hard to uncover this man.\n\n\u2033[The review of 9/11 Unmasked] is conspiracy-theory driven. There\u2019s no academic who should write a post like \u2013 there\u2019s no argument and there\u2019s no evidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to students \u2013 he\u2019s working in a journalism department and he can\u2019t analyse journalism sources.\u201d\n\nRobinson has taught at the University of Sheffield since last year, HuffPost UK understands that his inaugural lecture to students in October 2017 was based on a paper he published around the same time, titled \u201cLearning from the Chilcot report: Propaganda, deception and the \u2019War on Terror\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis paper argues that the ongoing conflict in Syria, which began in 2011, is not the result of the popular uprising known as the Arab Spring, but is in fact the \u201cconsequence\u201d of policies made by former leaders George Bush and Tony Blair in reaction to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYes, ignorance of the larger picture: Syria is just one regime change in a series initiated after 9/11. Read the article, or Chilcot 3.1 \u2014 Piers Robinson (@PiersRobinson1) July 5, 2017\n\nRobinson uses a number of quotes from the Chilcot Report \u2013 the public inquiry into the origins of the Iraq War, which was published in 2017 \u2013 and other sources, to make the case that the current war in Syria is part of a regime-change plot by western governments, supported by an extensive propaganda campaign aimed at the public.\n\nIn one instance during his lecture and paper, he quotes Blair as saying \u201cthe Middle east is set for catastrophe\u201d as \u201cindicative evidence\u201d the former prime minister knew the region would be embroiled in \u201cbig and significant\u201d western-backed conflict a decade later.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson stood by his interpretation, saying: \u201cRemember Blair and Bush are planning the overthrow of Saddam [Hussein] in these documents plus discussing when to \u2018hit\u2019 Iran and Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the next page of the Chilcot Report, which he does not show to his students, shows Blair was actually discussing offering Iran and Syria \u201chelp and support in building a new partnership with the West\u201d.\n\nDr Yasser Munif, a Lebanese expert on middle eastern politics and society at Emerson College, Boston, told HuffPost UK: \u201cRobinson and people like him are trying to transpose what happened in the Iraq War onto what\u2019s happening with the Arab uprisings of 2011.\n\n\u201cOne of the major problems with his thinking is he completely denies the agency of the Arab population, perceives anything happening in the region as a form of conspiracy.\n\n\u201cHe thinks Arabs have to be manipulated and funded and told exactly what to do \u2013 it\u2019s completely insulting.\u201d\n\nA major part of Robinson\u2019s case for arguing the Syrian war is part of a western regime plot, is a quote from US General Wesley Clark, made in 2006.\n\nAt the time, he described a 2001 encounter with a Pentagon official who alluded to a plan to \u201ctake out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off with Iraq\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson claims in his lecture and paper that General Clark was \u201cwas more or less right on the money\u201d and says it is further evidence the conflict in Syria began as part of a western regime change plot.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK spoke to General Clark and informed him of how Robinson was using his quote, he said: \u201cTell him to stop \u2013 the document was written in 2001 so I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Syria in 2011.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t a western regime-change issue.\u201d\n\nRobinson also uses another quote in both his lecture and paper, from a speech by the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove.\n\nSpeaking at the Rusi think-tank in 2014, he describes a pre-9/11 conversation with Saudi Prince Bandar, who told him: \u201cThe time is not far off, Richard, in the Middle East when it will literally be God help the Shia, more than 69 million Sunnis have simply had enough of them\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson presents this as further evidence the middle east will be hit by a series of western-backed wars.\n\nBut the next part of Dearlove\u2019s speech, which Robinson does not play to his students, makes clear he is talking about possible Saudi funding for Islamic State, not regime change, as explained by journalist Patrick Cockburn.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK informed Dearlove of how Robinson was using his quote, he told us: \u201d[He] is wildly misinterpreting me.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural lecture to journalism students, HuffPost UK has also learned that Robinson claims the infamous \u201cMISSION ACCOMPLISHED\u201d banner that hung behind George W Bush when he made his speech declaring the Iraq War over in 2003 was \u201cwas actually imposed over, it wasn\u2019t actually there\u201d.\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson elaborated saying he believed it was \u201cimposed via computer programming overlay in real time, like they do with adverts at football matches and so on\u201d.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Robinson says the banner \"imposed via computer programming overlay\".\n\nRobinson is also a public speaker and regularly shares a stage with and promotes the work of:\n\nMedia on Trial Promotional material from a \"Media on Trial\" event held in London last year.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who demanded the briefing with Haspel, said there was \u201czero chance\u201d the crown prince wasn\u2019t involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a smoking gun. There\u2019s a smoking saw,\u201d Graham said, referring to reports from the Turkish government that said Saudi agents had used a bone saw to dismember Khashoggi after he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. \u201cYou have to be willfully blind\u201d not to conclude that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the crown prince\u2019s command, Graham said.\n\nTrump has equivocated over who is to blame for the killing, frustrating senators who are now looking for ways to punish the longtime Middle East ally. The Senate overwhelmingly voted last week to move forward on a resolution curtailing U.S. backing for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether or how that resolution will move forward. The vote last week allowed the Senate to debate the measure, which could happen as soon as next week, but senators are still in negotiations on whether to amend it and what it should say.\n\nHaspel met with a small group of senators, including leadership and the chairmen and top Democrats on the key national security committees, after senators in both parties complained that she didn\u2019t attend an all-Senate briefing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last week.\n\nPompeo and Mattis tried to dissuade senators from punishing Saudi Arabia with the resolution, saying U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict is central to the Trump administration\u2019s broader goal of containing Iranian influence in the Middle East. Human rights groups say the war is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate bombing.\n\nThe two men also echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance to blame the crown prince. Pompeo said there was \u201cno direct reporting\u201d connecting the crown prince to the murder, and Mattis said there was \u201cno smoking gun\u201d making the connection.\n\nAfter that briefing, Graham threatened to withhold his vote on key legislation until he heard from Haspel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow past this,\u201d Graham said. That afternoon, senators frustrated with the briefing and the lack of response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing overwhelmingly voted to move forward with consideration of the Yemen resolution, 63-37.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said the briefing with Haspel \u201cclearly went in to an evaluation of the intelligence\u201d and was much more informative than the session with Mattis and Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI went in believing the crown prince was directly responsible or at least complicit in this and my feelings were strengthened by the information we were given,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nDurbin joined Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in calling for a full-Senate briefing from Haspel.\n\n\u201cEvery senator should hear what I heard this afternoon,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a critic of Saudi Arabia, said that excluding some lawmakers was \u201cthe very definition of the deep state\u201d and that he suspected that the Trump administration was attempting to get some lawmakers to switch their votes on the resolution by giving them information.\n\nKhashoggi was killed two months ago. The journalist, who had lived for a time in the U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi regime. He was killed in what U.S. officials have described as an elaborate plot as he visited the consulate for marriage paperwork.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known of the plot, but Trump has been reluctant to pin the blame.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,\u201d Trump said in a lengthy statement Nov. 20. \u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe president has touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. and recently thanked Saudi Arabia for plunging oil prices.\n\n\u201cThey have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s long relationship with Saudi Arabia, senators have said the murder can\u2019t be excused.\n\nIn a column for the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Graham wrote that the killing and other moves by the Saudi regime showed \u201castounding arrogance entitlement\u201d and disregard for international norms.\n\n\u201cWe are a co-equal branch of government exercising leadership to safeguard the country\u2019s long-term interests, values and reputation,\u201d wrote Graham, a frequent ally of the president, of the Senate. \u201cAfter all, someone\u2019s got to do it.\u201d\n\nGraham said after the briefing that he would push for a nonbinding resolution that the crown prince was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Graham and Paul have also said they think Congress should block a pending arms deal with the kingdom.\n\nCorker said senators were trying to figure out how to amend the resolution, which directs the president to remove most U.S. armed forces from hostilities affecting Yemen. He said finding a compromise would be difficult because some lawmakers didn\u2019t want to tie Yemen to the Khashoggi killing.\n\nSenators are \u201ctrying to figure out an amendment that a larger group of people could get behind that addresses this issue without undermining our national interests,\u201d Corker said.\n\nSen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said after the briefing that somebody should be punished.\n\n\u201cNow, the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation itself,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Senate passage of a resolution would send a strong message to Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s unlikely it would become law before the end of the year. The House hasn\u2019t moved on the issue, and Speaker Paul Ryan last week said the Yemen resolution \u201cisn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Mueller: Michael Flynn Cooperated In Russia Probe, Shouldn't Serve Prison Time", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mueller-michael-flynn-sentence-memo_us_5c06e7cbe4b0fc236110b7a1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has offered extensive cooperation in the Russia investigation and shouldn\u2019t spend any time in prison, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team said in a court filing on Tuesday.\n\nMueller\u2019s team, in two memos filed ahead of Flynn\u2019s Dec. 18 sentencing, said that Flynn participated in 19 interviews with the special counsel or other Justice Department officers and provided documents and communications.

Flynn had denied that he\u2019d asked the Russian ambassador not to retaliate over U.S. sanctions the Obama administration imposed in December 2016 in response to Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nFlynn admitted in his plea that he spoke to the Russians at the direction of Trump transition team officials.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFlynn has played an outsized role in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He had attended a 2015 gala in honor of RT \u2015 the Moscow-controlled news station formerly known as Russia Today that later registered as a foreign agent of Russia \u2015 where he sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Flynn lied to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia in the beginning days of the Trump administration, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned top Trump administration officials that Flynn was \u201ccompromised\u201d and \u201ccould essentially be blackmailed\u201d by the Russians. But Flynn refused to resign for weeks.\n\nFlynn\u2019s name remained relevant to the Russia inquiry even after his firing. In a contemporaneous memo documenting his interaction with the president, former FBI Director James Comey said Trump expressed hope Comey could \u201csee your way clear to letting this go,\u201d referring to the agency\u2019s investigation of Flynn, and called Flynn a \u201cgood guy.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, claimed earlier this year that such a conversation never took place, but also said \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u201d if it did.\n\nOn Tuesday, Giuliani downplayed the significance of the filing on Flynn, Politico reported.\n\n\u201cWow big crime for a SPECIAL WHATEVER,\u201d Giuliani wrote in a text message to the outlet. \u201cmaybe a group of Angry Bitter Hillary Supporters who are justifying themselves by the goal justifies the means....\u201d\n\nAfter his firing, Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent for work his firm did for a Turkish company. A subsequently released financial disclosure report also revealed that Flynn received speaking fees from two other Russian firms in addition to RT.\n\nThe new filing follows a whirlwind week for Mueller\u2019s team. After receiving heavily vetted written answers from President Donald Trump on a wide variety of topics, Mueller\u2019s team last week accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of breaking his plea deal by lying and extracted another guilty plea from former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to a fresh charge of lying to Congress about talks between the Trump Organization and Russia about a potential Trump Tower in Moscow.\n\nFormer Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos also reported to federal prison last Monday to serve a two-week sentence after a judge shut down his last-minute attempt to back out of a plea deal, while conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi \u2015 who was in plea negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team \u2015 made public a document that outlined Mueller\u2019s theory of contacts between Corsi, Trump associate Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nYahoo News reported this week that Mueller\u2019s team is \u201ctying up loose ends\u201d in the investigation and preparing to bring the probe, which began in May 2017, to a close.\n\nThis article has been updated with comment posted by Rudy Giuliani."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Roger Stone Refuses To Provide Documents, Interview With Judiciary Committee: Lawyer", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-wont-provide-documents-or-interview-with-judiciary-committee-lawyer-says_us_5c06f5abe4b0a6e4ebd94e47", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Roger Stone, a longtime associate and friend of President Donald Trump, said through his lawyer Tuesday that he would not cooperate with the Senate Judiciary\u2019s request for documents or an interview.\n\nStone also declined to provide lawmakers with documents related to \u201ccommunications related to hacked emails, communications with Russian hackers of Wikileaks, and communications with the Trump campaign,\u201d during the 2016 presidential election, a request that Sen.

Deval Patrick departing the statehouse in Boston at the end of his last term, Jan. 7, 2015. His tenure at a subprime mortgage lender raises serious questions about his role at other scandal-plagued corporations.\n\nWhen Deval Patrick\u2019s daughter was growing up in the 1980s, her kindergarten teacher gave her an assignment: Go home and describe the four seasons to your mom and dad. So she did: \u201cFirst you drive up and the doorman takes your car.\u201d For the daughter of a Boston power lawyer, the Four Seasons Hotel seemed as sensible a homework topic as the basics on winter, spring, summer and fall.\n\nPatrick loves this joke. He has been telling it to audiences since at least 2007. It\u2019s in his memoir, it pops up in radio interviews, and this fall he deployed it to charm a crowd at a Washington think tank. The key to the story isn\u2019t his easy smile but who he is. Coming from Mitt Romney, the same narrative would be a crass celebration of inherited wealth. But from a black man who can remember his mother cashing welfare checks on the South Side of Chicago, it\u2019s inspirational stuff \u2015 a symbol, as Patrick says, of what makes America an exceptional country.\n\nWhich makes Patrick, a Democrat, an extremely effective messenger for a fundamentally conservative idea. \u201cWhat I feel we often describe as income inequality is a shorthand for economic mobility,\u201d he told that think tank crowd. \u201cThe ability to move from where you are to where you want to be \u2015 that is the source of continuing anxiety, notwithstanding what the statistics say about the strength of the economy.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t true, of course. Economic mobility and income inequality aren\u2019t interchangeable concepts, and people don\u2019t really get them mixed up. In 2012, Romney\u2019s soon-to-be running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), made the difference between the two ideas a key distinction between the Republican ticket and the vision of President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a decision in this country,\u201d Ryan told a right-wing radio host. Republicans wanted to \u201ccelebrate the right to rise\u201d by \u201cprotecting equal opportunities,\u201d while Democrats, Ryan said, \u201csaw the government\u2019s role\u201d as \u201cequalizing the outcome of our lives.\u201d\n\nBut as the Democratic Party prepares for the 2020 primaries, Patrick\u2019s message is receiving a powerful signal boost from none other than Obama himself. The two men have more in common than a Chicago connection. Both attended prep school on scholarships, and both earned Harvard Law degrees before beginning careers as civil rights attorneys. During his 2008 presidential run, Obama even cribbed some rhetoric on the stump from speeches Patrick gave during his 2006 gubernatorial race. Today much of the 44th president\u2019s inner circle is promoting Patrick at elite gatherings. And while Patrick hasn\u2019t made anything official, his friends launched a political action committee in August, allowing his team to start courting donors ahead of 2020.\n\nPatrick has plenty of political assets \u2015 an understated sense of humor and the experience of two terms as governor of Massachusetts among them. But the support from Obama is the chief reason Patrick is being mentioned as a top 2020 contender in the Democratic Party. And it might be best if Democrats didn\u2019t go hunting for other reasons. Told from a different angle, Patrick\u2019s biography isn\u2019t an uplifting rags-to-riches story but an ugly tale of corruption among the American power elite. Patrick didn\u2019t just make a lot of money; he made a lot of money helping a Republican billionaire rip off the black middle class.\n\nTold from a different angle, Deval Patrick\u2019s biography isn\u2019t an uplifting rags-to-riches story but an ugly tale of corruption among the American power elite.\n\nIn 2005, President George W. Bush nominated Republican Party megadonor Roland Arnall to serve as ambassador to the Netherlands. Arnall, his wife and the companies they controlled were the biggest contributors to Bush over the previous three years, spending over $1 million on his second inauguration alone. Ambassadorships are frequently dispensed to big donors, but Arnall had no diplomatic experience. Even his business was a domestic affair. The appointment looked bad enough that a few senators, including a newcomer from Illinois named Barack Obama, cried foul.\n\nBut Arnall got some support from an unlikely source. Patrick and Arnall got to know each other in 1996, when Patrick helmed the civil rights division at the Department of Justice. Arnall was running Long Beach Mortgage Co., which the DOJ was investigating for racial discrimination in the subprime lending market. The DOJ and Long Beach eventually reached a $4 million settlement. The idea was to send a message to subprime lenders about some of their shadier practices without crimping the flow of credit into the still-developing sector. \u201cWe recognize that lenders understand the industry in ways we don\u2019t,\u201d Patrick said at the time. \u201cThat is why there is so much flexibility in the decree.\u201d\n\nWhen Arnall came up for the ambassadorship, Patrick wrote to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to heap praise on Arnall. The billionaire was \u201ca good man,\u201d Patrick wrote, and Arnall\u2019s Ameriquest was \u201ca good company.\u201d Arnall had \u201creally stepped forward\u201d after the settlement in the 1990s. \u201cHe used the experience to make a better company\u201d and would make a \u201cfine ambassador.\u201d\n\nAmeriquest\u2019s business model used high-pressure sales techniques to push homeowners with existing mortgages into new loans with sky-high interest rates. If the family couldn\u2019t pay, investors who bought the loans would acquire the house through foreclosure. When home prices were soaring during the housing bubble, it was a tremendously profitable strategy, turning Arnall into a billionaire.\n\nBut Ameriquest was a financial time bomb targeting middle-class families, particularly families of color. There is no nationwide database on Ameriquest\u2019s lending that sorts by race, but we can get a look at the company\u2019s general operations by looking at individual cities. In Milwaukee \u201cnearly all\u201d Ameriquest loans issued from 2003 to 2005 were refinancings, according to data from the University of Wisconsin, and half of them were made to households making less than $50,000 a year, with more than a third going to inner-city neighborhoods covered by the federal government\u2019s Community Development Block Grant Program. In Detroit the company was responsible for over 2,500 foreclosures, 70 percent of them on homes that were blighted or abandoned by 2015, according to The Detroit News. A 2010 study by researchers at Ohio State University found that Ameriquest disproportionately targeted black neighborhoods in Minneapolis.\n\nAnd Patrick was making $360,000 a year working for Ameriquest. He joined the company\u2019s board in 2004, lending his credibility as a former civil rights attorney to both the company\u2019s operations and the public image of its founder. Two months after Patrick vouched for Arnall to the Senate, Ameriquest agreed to pay $325 million to settle predatory lending allegations in 49 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nWhen the mortgage business began to implode, Patrick left Ameriquest to run for governor of Massachusetts. Though his corporate background generated plenty of controversy in the primary \u2015 he pointedly refused to release his tax returns during the campaign \u2015 he entered office in 2007 as Ameriquest was collapsing. Patrick called Citigroup executive Robert Rubin to plead for funding to rescue the dying firm, using the weight of the governorship to quite literally call in a favor for a Republican billionaire.\n\nIn a statement provided to HuffPost, Patrick spokesman Alex Goldstein described the former governor\u2019s Ameriquest tenure as a victory for progressive change.\n\n\u201cGovernor Patrick believes that real change cannot always be achieved from the outside, and sometimes requires us to bring our judgement and conscience inside to have an impact,\u201d Alex Goldstein wrote. \u201cIn 2004, he agreed to serve on the board of ACC Capital Holdings as the Board\u2019s internal liaison to Ameriquest management, helping to reach settlements with states seeking compensation for those harmed by Ameriquest\u2019s predatory lending practices. Governor Patrick served in this role as he has throughout his career \u2015 without leaving his conscience at the door.\u201d\n\nIf so, Patrick\u2019s tenure at Ameriquest raises serious questions about his role at other scandal-plagued corporations. He did some work on the mortgage settlement, and the details that have come to light \u2015 particularly in a book by former Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Hudson \u2015 implicate Patrick in the company\u2019s attempt to wine and dine its way out of liability.\n\nArnall introduced Patrick to a group of state attorneys general at a dinner he had arranged hoping to bring down the temperature of negotiations that would eventually end in the $325 million settlement. The pricey evening became an immediate government ethics debacle for the prosecutors \u2015 a transparent effort by Arnall and Patrick to buy off their adversaries with a night on the town. Public servants are generally barred from accepting gifts from corporations they are investigating for fraud. But Ameriquest insisted on taking care of the check, resulting in months of negotiations over how prosecutors would pay their tabs. Several ended up sending the company personal checks.\n\nIn corporate America, Patrick was not so much a reformer as he was a public relations figure.\n\nPatrick\u2019s personal line on government ethics issues has always been aggressive. His decision to work at a company he had been investigated for racially discriminatory lending was, even by Washington standards, an audacious turn through the revolving door. But the Ameriquest episode wasn\u2019t the first time he ran that particular routine.\n\nUnder Patrick\u2019s leadership in 1997, the DOJ signed a $176 million settlement with Texaco for racial discrimination against its employees. A year after a court approved the deal, he left the DOJ for a job as Texaco\u2019s top in-house attorney.\n\nFour years later, he left Texaco for Coca-Cola, which was trying to clean up its image after signing a $192 million racial discrimination settlement \u2015 the largest in history. The pattern was clear: Patrick was the guy you hired if your company needed to look serious about fixing high-profile racism.\n\nHe arrived at Coca-Cola as outrage was building over its practices in Colombia, where its bottling plants hired paramilitary forces to intimidate and murder employees in an effort to thwart union activity. By 2003, international labor unions were calling for a boycott of the company. Patrick\u2019s legacy with Coke is complex. He defended Coca-Cola against a lawsuit filed by labor unions over the violence, and when courts dismissed the case, he praised the result as \u201cthe right legal outcome.\u201d But in 2004 he pressed for an independent investigation of the death squad allegations as a check against Coca-Cola\u2019s own investigation. When the company\u2019s executives recoiled at the idea, he resigned.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t done taking Coke\u2019s money. He accepted $2.1 million in consulting work with Coke the year after he stepped down.\n\nProminent civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, have defended Patrick\u2019s work for Coca-Cola as substantive. But some companies can\u2019t be fixed from the inside. It\u2019s hard to imagine a Democratic politician boasting about her ability to boost wages at a tobacco giant, for instance. Patrick knew that Arnall ran a problem company in the 1990s and praised him as a sincere reformer even as his company was falling apart for again mass-producing foreclosures that disproportionately affected minority families. The good guys in 2005 weren\u2019t trying to score ambassadorships for Ameriquest\u2019s founder. They were trying to put him out of business.\n\n\u201cThe subprime market had evolved to the point where we needed to do anything we could to shut it down,\u201d says Prentiss Cox, currently a University of Minnesota Law School professor who worked on the states\u2019 settlement with Ameriquest and wanted to bring the case to court.\n\nIn corporate America, Patrick was not so much a reformer as he was a public relations figure. He gave corporations a story to tell about the good things they were supposedly doing \u2015 even if when they were simultaneously busying themselves with very bad things. By comparison, his tenure as governor of Massachusetts is pretty tame. His transgressions against progressive orthodoxy \u2015 securing $1 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, increasing sales taxes (a regressive change that hits the poor harder than other tax increases) by $1 billion, overruling state regulators to clear the way for Uber \u2015 never came close to threatening his re-election. He finished both terms with sky-high approval ratings.\n\nAfter leaving government, he accepted a job at Bain Capital, where he focuses on making investments in midmarket companies with high social and environmental impact."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "A Trump Appointee Hunted For Election Fraud.

Investigators are probing reports that a political operative working for Republicans ran an illegal ballot operation in the 9th District.\n\nA spokesman for Higdon\u2019s office said Monday they \u201ccannot confirm or deny any investigation\u201d into the alleged wrongdoings in the race between Harris and McCready.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office Robert Higdon Jr. is seen in an undated photo.\n\nState investigators in North Carolina, however, indicated they are working with the FBI and Higdon\u2019s office on the investigation into the alleged election improprieties. The Washington Post reported that Harris\u2019 28-year-old son John is an assistant U.S. attorney working under Higdon.\n\nNew evidence came to light Monday connecting suspicious absentee ballot activity in the Harris-McCready race to a political operative named Leslie McCrae Dowless. Dowless has a criminal history and has emerged at the center of the possible election fraud case. The conduct in question allegedly took place in Bladen County, which falls within the federal judicial Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nHigdon, who co-led the prosecution of former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) in a case involving campaign finance fraud, has more recently overseen the prosecution of a number of cases of voting by noncitizens. One conviction in that batch of cases, involving an Italian immigrant who\u2019d registered as a Republican, resulted in a $200 fine. Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias, who was fired during the George W. Bush administration after Republicans complained that he failed to bring enough voter fraud cases, told HuffPost that the episode was an example of \u201cthe type of de minimis case\u201d \u2015 that is, a case too minor to merit consideration \u2015 \u201cthat U.S. Attorneys almost never prosecute.\u201d\n\nHigdon\u2019s office also issued a broad subpoena request earlier this year for millions of voter registration applications and absentee ballots, which the North Carolina Board of Elections voted to quash. Under scrutiny, Higdon\u2019s office delayed the subpoenas until after November\u2019s election.\n\nElection officials are now investigating apparent irregularities with absentee ballots in the midterm race. In Bladen County, there appear to be an unusually high number of voters who requested ballots but never returned them. Bladen County is the only place in the district where Harris defeated McCready in absentee ballots.\n\nThe state Democratic Party submitted an affidavit from a man named Dwight Sheppard, who said he overheard a group of people saying Dowless would receive a $40,000 bonus if Harris won the race. In another affidavit, a man said he spoke to Dowless outside an early voting location earlier this year, and says Dowless told him he was doing absentee work for Harris.\n\nDowless was convicted of felony perjury and felony fraud in 1990 and 1992 respectively, according to The Charlotte Observer. He\u2019s worked on get-out-the-vote operations for a number of candidates over the last decade. As described in a 2016 episode of \u201cThis American Life,\u201d Dowless was at one point accused of running an illegal scheme that involved collecting absentee ballot forms and casting them on other people\u2019s behalf. The \u201cvolunteers\u201d working with Dowless were allegedly paid per ballot, and the case was referred to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Higdon was confirmed as U.S. Attorney several months later, in September 2017.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Mark Harris speaks to the media on Nov. 7, 2018.\n\nWSOC, a local television station, made another connection between Dowless and the apparent irregularities in the 9th District. A woman told the station that she collected absentee ballots from voters and then gave them to Dowless. In North Carolina, only the voter or a \u201cclose relative\u201d can return a ballot. The woman, Ginger Eason, told the station she didn\u2019t know what Dowless did with the ballots.\n\nWSOC and the website Popular Information published the names of eight witnesses who signed a high number of absentee ballots (North Carolina requires two witnesses for an absentee ballot). Eason is among that group and signed as a witness for 10 people.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement voted 7-2 Friday to hold a public evidentiary hearing on or before Dec. 21. Andy Penry, a Democrat and the board\u2019s chairman, resigned over the weekend after Republicans drew attention to tweets he\u2019d written that were critical of President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump speaks often of the need to crack down on supposed election irregularities, and has made the baseless claim that millions of votes from illegal immigrants gave former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton her popular vote victory over him in the 2016 election.

The donor was 45 and died of a stroke.\n\nFive months after the transplant, Ejzenberg\u2019s team wrote, the uterus showed no signs of rejection, ultrasound scans were normal, and the recipient was having regular menstruation.

Sales at marijuana dispensaries have created a tax revenue bonanza for the tiny town.\n\nBy Sophie Quinton\n\nGARDEN CITY, Colo. \u2014 This Saturday, tiny Garden City will throw a party to celebrate improvements to its main street. Officials will close a block to traffic and install an ice-skating rink in the middle of the road. There will be horse-drawn carriage rides. There will be hot toddies. And there\u2019ll be three blocks of new sidewalks, crosswalks, benches and trees to show off to the public.\n\nGarden City isn\u2019t much of a city; it\u2019s smaller than a square mile and has fewer than 300 residents. But it could afford to spend $3 million on downtown infrastructure upgrades thanks to its four bustling marijuana retailers.\n\nBefore the first medical marijuana dispensary in town opened in 2009, Garden City collected about $360,000 in revenue each year, said longtime Town Administrator Cheryl Campbell. Now pot is legal for recreational use, too, and last year, the town raked in over $2 million from sales taxes alone \u2014 mostly from the sale of bud, pre-rolled joints, edibles and other pot products.\n\nThe marijuana boom hasn\u2019t had any downsides, Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a benefit to the community, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And I was anti-marijuana myself.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado and other states that let adults possess small amounts of marijuana, the lure of additional tax revenue has helped convince many towns and counties to welcome pot shops. Here in conservative-leaning Weld County, where most towns have said \u201cno\u201d to dispensaries, local officials are watching Garden City and wondering whether they should change their anti-pot stance.\n\nFor instance, although the 7,000-odd residents of Milliken in 2015 voted against licensing dispensaries, the town board last year decided to license a couple of retailers. \u201cObviously, the town board that approved that was hoping for revenue,\u201d Milliken Town Administrator Leonard Wiest said. \u201cThey saw what was happening in Garden City.\u201d\n\nSo far, he said, no marijuana retailers have opened, though one store is going through the building permit approval process.\n\nMarijuana tax revenue hasn\u2019t been quite as transformative in Colorado cities with larger tax bases, such as Denver and Boulder. And tax experts say it\u2019s risky for cities to lean too heavily on a single source of revenue \u2014 particularly one that\u2019s illegal at the federal level and vulnerable to a federal crackdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stream of revenue they should rely on for their major, long-term spending needs,\u201d said Katherine Loughead, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nThe Cannabis Boom\n\nGarden City has a history of embracing vice. It split off from the town of Greeley in the 1930s, after the larger town outlawed liquor manufacture and sales. In its early days, Garden City was the place where locals went to drink and party.\n\nThat history didn\u2019t inform the town council\u2019s decision to allow marijuana sales, Campbell said. But the comparison is inevitable. Today, Greeley, population 100,000, doesn\u2019t allow dispensaries, and Garden City is the go-to pot destination for Greeley residents as well as those of neighboring towns and rural areas as far away as Wyoming.\n\nThe city is so small that it only takes a few minutes to drive through it and enter Greeley, which surrounds the town on three sides. Three of Garden City\u2019s four dispensaries are tucked away off the main commercial strip, and it\u2019s easy to zoom through town without noticing them.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Workers tend to marijuana plants in a greenhouse at Nature\u2019s Herbs and Wellness Center, a dispensary in Garden City, Colorado. Marijuana has become the biggest employer in town.\n\nOn a recent November morning, a steady stream of people made their way into the recreational dispensary run by Nature\u2019s Herbs and Wellness Center. The shoppers ranged from neatly dressed hipsters and young men in camouflage-print hats to middle-aged women in hoodies, who joked with one another as they waited in line.\n\nThree \u201cbudtenders\u201d took orders of bud, pre-rolled joints, edibles and pot paraphernalia from behind counters that ringed the room. The air smelled lightly of weed \u2014 a sweet alternative to the smell outside, where the wind carried the scent of manure from nearby farmland.\n\nOn weekends, paydays and the April 20 holiday celebrated by pot smokers, this location can serve 800 to 900 customers, said Tucker Eldridge, general manager of production. The sprawling facility includes a medical marijuana dispensary, a warren of indoor grow rooms, two-and-a-half rooftop greenhouses and space for manufacturing edibles and hash oil. It employs about 100 people, Eldridge said.\n\nUnlike some other jurisdictions such as Denver, Garden City doesn\u2019t have a special tax on weed. Its marijuana-related revenue comes from the 3 percent city sales tax, plus state marijuana sales tax money shared with local jurisdictions, Campbell said.\n\nShe estimates that the four dispensaries in town employ about 225 people among them, making marijuana the largest industry in Garden City. Most of the rest of the town\u2019s commerce comes from small stores and restaurants, such as pawn shops, auto body shops, Mexican restaurants and a gas station.\n\nA Town Transformed\n\nGarden City\u2019s embrace of legal weed hasn\u2019t rankled too many residents; Campbell said she can only think of one person who is adamantly opposed, for religious reasons.\n\nMike Schwartz, co-owner of Empire State Pizza, a family-friendly restaurant full of arcade games, said some old-timers might be against the industry. \u201cBut you can\u2019t argue with the results,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to the influx of sales tax revenue, Garden City has been able to spend more on public works such as the new sidewalks and crosswalks along Eighth Avenue, the street outside Empire State Pizza. The city also provides grants of up to $8,000 to help local businesses pay for property investments such as facade improvements.\n\nEmpire State Pizza\u2019s landlord used one such grant to add windows, an awning and new tiling to the exterior of the restaurant and its neighbor, a popular hot wings restaurant called Wing Shack. Schwartz used another grant to replace the pizza place\u2019s outdoor signage, he said.\n\nThe money also has allowed the city to add new services. Garden City used to be patrolled by the county sheriff\u2019s office, but now it can afford its own four-person police force. Campbell\u2019s staff \u2014 once just her \u2014 has swelled to three and a temp, not including the police department.\n\nThe flood of visitors to local dispensaries has been good for the pizza business, Schwartz said. He cross-promotes with the marijuana retailer across the street, including by offering customers there a coupon for free garlic knots. The tagline? \u201cPizza tastes better when baked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hungry people walking out of that building,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nLimits to the Cash Cow\n\nGarden City isn\u2019t the only small Colorado town that\u2019s been transformed by marijuana revenue. Marijuana sales have helped rural Log Lane Village pave streets and replace water lines, according to Town Clerk Bobbie Mesmer. Marijuana sales have revitalized De Beque, a fading oil and gas town in Western Colorado, and boosted artsy Trinidad, near the New Mexico border.\n\nIn larger jurisdictions, however, pot has had less of an impact \u2014 despite headline-grabbing revenue figures.\n\nDenver expects to collect over $48 million this year from taxes on marijuana sales, licensing fees and state tax money shared with the city ($584 million of weed was legally sold in the city last year, raising about $45 million in revenue). But all that pot money comprises less than 4 percent of the city budget.\n\nThe money helps fund city priorities \u2014 such as maintenance projects, affordable housing and combating the opioid epidemic. \u201cIt\u2019s $48 million we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d said Molly Duplechian, deputy director of policy and administration at the city and county Department of Excise and Licenses.\n\nSome $8 million to $9 million of Denver\u2019s marijuana money covers the cost of regulating the industry and running marijuana-related public health campaigns, such as a push to educate young people about the consequences of underage use. Towns need to set aside money to manage the industry, Duplechian said. \u201cI always, always try to emphasize, when I\u2019m talking to other jurisdictions, how important that\u2019s been.\u201d\n\nIn Edgewater, a small city of some 5,000 people that shares a border with Denver, marijuana sales generate about 12 percent of annual tax revenue \u2014 less than one of the local big box stores, said City Manager HJ Stalf.\n\nStalf said the city is wary of relying too much on an industry that\u2019s controversial at the federal level. That\u2019s why the money has been spent on capital improvements, such as a new civic center, new police cars and road upgrades, rather than on staff positions, he said. \u201cIf it were to go away, we wouldn\u2019t have to lay anyone off.\u201d\n\nThe state of Colorado collected $247 million in marijuana-related revenue last year, less than 1 percent of its overall revenue, said Shannon Gray, marijuana communication specialist at the Colorado Department of Revenue. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been nearly the amount of money, when you put it in the context of the entire state budget, as some media reports would have you believe.\u201d\n\nSome members of the public mistakenly think schools are getting a windfall from weed, because $40 million in annual excise tax revenue from marijuana sales goes into a school construction fund, said Chris Stiffler, an economist at the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a Denver-based think tank. The state also has spent additional marijuana money on public schools, including $31.6 million in fiscal 2016-17.\n\nThe marijuana money comprises only around 1 percent of the state\u2019s overall education budget. But the misconception can make it harder for school superintendents to convince voters to raise local education taxes, Stiffler said.\n\nSaying \u2018No\u2019 to Weed\n\nFour years after legal marijuana sales began in Colorado, plenty of communities remain wary of pot shops. Greeley\u2019s City Council voted in 2013 to ban commercial sales, and a 2016 city report concluded that the cost of regulating marijuana could cancel out expected tax revenue while creating public health and safety problems, the Greeley Tribune reported at the time.\n\nCity council members initially voted against pot sales because they were concerned about enforcement and possible conflict with the federal government, said City Manager Roy Otto. The Greeley Tribune\u2019s coverage of Garden City\u2019s marijuana revenue hasn\u2019t moved council members to reconsider the ban, he said.\n\nThere is, however, a chance that a citizens group could put a petition to allow marijuana sales on next year\u2019s ballot, he said. \u201cWill Greeley ultimately legalize it, the way they did alcohol? Time will tell.\u201d\n\nMarijuana\u2019s impact on health and safety in Colorado has been mixed, according to an October report from the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice. Law enforcement officers aren\u2019t filing more cases of serious marijuana-related crimes, but organized crime related to marijuana has been rising.\n\nFewer young people say they\u2019re using marijuana, but more Colorado marijuana users are being hospitalized, though that may be partly because people now feel more comfortable telling doctors they smoke weed, the report cautioned.\n\nIn Garden City, legal sales haven\u2019t led to a noticeable increase in crime, Campbell said. She can think of one break-in \u2014 \u201cthat amounted to nothing\u201d \u2014 and some minor shoplifting. The city doesn\u2019t set aside money especially for marijuana enforcement or policing, she said.\n\nIf anything, local business owners say, the town feels safer now thanks to the new police department.\n\nThe Garden City location of Smokey\u2019s: A 4:20 House, a recreational and medical dispensary, has never had a break-in, but it\u2019s reassuring to know that the police aren\u2019t far away, said Jake Smith, marketing administrator and president of the Garden City Business Association. \u201cNow I can sleep knowing that if someone did try, the Garden City Police Department is a block away from my store.\u201d\n\nThe dispensaries have worked hard to be good citizens. Nature\u2019s Herbs and Wellness sponsors a Thanksgiving food drive and a winter coat drive, for instance, and LivWell Enlightened Health \u2014 a chain of dispensaries with a location in Garden City \u2014 has a philanthropic arm that\u2019s active all over Colorado.\n\nPerhaps the biggest long-term threat the marijuana industry poses to Garden City is competition. If more Weld County towns allow pot sales, Garden City\u2019s stores will lose their lock on the local market and become less lucrative."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "I Microdosed LSD To Ease Depression And Gain Creative Clarity", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microdosing-lsd-for-depression-work-creativity_us_5b4619e3e4b0c523e2651ce7", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "It was a little over a year ago that I first heard about microdosing, which has become popular with Silicon Valley types in recent years. The basic premise of microdosing is, instead of taking the traditional \u201chit\u201d of LSD, you take a fraction of a hit (anywhere from one-fifth to 1/16 of a full dose) once every three days or so, which allows you to reap the supposed creative and social benefits.\n\nI was in need of some creative problem-solving at the time, so I decided to do some more research.\n\nI had been having trouble feeling good about myself, my decisions and my life in general since I\u2019d moved to the isolating Colorado mountains with my husband in the previous year. My creativity and motivation had tanked as well. My troubles seemed to multiply when winter rolled around, so I suspected the depression might be seasonal, but it failed to fully evaporate when the snow melted. I took up running, healthier eating and supplemented with high doses of Vitamin D to attempt a natural mood boost. All that helped to a degree, but I was still feeling stuck at the end of most days.\n\nI read about how microdosing can alleviate symptoms of depression, with effects that can last for months. LSD seems to have a significant effect on the a person\u2019s default mode network (DMN), the part of the brain in charge of a person\u2019s self-reflection, autobiographical memory collection and sense of self.\n\nAccording to a study on patients with clinical depression, the DMN has been shown to be overactive in depressed people, possibly leading to rumination (being \u201cstuck in the past\u201d) and obsessive negative thoughts. Another study on people taking a moderate dose of LSD shows that people generally think less about the past, but equally about the present and future while they\u2019re on the drug. It also suggests that using LSD can calm the DMN, so to speak.\n\nThese studies have small sample sizes, and the LSD study utilizes a full dose for the effects on the DMN, but it was enough evidence for me to think ingesting tiny bits of the stuff might help me.\n\nI\u2019ll preface this by saying LSD and I have a history. [Editor\u2019s Note: The Drug Enforcement Agency classifies LSD as a Schedule I substance, defined as \u201cdrugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d] I\u2019ve taken full doses of the stuff in my rowdy younger days with no ill effects, but at the ripe old age of 32, I rarely find the 12 hours necessary to travel to the outer realms of consciousness and recalibrate my brain \u2014 and to be honest, I rarely have the desire. LSD is a powerful substance and can have radical effects on everything from latent psychiatric disorders to daily thought processes, so it should be treated with respect.\n\nThus, the primary focus of my experiment was proper dosing. As much fun as it sounds, I did not want to accidentally end up in a client meeting while peaking on even half a tab of LSD. To that end, I opted for an even smaller dose than the usual microdosing range: 1/20 of a hit. It\u2019s worth mentioning here that hits of LSD are rarely created equal. According to Erowid, the average potency range for a single hit is 50 to 150 micrograms, and there\u2019s no way to determine the strength of a hit of LSD other than word of mouth.\n\nWithout much more than anecdotal measuring methods to guide me, I got to it. The current literature on microdosing suggests using liquid LSD, but the less-than-ideal blotter form is much more commonly available, and due to the federal status of the drug, one can\u2019t be too picky about what\u2019s available. I got the blotter from someone I trust.\n\nI waited for a day I didn\u2019t have anywhere important to be, in case all my dosing research backfired. My method was one tab of the good stuff, drowned in 20 shots of distilled water in a glass bottle. I shook it up and let it sit in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I ate a decent breakfast, shook it up again (shaking it is important!), poured a shot and drank it, and went about my day.\n\nAs a wedding photographer\u2019s assistant, my average workday at that time involved going through thousands of wedding photos to pick the best ones, so you could say my average workday was pretty dull. Both my husband and I worked from home most of the time, but sometimes we didn\u2019t interact for hours, so I was generally left to myself.\n\nMy first few hours on a microdose felt the same as every day before it. In fact, at some point, I forgot I had taken anything.\n\nThat\u2019s because microdosing doesn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re on drugs. You don\u2019t hallucinate at all, nor do you feel \u201coff.\u201d When I went to the grocery store later that first day, I was able to talk and respond to people just fine. I didn\u2019t start touching random stuff, like I might on a full dose, but I did look at things I pass every day and wonder what they would feel like to the touch. I was just a little more curious about everything around me. I wanted to hear people talk; I wanted to listen.\n\nAt around 2 p.m. on my first dose day, I was sitting at my computer culling wedding photos. About halfway through a stranger\u2019s father-daughter dance, a lump formed in my throat, and I teared up, thinking about my own father-daughter dance years ago. I\u2019d been depressed for a year at that point, and I hadn\u2019t had an emotional outpouring of that caliber in a long time.\n\nAfterward, I found myself totally invested in my task of picking the absolute best photos of this moment between these two people. One of my goals had been to find motivation, but I hadn\u2019t expected it to come so quickly or with such force.\n\nIt was as if, after years of mindlessly doing this task every day, I suddenly understood why my job was important, and it was impossible to put aside. I was honored to be doing it, too\u2014I was choosing the photos that would color these people\u2019s memories for the rest of their lives. What could be more important than that?\n\nSurely there are moments like this in most people\u2019s lives, when things just click, without the influence of LSD. But it\u2019s hard to imagine it happening for me without that extra push, at a time when my emotional landscape had all but dried up.\n\nSo I continued to microdose for a few months, once every three days, avoiding dosing on days when I had meetings scheduled. Once in a while, I would forget to dose, and I didn\u2019t notice anything missing. I was still smiling. I was more patient and took on situations with a new openness. I thought of other people\u2019s perspectives as much as I considered my own. It didn\u2019t feel unnatural or psychedelic\u2014I was aware of what was happening and was actively in control of it.\n\nThe experiment culminated on one chilly day when my jar of liquid had mostly frozen in the fridge. I took a shot of the thawed portion, and I accidentally tripped on what I estimate to be a quarter hit of LSD. (The stuff settles; that\u2019s why shaking the full amount is important when using a blotter.)\n\nEven though that queasy six hours I spent hanging out with my cat watching clouds go by was quite nice, I didn\u2019t really feel like dosing after that. So I didn\u2019t.\n\nThat was a year ago.\n\nA few months ago, I found myself in a similar hole of depression, doldrums or a lengthy blue note. My marriage had encountered some trouble; we were both neglecting each other, and I was starting to feel isolated. I found my focus clogging up at work. Stuck on relationship woes and regrets from my past, every night I\u2019d watch the clock hit 3 a.m. before I finally got to sleep. I decided to see a therapist, and shortly after that, I went for round two of microdosing to see if I could find some clarity.\n\nThis time around I would be focused on my interpersonal relationships, my marriage, my negative thought patterns, and my long-term satisfaction in life. It was becoming clear that those were recurring issues for me, and as long as I avoided looking at them, I would continue to be unhappy. I put off dosing for a week before I found the guts to do it.\n\nOn the first day, I found myself chattier than usual and happy about it. That morning, I sent messages to friends I hadn\u2019t talked to in a long time, and genuinely enjoyed catching up. There wasn\u2019t much to do at work, so I let myself take a break from my to-do list, and realized how hard it has been for me to do that. I went to a coffee shop 30 miles from my house and enjoyed a large iced coffee.\n\nSitting outside on the coffee shop patio, I refrained from burying myself in my laptop or my phone and committed to simply existing. The coffee was good. I overheard conversations between strangers and a chorus of birds in the trees. I felt like I was connected to the world and the people in it. I felt like I belonged there.\n\nOnce again, after months of negative thought loops, enjoying myself was almost overwhelming in a commonplace way, like a mild religious experience.\n\nA month of dosing every third day, combined with daily journaling and weekly therapy sessions, helped me to see where I was getting stuck and illuminated the good things around me. I saw that I was stewing on small things for a disproportionate amount of time when I could be using that time to engage myself or create something I\u2019m proud of. I saw that I wasn\u2019t taking very good care of myself, especially mentally.\n\nMy husband and I had some big issues we needed to work on, and I found the drive to start some uncomfortable conversations. I was isolating myself, and I needed to reach out to friends and family more than I had been. And despite my general dissatisfaction with life, I was able to see that many parts of it had noticeably improved in the last few years, and I had a lot to be proud of.\n\nAnd once again, I started to feel like what I do every day is important and meaningful, which makes all this work worth doing. It\u2019s a lesson worth learning twice.\n\nAfter two rounds of microdosing over two years, I consider it to be a kind of curtain opener. When the curtain is closed, you can\u2019t see anything but your own darkness; but when it\u2019s open, you can see everything else in the room. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a singular way out of the hole of depression\u2014and to think of it that way may be a dangerous path for some\u2014but I do think it helped me find the ladder.\n\nUnlike other drugs people use to self-medicate, LSD in a microdose doesn\u2019t numb your feelings. It\u2019s not a painkiller. The pain is still there but with just enough light shed onto it to lend a context to what\u2019s hurting you.\n\nAnd sometimes, all you need to gain some perspective is a little light."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Elon Musk Ducks Out Of One Los Angeles Tunnel But Pursues Another", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-los-angeles-tunnel_us_5bffb16ae4b0850623199de0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-05 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy.\n\nSome scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems.

Traditional ultrasounds can show the structure and location of the placenta, not how well the organ is functioning. But advances over the past five years have sharpened the machine\u2019s focus. One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems.
