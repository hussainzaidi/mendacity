Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lands in second with 14%. Support for each is about the same as in October. O'Rourke lands in third with 9%, up 5 points since October. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker follows at 5%. California Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have each dropped 5 points since October and are now below 5% support.\n\nNone of the other 14 possible candidates tested hits 5% support.\n\nMore than a year out from any primaries or caucuses and with most candidates undeclared, there are few meaningful demographic or political differences in the nomination race. One that helped define the 2016 battle for the Democratic nod between Hillary Clinton and Sanders continues on, with Sanders garnering much more support among younger voters (22% among those under age 45) than he gets among the older crowd (7% of those age 45 and up back him).\n\nRep. John Delaney of Maryland is the only fully declared candidate in the field of polled candidates, and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro announced earlier this week that he is forming an exploratory committee. Neither earns 1% in the poll. Others have taken public, though not formal, steps toward running, and several have already made visits to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nO'Rourke, the only candidate to make significant gains since CNN last polled on the race in October, said late last month that he hasn't ruled out a run for president, a shift from his flat denials of a run for the White House during his unsuccessful campaign for Senate earlier this year.\n\nAmong all adults, the top tier candidates are generally viewed more positively than negatively. Warren is one exception. She is a frequent target of President Donald Trump, and views of Warren tilt narrowly negative: 32% see her unfavorably, 30% favorably.\n\nAmong the potential Democratic electorate, however, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Booker, O'Rourke and Harris are all seen far more positively than negatively, with O'Rourke and Harris still unknown by a majority.\n\nThe size of the field suggests the race could go deep in to the primary season, a prospect many Democrats would like to avoid. The poll finds 51% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say it would be better for the party if one strong candidate emerged early on as the clear front-runner for the nomination, while 41% said they'd prefer a number of strong candidates to compete for the nod. That's a reversal from 2015, when 53% said they wanted to see a number of strong candidates contend for the lead, but only Hillary Clinton and Sanders ended up finding substantial support.\n\nSelf-identified Democrats split from Democratic-leaning independents on this question. Partisans are more apt to say they want to see one strong candidate emerge early (57% say so), while independents tilt toward a bigger, more competitive field (50% favor that).\n\nWhoever may emerge from the Democratic nomination fight, just over half of all adults (51%) say they think Trump will lose his re-election bid, that's up from 47% who said so in October before the midterm elections saw sharp Republican losses in House races across the country. That figure includes 17% of Republicans who think the President will lose.\n\nLess optimism in US economy\n\nViews of the economy -- the President's strongest issue in terms of approval ratings -- are beginning to soften, according to the poll. If that trend continues it could prove a threat to his re-election chances. While most still say the economy is in good shape, perceptions of the economy as \"very good,\" which had reached their highest level since June 2000 in a September CNN poll, have dropped 9 points, and the share who expect the economy to be in \"very good\" shape a year from now has dipped 10 points. Those declines come almost entirely among Republicans.\n\nTrump has publicly attacked General Motors CEO Mary Barra over the company's decision to shutter plants in the US, and the poll suggests the public may back his criticism. Overall, 64% say that the loss of any manufacturing jobs in the US is a loss for the nation's economy because manufacturing is critical to economic success, while just 26% see the loss of manufacturing jobs as inevitable as the economy changes for the better.\n\nBut his tariff policies may not prove as popular. Most, 68%, say they see foreign trade as an opportunity for economic growth through exports rather than as a threat from imports.\n\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS December 6 through 9 among a random national sample of 1,015 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 463 self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, it is 5.6 points for results among the potential Democratic electorate."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "'Tis the season for 2020 presidential decisions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/W7DCtbjJ5Yg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) They're scouting office space, scooping up staffers and lining up support -- the would-be 2020 Democratic candidates are assembling the structures they'll need to run for president right now, in the final weeks of 2018.\n\nAnd for the ones that are furthest along, all that comes next is the green light to make it official.\n\nTake Elizabeth Warren, for example.\n\nShe may have suffered a bruising news cycle last week, but the Massachusetts senator is full steam ahead on building the infrastructure for a run -- even reportedly shopping for office space for a campaign HQ in Boston . Warren also dipped her toe into supporters' inboxes this weekend, issuing a fundraising call to arms in support of Democrat Dan McCready as allegations of election fraud swirl around his NC-9 race.\n\nAnd Joe Biden's got the same sort of infrastructure at the ready -- should he decide he wants to run. Biden played it coy during an interview in Vermont this weekend, saying he wants to spend time with his family and be engaged for the rest of his life ... whatever that means.\n\nThis sort of timeline -- with serious build-up and everything assembled before an official announcement, makes complete sense.\n\nCandidates who have talked publicly about their timelines to decide on a run have narrowed their possible announcement dates to the next two months. If the skeleton of a campaign is assembled now, just before the holidays, they can kick their campaigns into gear as soon as 2019 begins -- giving them the widest fundraising window possible\n\nCory Booker is the latest proof: Visiting New Hampshire this weekend, the New Jersey senator called the trip \"really helpful to me in understanding what a potential presidential campaign would be about,\" and said it makes him \"more confident in making decisions going forward\" ... He also said he'll decide on a run over the holidays\n\nKamala Harris has the same timeline, too: \"Over the holiday, I will make that decision with my family,\" the California senator recently said\n\nBut don't think Democrats are having all the fun.\n\nFor any Republican eyeing a challenge to President Donald Trump in 2020, Iowa Republicans haven't banned challengers from the first-in-the-nation caucus contest, but they're certainly not rolling out the welcome mat.\n\nRepublican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley is playing it cool, telling the Des Moines Register : \"They are welcome to come, but Chuck Grassley won't be appearing with them.\"\n\nThis is similar to the line drawn by Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann: \"If challengers want to come into Iowa, they're welcome,\" Kaufmann said in November . \"...But if those challengers are criticizing Republicans and the President, I'll push back.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Cohen on Trump: The man doesn't tell the truth", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/4GqEJjZDtwU/cohen-told-the-truth-took-responsibility-sot-newday-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Rebecca Rebarich, who noted that partners have been individually notified about how much they owe.\n\n\"US Central Command reviewed its records and found errors in accounting where we failed to charge the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) adequately for fuel and refueling services. USCENTCOM calculated the correct charges, and Department of Defense is in the process of seeking reimbursement,\" she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nIt was a mistake that was first reported last week by The Atlantic and uncovered during a probe by Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who said Thursday he is encouraged that the Pentagon is now taking steps to recover the funds for US taxpayers.\n\n\"This is good news for US taxpayers and underscores the need for strong oversight of the Department of Defense. The American people should not be forced to bear these costs and I am encouraged DOD is taking steps to get full reimbursement,\" Reed said in a statement.\n\nBut while Reed commended the Pentagon for correcting its accounting mistake, he also made clear that the larger issue remains the ongoing conflict in Yemen between the coalition and Houthi rebels that has \"resulted in the largest humanitarian disaster facing the world in recent memory.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration and international community must capitalize on the progress that has been made during the Yemen peace talks in Sweden,\" Reed said in a statement. \"It must be made clear to both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis that there is no military solution to this conflict and the time has come to reach a sustainable negotiated settlement.\"\n\n\"It is time for this war to stop,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commended the progress made during the Yemen talks in Sweden, calling the announcement of a ceasefire in the besieged rebel port city of Hodeidah, a \"pivotal first step.\"\n\n\"All parties have an opportunity to build upon this momentum and improve the lives of all Yemenis. Moving forward, all must continue to engage, de-escalate tensions, and cease ongoing hostilities. This is the best way to give these and future consultations a chance to succeed,\" he said.\n\nBut as talks continue, the Senate made clear on Thursday that it wants to end US involvement in the conflict.\n\nLawmakers overwhelmingly approved a resolution by a 56-41 vote that would require the US to end its military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a move aimed both at ending that war and expressing anger at the Trump administration's handling of relations with Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the US no longer refuels coalition aircraft, the US military does provide the Saudi-led coalition with intelligence focused on helping to defend against Houthi cross border missile and drone attacks. US personnel in Saudi Arabia also advise the coalition on processes and procedures and the law of armed conflict, efforts the Pentagon says are aimed at helping to prevent civilian casualties.\n\nThe vote on the Yemen resolution reflected the frustration senators from parties both have with the vast human suffering from the war and President Donald Trump's embrace of the crown prince despite widely accepted evidence from US intelligence agencies that he ordered the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, utilized the War Powers Act to attempt to force an end to US involvement in the war, even as GOP leaders argued it wasn't necessary because the US was not directly involved in combat and had stopped refueling war planes from Saudi Arabia and other counties in its coalition.\n\nDespite the broad support in the Senate, the GOP-led House is not expected to take a vote on it, meaning the legislation will die at the end of the year when the current congressional session ends."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Strasbourg shooting suspect killed by police, Paris authorities say", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/d1q9Oy4vhdk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The man suspected of killing at least three people and wounding 13 others at Strasbourg's famed Christmas market has been killed by French police, following a shoot-out not far from the scene of Tuesday's attack.\n\nCherif Chekatt, 29, was shot dead on Thursday evening, two days after he first disappeared sparking a massive manhunt involving hundreds of police officers, soldiers and anti-terror specialists from three European countries.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said police recognized a man who looked like Chekatt walking on the street in Strasbourg's Neudorf district on Thursday night and approached him. He opened fire on officers when they tried to question him, he said.\n\nPolice returned fire, killing the suspect, Castaner said.\n\n\"As I am speaking to you, I am thinking about the victims and the wounded. I am thinking of those close to them. I am thinking of Strasbourg and France that was hit by this terrible attack,\" Castaner said.\n\nOn Thursday, Strasbourg police said the death toll from the attack had risen to three, after one person succumbed to their injuries. Five people remain in serious condition with eight others suffering light injures.\n\nThe hunt prompted a curfew in the eastern French city near the German border and forced the country to raise its national security threat level to its highest status: \"emergency terror attack.\"\n\nFrench prosecutors said the suspect shouted the Arabic phrase \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is greatest,\" at the time of the attack.\n\n\"It's relief for the people of Strasbourg to know that the attacker has been killed,\" Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries said, adding that the Christmas market would reopen on Friday.\n\nThe French National Police thanked the public for their assistance in finding Chekatt.\n\n\"Thank you for your alerts which allowed us to find the wanted individual,\" the National Police said on Twitter.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Paris prosecutor's office said that a fifth person was taken into custody in relation to the attack. \"At this stage there are five people in custody,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAuthorities said Chekatt entered the perimeter of the market, one of the oldest in Europe, by the city's Corbeau Bridge and started shooting and stabbing passers-by on the Rue des Orfevres around 8 p.m., when many were in the middle of their Christmas shopping.\n\nAnti-terror police flooded the market and tried to arrest the suspected gunman. He exchanged fire with security forces, suffering an injury to his arm. The suspected gunman then jumped into a taxi and fled the scene, Heitz said.\n\nOn Thursday, French police evacuated buildings and cordoned off the area close to where Chekatt had fled. The gunman's father, mother and two brothers were also questioned by police, a source close to the investigation told CNN.\n\nCheckatt was already known to security services as a possible threat, police said. He has an extensive criminal background that includes 27 convictions in France, Germany and Switzerland, mostly for acts of robbery and violence.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Police, Cathy Maret, told CNN that Chekatt was well known to authorities there, having been arrested and convicted several times in Switzerland for crimes such as break-ins, theft and violence. He was not on their radar as a radical Islamist or for narcotics violations, she said.\n\nIn 2017, he was deported from Germany to France after the Interior Ministry in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg confirmed he had been convicted of break-ins and serious theft in 2016 and spent time in a German prison. The German Federal Criminal Office said the suspect was not known in Germany as a radical Islamist.\n\nMembers of the French police special forces take part in an operation at the Neudorf neighborhood in Strasbourg.\n\nHowever, Chekatt was known to French prison officials for being radicalized and for his proselytizing behavior in detention in 2015, Paris prosecutor Heitz said, adding that he had been incarcerated multiple times.\n\nHe was also on a French watch list called a \"Fiche S\" surveillance file. The \"Fiche S\" is a French terror and radicalization watch list that includes thousands of people, some of whom are under active surveillance, meaning they are on law enforcement's radar.\n\nHours before the attack, French gendarmes tried to bring Chekatt in for questioning but found he wasn't home, a spokesperson for France's National Police told CNN earlier this week, without providing further details.\n\nChekatt was born in Strasbourg, according to CNN affiliate BFM."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "EU tells May Brexit deal not up for renegotiation as wounded UK leader seeks lifeline", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jQHN1ujQqFY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Brussels (CNN) The European Union will not throw British Prime Minister Theresa May a lifeline over Brexit, after she survived a bruising confidence motion triggered by members of her own party.\n\nLeaving Westminster convulsed by the crisis over her leadership, May came to Brussels to plead with EU leaders Thursday at a summit to make the agreement more palatable to skeptical lawmakers in London.\n\nAs she arrived, May said she was there to speak with EU leaders about what it will take to \"get this deal over the line.\"\n\nBut following the meeting, representatives of the bloc said they were sticking with the withdrawal agreement previously agreed with London, including the Northern Ireland backstop deal which threatens to derail it in the UK Parliament. May pulled a vote on the deal this week when it became clear she would suffer a heavy defeat.\n\n\"If we go into negotiations on the future relationship, we need to have a well-constructed proposal and a cogent idea from our British partners and friends, and then we'll look at that,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters.\n\nMay had been seeking legally enforceable guarantees surrounding the Irish backstop -- the insurance policy designed to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop has emerged as the crucial sticking point for many in May's Conservative Party, furious that Britain could only leave it with the approval of the EU.\n\nHardline Brexiters have argued that the risk of a \"no deal\" exit -- which would be devastating for the UK economy and British infrastructure, but would also damage the EU -- would compel Brussels to compromise, but EU leaders don't appear ready to blink.\n\n\"In terms of a no deal, let's not forget ultimately, it is within the gift of the UK government and the UK parliament to take the threat of no deal off the table,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Thursday.\n\n\"It is possible if the UK wishes to, to revoke Article 50, or, if that's a step too far to seek an extension of Article 50,\" he added, referring to the piece of EU law by which the UK triggered Brexit.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the EU leaders' summit in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nMay to 27: 'We must get this right'\n\n\"We must get this right,\" May told the EU27 on Thursday. \"Let's hold nothing in reserve. Let's work together intensively to get this deal over the line in best interest of all our people.\"\n\nShe said a route can be found for the Brexit deal to be approved by the House of Commons.\n\n\"We have to change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK could not escape,\" she said. \"Until we do, the deal, our deal, is at risk... the best result for all of us is to get this deal delivered in an orderly way and get it done now.\"\n\nMay called on leaders to trust her track record.\n\n\"Over the last two years, I hope I have shown you can trust me to do what is right, not always what is easy, however difficult that might be for me politically. ... With the right assurances this deal can be passed. Indeed it is the only deal that is capable of getting through my parliament.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed to CNN that British MPs will not have to vote on May's Brexit deal before the end of the year. However, Downing Street has assured that it will take place before January 21, 2019.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with May, Irish PM Varadkar told reporters that the \"deal that we have is the only deal on the table\" and made clear that he considered it the United Kingdom's responsibility to resolve the crisis.\n\n\"I think there is one thing that's undeniable. All these difficulties that Europe now faces, not least Ireland, but all Europe, we now face these difficulties because of a decision the UK made to leave the European Union,\" he said. \"We respect the decision they've made, but it does mean there is an obligation now on them to come up with the solutions.\"\n\nWhile May won Wednesday's confidence vote, by 200 votes to 117, the margin of victory was significantly narrower than her supporters expected and she arrived in Brussels with her authority further dented.\n\nAn EU diplomat told CNN that the other 27 EU nations were looking to May to \"convince\" them she can get the withdrawal agreement through the UK Parliament.\n\n\"We've seen what happened yesterday. Convince us that what you ask will make a difference. If she pulls that off then we can talk... in the end they are politicians and they will want to help her. We are ready to be convinced,\" the diplomat said.\n\nThe 27 are \"expecting serious clarification of what she plans to do,\" the source said, but for now, May appears to be \"playing for time\" in the hopes that uncertainty will win over the lawmakers she needs to back her deal.\n\nThe diplomat added that they are very concerned about an accidental hard Brexit, saying the \"most likely scenario is stumbling into a no deal.\"\n\nWhy is the Irish border backstop such a big issue? One of the big fears in the Brexit debate is that Britain's departure from the EU will mean the reintroduction of border posts on the frontier between Northern Ireland, which remains part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. Border infrastructure was often targeted by Irish nationalist paramilitaries during the \"Troubles\" -- the 40-year sectarian conflict in which more than 3,500 people died. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal avoids the reintroduction of a so-called \"hard\" border, because of the built-in transition period that keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU. The problems come if there's no agreement on what to do after the transition period ends in 2020. Enter the Irish \"backstop,\" an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border if no other solutions are found by that time. This has infuriated hard-line Brexiteers, worried the UK will never \"properly\" leave the bloc. They want to be free of the customs union, in order to forge international trade deals that would require the UK to be free of EU regulations on issues like agriculture, fisheries, food standards and the environment. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs prop up May's minority government in London, also demands a clean break with the EU, and oppose any move to give Northern Ireland different status from mainland Britain. The big sticking point is that the Brexit deal, as it stands, states that neither side can leave the backstop unilaterally. Brexiteers hate the idea that the EU would hold a power of veto over the UK. But others, including the Irish government, argue that the backstop would be meaningless if Britain could tear it up at will.\n\nEuropeans are holding firm\n\nArriving in Brussels, EU leaders suggested they could offer greater clarity around the deal -- but there was little sign they would make changes substantial enough to win over May's critics at home.\n\n\"The thing now tonight is we have to seek clarifications, particularly on the backstop,\" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \"There is this whole thinking in the UK that this backstop is inevitable, that it will be triggered. I can assure you one thing, there is nobody in their right mind in the European Union who wants to trigger the backstop because this is bad news not only for the UK but also for the EU.\"\n\nRutte added that it would be \"impossible to break open\" the withdrawal agreement, saying: \"This is the only deal possible on the table.\"\n\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz echoed that message. \"The deal we already have is a good one. I think there is also an understanding from Theresa May that there will be no new negotiation of the withdrawal agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"But, of course ... I think there will be some readiness from our side to maybe find some better explanation about the future relationship ... There is also some room to have a better interpretation of what we agreed on.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also rejected any renegotiation of the deal. \"There can be a political discussion, but not a legal one,\" he said. \"It is up to Theresa May to say what the political solution is to get a majority on this agreement.\"\n\nHowever, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, former president of the European Commission, took to Twitter to urge the European Council to show some flexibility over the backstop issue, saying that there would be no more important future relationship for either the UK or EU than with each other.\n\nI know it's possible some flexibility of the #EU to get a deal acceptable by the #uk . If there's political will the excellent lawyers of the #EU can find a creative solution for the #backstop issue.

Importantly, the strategy remains true to his central campaign promise to put the interests of the American people first, both at home and abroad,\" Bolton told the audience at the Heritage Foundation on Thursday.\n\n\"Under our new approach, every decision we make, every policy we pursue, and every dollar of aid we spend will further US priorities in the region,\" he said.\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration's approach appears to lean heavily on the promise that the US will be able to advance trade and commercial ties with nations across the region by exposing the \"predatory practices pursued by Russia and China.\"\n\n\"Great power competitors, namely China and Russia, are rapidly expanding their financial and political influence across Africa. They are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the United States,\" Bolton said.\n\nBy focusing economic efforts \"on African governments that act with us as strategic partners, and, which are striving toward improved governance and transparent business practices,\" Bolton said the US will help prepare those nations address security threats, including terrorism and militant violence.\"\n\n\"Our goal is for the nations of the region to take ownership over peace and security in their own neighborhood,\" he added.\n\nCNN reported last month that the Pentagon has already approved a long-awaited plan to reduce the number of US troops conducting counterterrorism missions in Africa over the next three years, despite senior US military commanders warning last year that the terror threat in many African nations was growing, particularly in West Africa.\n\nThe planned reductions are part of a broader global effort intended to help better align the US military's global posture with the Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy, which focuses more on \"near-peer\" competitors like Russia and China as opposed to counterterrorism missions.\n\nA senior defense official said that the US would be \"changing, and yes, reducing some of our efforts\" and said \"by recouping some of this investment, it allows us to train, experiment and plan for the near peer competitors.\"\n\nThe administration's economic push in Africa is also intended to challenge inroads that have allowed China and Russian to exert a growing amount of influence on the continent.\n\nChina has a strong foothold in Africa, though, with massive infrastructure spending and development. While it will be difficult for the US to confront Beijing's influence in the region, distrust of China's lending policies is growing and Bolton said the administration intends to capitalize on that discontent.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported that \"episodes involving discriminatory behavior by the region's growing Chinese work force have unsettled many Kenyans, particularly at a time when their government seeks closer ties with China.\"\n\nFor it's part, Russia \"is also seeking to increase its influence in the region through corrupt economic dealings,\" according to Bolton, who said Moscow \"advances its political and economic relationships with little regard for the rule of law or accountable and transparent governance.\"\n\n\"In short, the predatory practices pursued by China and Russia stunt economic growth in Africa; threaten the financial independence of African nations; inhibit opportunities for US investment; interfere with US military operations; and pose a significant threat to US national security interests,\" Bolton said.\n\nOne problem is that the US is not clearly seen as the better option for African nations with Trump at the helm.\n\nThe Trump administration has cut aid to Africa for vital health programs that have real impact on lives and no one forgets the January Oval Office meeting where the President decried immigrants from the continent as coming from \"shithole\" countries , comments that prompted a rare public a rebuke from several African leaders.\n\nTrump also waited more than a year to meet an African leader, though Bolton alluded to a potential upcoming presidential trip to the continent.\n\nStill, Bolton claimed that the Trump administration is prioritizing Africa in a way previous administration's failed to do, emphasizing the long-term goal of helping nations in the region become self-sufficient.\n\nBut at the same time, the Trump administration has already cut several programs intended to foster long-term development from the ground up, a move that has raised questions about the US commitment to working with nations in the region in a mutually beneficial way.\n\nOne such program is the State Department's Young African Leaders Initiative, a group of young people who have been chosen from pool of applicants in the tens of thousands, to come study in the US because they are actively making their communities better in some way at home.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, YALI programs have been cut by one-third, meaning hundreds fewer students from throughout sub-Saharan Africa are able to come to the US, according to Neil Piper, executive director of The Presidential Precinct, which hosts the Mandela Washington Fellowship.\n\n\"This program is reaching people throughout Africa, in places where no one else is going. There is a lot of bipartisan support for it,\" he told CNN. \"Now this is 250 fewer young leaders per year -- who are actually making positive changes in their home communities -- who won't have this kind of support and exposure to the United States. It's a big missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"In Africa, it's clear that China is making investments on the ground. Looking for opportunities to make real connections will be key. Otherwise, we're going to be left behind by other countries willing to do this,\" he added.\n\nBut Bolton argued that the US has spent billions of taxpayer dollars on aid to Africa and little has changed.\n\n\"They have not stopped the scourge of terrorism, radicalism, and violence. They have not prevented other powers, such as China and Russia, from taking advantage of African states to increase their own power and influence,\" he said.\n\n\"Our new foreign assistance strategy would ensure that all US foreign aid, in every corner of the globe, advances US interests,\" Bolton added. \"From now on, the United States will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without accountability, and relief without reform.\"\n\nBolton's approach was also criticized by humanitarian groups.\n\n\"While we commend the recognition of African countries as important trade and security partners, the strategy falls short in providing a coherent approach to preventing violent conflict and terrorism across the continent,\" Richmond Blake, Director of Policy and Advocacy for Mercy Corps said.\n\nBlake also observed that \"a commitment to advancing human rights and democracy\" was absent from the strategy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "High-speed train crashes into bridge, killing seven, in Turkey", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/vjKz1rQzYeE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A high-speed train crashed Thursday in the Turkish capital of Ankara, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more, according to the city's governor.\n\nAt a press conference at the site of the crash, the governor, Vasip Sahin, said 46 people had been hurt in the crash, which took place at around 6.30 a.m. local time.\n\n\"Our hope is the number of dead does not increase, but our units are working,\" Sahin said. \"Once their work is complete, we will be able to share more information.\"\n\nThe train collided head-on with a maintenance vehicle in Ankara's Marsandiz station, causing part of a bridge to collapse onto two carriages, state news agency Anadolu said.\n\nRescue workers search through wreckage after a high-speed train crash Thursday in Ankara, Turkey.\n\nTwo of those injured were in a critical condition, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told the agency, adding no more wounded were at the crash site as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Bomb threats emailed to multiple locations across the country", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/tbKXCdJ9Kr8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Dozens of businesses and institutions across the United States and Canada received email threats Thursday afternoon, prompting evacuations and sweeps of buildings.\n\nGuy Dickinson tweeted this photo of police at 17th Street and K Street Northwest in Washington, DC on Thursday afternoon.\n\nAt this time it's unclear if the threats -- which have been received in San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Miami, Washington, DC and other locations nationwide -- are connected.

The chief said the department's review will focus on the 108 rape kits that CNN identified as being destroyed since 2010 before a statute of limitation expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. Seventy-five percent of those kits, tied to cases reported as recently as 2014, were never submitted to a lab to be tested for DNA, CNN found.\n\nSpringfield Police stood out from other agencies for the variety and volume of investigative shortcomings that led to kit destruction and how quickly rape kits were destroyed. Dozens of untested kits were destroyed in a year or less after victims reported being assaulted, according to department records.\n\nExperts who reviewed Springfield case files at CNN's request called practices they saw in its investigations \"disturbing.\" The police imposed 10-day deadlines on victims shortly after they reported being assaulted. If victims did not respond in time, their cases were closed and their kits destroyed while prosecutions were still viable. The police also gave victims waivers declining their option to prosecute before thorough investigations had been conducted, a tactic that effectively ended cases.\n\nOutraged by revelations in CNN's investigation, the grassroots organization asked for the meeting with Williams so he could respond to their questions and requests. Police declined to open the discussion to journalists.\n\nIn their meeting, Me Too members said they asked the chief to notify every victim whose kit was trashed and reopen those cases if possible.\n\nWilliams rejected that idea, according to Sarah Bargo, Me Too's secretary, because the chief said he feared that contacting victims risked re-traumatizing them.\n\nWilliams told Me Too that he is working with The Victim Center , Springfield's primary rape advocacy group, to use the center's hotline -- 417-864-SAFE -- as a way for victims to ask questions about their cases or rape kits.\n\nVictim Center director Brandi Bartel told CNN that the plan is in its early stages. Victims who call the line could give the center permission to pass their questions to police. Bartel expects that the police department would then contact the victim directly.\n\n\"I want to be helpful,\" she said. \"But I want to be clear -- we are not law enforcement. We are not attorneys.\"\n\nSince CNN's story published, one victim whose case is currently being investigated has contacted the department to learn the status of the rape kit, according to written answers police gave to Me Too and provided to CNN. Two other victims have told police they feel their cases were mishandled.\n\nThe department declined to discuss those cases, citing the victims' privacy.\n\nSpringfield Police Chief Paul Williams told an advocacy organization his department would review rape kit destruction.\n\nMe Too members asked Williams if he would consider bringing in outside experts to review the department's current sex crimes investigations. Such reviews are considered best practice in policing.\n\nWilliams told the group that he's reaching out to an organization that may be able to \"spot check\" Springfield's sex crimes cases, Me Too vice president Kelsey Nichol told CNN.\n\nWilliams said the agency has stopped imposing 10-day deadlines on sex crime victims or giving them prosecution declination waivers.\n\nMe Too also asked Williams about the department's backlog of untested kits. Williams had previously told the group that he ordered a review of all kits in 2014 and found that the agency had more than 300 on hand. Williams told Me Too that police had reduced the number of untested kits to 237 and expected to finish testing the rest within two years.\n\nMe Too members told CNN they wanted more information about the state's intention to establish a system to track rape kits as they make their way from police to a lab for testing. Williams told them that discussions about that will begin after the first of the year.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Missouri Attorney General's Office said that Attorney General Josh Hawley \"hopes grant funding will allow Missouri to test existing kits and establish statewide protocols that will prevent any kit from going untested in the future.\"\n\nMembers left the meeting feeling good, they said.\n\n\"I went into the meeting feeling apprehensive,\" Nichol said. \"But it went very well. We felt heard by the department.\"\n\nElsewhere, a police chief in Lapeer, Michigan, who apologized for his department's destruction of rape kits , told CNN on Thursday that he's taken several steps since the story appeared to improve his agency's handling of cases. David Frisch said he's created a policy specific to sexual assault investigation, updated the department's evidence policy and gotten members of the department training on sexual assault.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney general in Washington state said he would notify every law enforcement agency in his state and direct them to ensure that rape kits are not being inappropriately destroyed.\n\nIn New York, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the destruction of kits by a police department in his state \"disturbing.\" The governor has directed state police to contact the agency and ensure it is \"complying with state law regarding the handling of rape kits,\" spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement.\n\nIn Georgia, state Rep. Scott Holcomb told CNN that its investigation prompted him to begin writing legislation to introduce next session that would outlaw destruction of rape kits before the statute of limitations expires.\n\nAnd, national nonprofit organization the Joyful Heart foundation took action. Its program End the Backlog is credited with persuading state lawmakers across the nation to enact laws requiring the testing of rape kits. Days after CNN's investigation, it updated its model legislation to include a provision stating, \"Kits associated with a reported crime that is uncharged or unsolved should be preserved for 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations, whichever is greater.\"\n\nCNN's investigation \"shined a bright light on a largely unknown\" problem, said Ilse Knecht, the Joyful Heart foundation's director of policy and advocacy.\n\n\"You can't say all kits should be tested if kits are destroyed.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "North Carolina's election fraud scandal has both parties planning for another campaign", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/P1Snqu2eP5o/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) Republican and Democratic officials in North Carolina are beginning to maneuver for position in anticipation of a fierce and protracted second campaign in the state's scandal-ridden 9th Congressional District.\n\nLeaders from both parties have all but publicly agreed that a new election is necessary, but they are pursuing much different paths to winning it.\n\nDemocrats are zeroing in on Republican nominee Mark Harris' ties to operative at the center of the alleged election fraud, demanding Harris personally address the depth of their relationship, while escalating nationwide fundraising appeals to back their candidate, Dan McCready. Republicans have sought to nudge Harris from the stage, most clearly by moving to mandate a new primary in the case a new general election is called, and by suggesting -- as one senior party official did to CNN -- that the mess has rendered him damaged political goods.\n\nOn Thursday night, The Washington Post added to those doubts with a report that Harris decided to hire Dowless earlier in the campaign than had been previously known -- and in defiance of warnings about his criminal background and rumors of shady tactics.\n\nThe decision to re-run the midterm race, which Harris initially appeared to have won by a slim margin in November, ultimately rests with the State Board of Elections, which is overseeing an investigation into allegations of an absentee ballot fraud operation directed by an operative on the payroll of a firm hired by Harris.\n\nIn North Carolina and around the country, Democrats are rallying around McCready ahead of the board's as-yet-unscheduled evidentiary hearing, sending out calls for campaign cash and, at a press conference in Raleigh earlier this week, hammering Harris over his refusal to explain the extent of his relationship with the operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Tammy Baldwin have also asked supporters to donate to McCready.\n\nHarris has not spoken publicly since last Friday, when he denied in a taped statement having any prior knowledge of misconduct committed on his behalf. Dowless previously denied any wrongdoing to the Charlotte Observer and has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWith the affidavits piling up and elections board probe potentially widening, Republicans fearful that the scandal has made Harris effectively unelectable and vulnerable to still more unsavory revelations, are both in the media and through their legislative actions moving to nudge him off the field.\n\nOn Wednesday, the North Carolina state legislature, which is controlled by a lame duck Republican supermajority, passed a bill with Democratic support that would require any call for a new general election to also include a second primary. For the GOP, that means a chance for Republicans like Rep. Robert Pittenger or, according to some rumors, former Gov. Pat McCrory, to challenge Harris and potentially prevent him from being re-nominated.\n\nIt is unclear whether Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will sign the Republican bill.\n\n\"North Carolinians deserve honest and fair elections and the Governor is reviewing this legislation carefully,\" said Ford Porter, a spokesperson for Cooper.\n\nRepublican leaders have stopped short of calling on Harris to seek a legal avenue for exiting the race entirely, but one senior state GOP official told CNN the Charlotte-based pastor's odds are getting longer.\n\n\"There is a growing realization of whatever the final facts are and irrespective of their personal affection for Mr. Harris -- he is facing an insurmountable political problem that could have a major impact on the party,\" the official said, before questioning Harris' long spell of public silence: \"One taped statement and no interviews in 14 days? That is a death wish in a political situation like this.\"\n\nHarris has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nRepublicans might be souring on Harris, but they aren't about to cede the 9th District seat. Two GOP state lawmakers on Thursday acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of fraud, but argued that the problem affected voters of all stripes -- and should not be viewed in through a partisan lens. (There are no credible allegations of fraud or misconduct against the Democrat McCready's campaign.)\n\nIn response to a fundraising email sent out Thursday afternoon by the North Carolina Democratic Party, which is seeking to frame the ongoing scandal as a swindle perpetrated by state Republicans known for \"passing monstrous voter suppression laws to rigging our maps,\" GOP state Sen. Dan Bishop lashed out and accused Democrats of seeking to make political hay out of a \"very serious issue.\"\n\n\"The gall, I mean it really does take brass ones, to go out and run fundraising drives alleging that this is a Republican thing,\" Bishop told CNN, \"and of course exploiting as an opportunist the situation that is emerging driven by a media frenzy.\"\n\nAsked if he had confidence in the state elections board, Bishop suggested it could be compromised by the ascent of a Democrat to its top position, saying the investigation \"ought to be a fair process and those who are in positions like the Board of Elections must set aside their partisanship and proceed in a way that's fair.\"\n\nState Sen. Mike Woodard, a Democrat who supported the bill that would attach the new primary to a new general election, said the party was prepared to rally behind McCready should the board follow through as he expected and ultimately call for a second vote.\n\n\"In backing Dan (McCready) and on insisting that all the votes count and that we have a thoroughly legal, aboveboard process that helps restore our confidence in voting, the party has taken the right steps to get here,\" Woodard said. \"If we're moving toward a March primary, and an election sometime in the spring, I'm confident our party will do that.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Slain teen 'might be alive' if authorities hadn't overlooked evidence, prosecutor says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/9hsUAscGoR8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The kidnapping and killing of 13-year-old Hania Aguilar may have been prevented if authorities had properly handled DNA evidence from a separate case last year, a North Carolina prosecutor said.\n\nRobeson County District Attorney Luther Johnson Britt told reporters on Wednesday that authorities had evidence linking suspect Michael Ray McLellan to a rape case for at least a year but they took no action.\n\n\"This hurts,\" Britt said. \"This is like taking a punch to the gut and not being prepared to get it.\"\n\nThe county's sheriff and district attorney offices were notified in October 2017 that DNA recovered from a 2016 rape kit possibly matched McLellan.

The committee was registered as a nonprofit.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday night that federal prosecutors are looking into whether people from foreign countries funneled potentially illegal donations to both the inaugural fund and a pro-Trump super PAC in efforts to buy \"influence over American policy.\" The paper, citing people familiar with the inquiry, said it focuses on people from Middle Eastern countries -- including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- and whether they \"used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds.\"\n\nFederal law does not allow foreign contributions to inaugural funds or PACs, according to the Times.\n\nIn a statement, Trump's inaugural committee said the celebration was \"in full compliance with all applicable laws.\"\n\n\"The (committee) is not aware of any pending investigations and has not been contacted by any prosecutors. We simply have no evidence the investigation exists,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The (committee's) finances were fully audited internally and independently and are fully accounted. Moreover, the inauguration's accounting was provided both to the Federal Election Commission and the IRS in compliance with all laws and regulations. These were funds raised from private individuals and were then spent in accordance with the law and the expectations of the donors. The names of donors were provided to the FEC and have been public for nearly two years and those donors were vetted in accordance with the law and no improprieties have been found regardng the vetting of those donors.\"\n\nWhen asked by reporters about the Wall Street Journal story Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"That doesn't have anything to do with the President or the first lady. The biggest thing the President did, his engagement in the inauguration, was to come here and raise his hand and take the oath of office. The President was focused on the transition at that time and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.\"\n\nAccording to the Journal, sources told the paper that the investigation \"partly arises out of materials seized in the federal probe of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's business dealings.\"\n\nDuring a raid of Cohen's properties last spring, a recorded conversation between him and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump, was seized, according to the newspaper. Wolkoff expressed concern in the conversation about how the inaugural committee was spending money, a person familiar with the Cohen investigation told the Journal.\n\nRick Gates, Trump's former campaign aide who has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, was asked by prosecutors about the committee's spending and its donors, the Journal reported, citing conversations with people close to the matter.\n\nTom Barrack, a real estate developer who ran the inaugural committee, has not yet spoken with investigators since an interview he had with the special counsel last year, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. During his conversation with Mueller, the inaugural fund was only raised briefly, the source said.\n\n\"The inaugural committee hasn't been asked for records or been contacted by prosecutors. We are not aware of any investigation,\" the source told CNN.\n\nThe committee, which CNN previously reported had raised a record-setting $107 million, received much of its funding from wealthy donors who gave $1 million or more, according to the Journal.

And the crimes for which Michael Cohen is going to jail aren't crimes after all; they were added to his rap sheet by prosecutors as a dig at Trump\n\nBut alternative facts, to borrow the phrase coined by White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to reject facts they reject without evidence, only go so far. Trump learned their limits Thursday afternoon when Republican senators lobbed at him a resolution condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nTrump had ignored the clear conclusion of the CIA that bin Salman was involved in the killing when he issued an exclamation point-laden official statementlast month that it was unproven that Saudi Arabia and its crown prince were complicit. It wouldn't matter anyway , the President said, since Saudi Arabia is buying US military equipment.\n\nNow senators have slapped him on the wrist with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker's resolution, passed by voice vote. They more narrowly voted to restricted US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, he still has to deal with Congress over the federal budget.\n\nAnd CNN reported late Thursday that Trump had been in the room when hush payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with him were discussed by Cohen and David Pecker, whose company publishes the National Enquirer.\n\nA new way for Mexico to pay for the wall\n\nTrump won't have much time to seethe at his allies in the Senate if he wants to keep the government up and running through the holidays.\n\nAfter a televised chess match in which he had declared he'd be proud to shut down the government if Congress wouldn't give him funding for his border wall and border security left him in check, the President opened the door to a change of course Thursday when he argued Mexico was already paying for the wall through the trade agreement he's pushing to replace NAFTA.\n\n\"I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall,' \" Trump said on Twitter. \"This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\"\n\nBut the reality is far different.\n\nThe trade deal hasn't been ratified by Congress yet.

MUST WATCH Schumer: Temper tantrum won't get Trump a wall 00:53\n\nIs the US going to be able to use the NAFTA replacement -- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- to pay for the wall?\n\n\"We're not,\" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. He ticked through possible revenue from a trade deal -- either directly through higher tariffs or indirectly via tax revenue from increased economic activity. There's nothing to suggest the USMCA will land the government a windfall on either count.\n\nEven if Mexico did start pumping money into the USMCA after it passes, Levy said, that doesn't mean it would go to the wall.\n\n\"There's nothing that earmarks this type of money for a wall,\" he said. \"Your income taxes or corporate taxes -- they go into general revenue. But it's still the budget process that determines where those funds go.\"\n\nAnd it's that budget process that has Trump stymied.\n\nSomeone in Washington will have to blink over the $5 billion the President has demanded and Republicans who control the House for less than a month can't deliver.\n\nDemocrats, measuring the drapes in House leadership offices they'll soon occupy, aren't in a giving mood since Trump wants the money to declare victory on a border wall they have vowed to fight.\n\nThe President drew the line in the middle of the Oval Office earlier this week when he all but dared soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer into shutdown mode by pointing out they had been blamed for a brief shutdown in January.\n\nThat's mostly true, but they had forced the shutdown over how to protect the children of undocumented immigrants raised in the US who Trump had stripped of a temporary protected status. Now, those people have been abandoned during the spending negotiations.\n\nInstead, the issue is the $5 billion Trump wants to beef up border security and start building his long-promised wall on the Mexico border. His tweet that Mexico would pay through the USMCA wasn't an entirely new argument, but -- timed immediately after he promised a shutdown -- it felt like the beginning of an out before parts of the government run out of money December 21 -- the same day Trump could get out of the White House and travel down to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas.\n\nThe public largely takes the Democratic side on the wall, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, in which 57% of Americans said they're against a wall , compared with 38% in favor. Those numbers are similar to where they were just after Trump took office in 2017. Most who favor the wall say they would continue to do so even if all the funding for it came from the US rather than from Mexico, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN's polling director.\n\nCrimes that aren't crimes\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Never told Cohen to do anything wrong Replay More Videos ...

CNN reported later Thursday that Trump had been in the room when Cohen and Pecker discussed the hush payment.\n\nTrump has denied having an affair with McDougal.\n\nCohen, his onetime fixer and lieutenant, is now -- in Trump's telling to Fox News -- a lawyer who \"did very low-level work.\" According to Cohen's guilty pleas, that work included orchestrating the payoff. Separately, Cohen was working to get a Trump Tower built in Moscow and trading on Trump's cachet as a political figure to do it.\n\n\"I never instructed him to do anything wrong,\" Trump said in the Fox interview. \"Whatever he did he did on his own. He's a lawyer.\"\n\nAgain, reality differs. Trump says the payments are not crimes, but Cohen is headed to prison. The President says Cohen was a low-level employee who once did him a favor. In truth, Cohen was a top lieutenant who spoke on behalf of his former boss and sought out business deals.\n\nAnother former aide who flipped on Trump, onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn, got better treatment from the President in the interview, in part, perhaps, because he thinks Flynn is stronger than Cohen but also because he doesn't know what Flynn told the special counsel's office.\n\n\"I don't even know what he said about me,\" Trump said of Flynn. \"Maybe they scared him enough he'll make up a story.\"\n\nIf Flynn says the President did anything wrong, Trump will surely have his own story to explain it away."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Rape survivors are fighting back against victim-blaming in Lebanon", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ameEaCTRyaQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) \"I've been raped,\" Manal Issa shouts as she staggers down a street in Beirut.\n\nA crowd gathers around the woman who appears disoriented and frantic.

One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file.

When it was over, I said 'did you get what you wanted?' ... I carried my torn clothes and cried and screamed, and cried and screamed. And nobody heard me.\"\n\nHiba describes audiences going from room to room at Zico House, a cultural center in Beirut, listening to six actors tell survivors' stories as part of an immersive play, organized by #ShameOnWho.\n\n\"It was moving.

We hear these stories on Facebook, or on TV but we never really encounter these people in our lives.\"\n\nBut Lebanon's civil society appears determined to give women a larger platform and counter social practices perceived as sexist.\n\nLast month, women's rights activists called for the boycott of the television channel MTV Lebanon after it aired an interview with Mohammed al-Nheily, the husband and convicted killer of 33-year-old Manal Assi, in a program on Lebanese prisoners called Out of Freedom. Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ...

And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not.

Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Chain restaurants are less healthy than fast food, global study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/V6mZto7rmAY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Fast food often gets the blame for calorific meals, but new research has found that your favorite chain restaurants are dishing up meals with even more excessive calories, worsening the global obesity epidemic.\n\nOverly large portions and food laden with sugar and fats are regularly being served in sit-down eateries, as well as fast food outlets, according to two studies published in the BMJ on Wednesday.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the problem -- which experts say is fueling obesity, pushing up rates of diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses -- is also not confined to the United States, the studies say.\n\nAlthough the poor nutritional content of fast food has been well-documented, there has been less research into the energy content of more traditional \"full-service\" or sit-down restaurants.\n\nOne UK study analyzed the calories in 13,500 main meals served in 27 UK restaurant chains, of which 21 were full-service restaurants and the remainder serving fast food. A US study measured calories in the most frequently ordered meals in 116 restaurants across five countries -- Brazil, China, Finland, Ghana and India -- comparing them against the United States.\n\nThe calorie content of the most popular meals in British and international restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations, the researchers found. In the global study, only China was found to serve \"significantly less energy than restaurants in the US.\"\n\nFast food, it concluded, contained on average 33% fewer calories than more formal restaurant meals.\n\nThe UK's health agency, Public Health England, recommended that lunches and evening meals should not exceed 600 calories (also measured as kcal). But almost none of the restaurants surveyed reflected this.\n\n\"We found that the number of calories in the average restaurant meal was more than the number of calories in the average fast food meal,\" said Eric Robinson, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, who led the UK study. \"A lot of people would expect there to be more calories in fast food, but our findings were counter to that.\"\n\n'Fast food comes out as the good guy'\n\nThe average main meal dish at a fast food chain in the UK contained 751 calories, compared with an average of 1,033 at sit-down restaurants. Only 11% of full-service dishes served at the 21 restaurants studied -- including Pizza Express, Zizzi and Wagamama -- met the recommended limit of 600 calories, though that rose to 17% in fast food meals.\n\nThese restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe worst-performing of the British fast food outlets, KFC, had an average of 987 calories per meal, but it fared better than more than half of the sit-down restaurants. Meanwhile, an average meal at Burger King (711 calories) proved less calorific than every one of the traditional restaurants surveyed.\n\nThe worst offenders were named as Hungry Horse, where the average meal contained 1,358 calories, followed by Sizzling Pubs (1,269 calories) and Flaming Grill Pubs (1,232 calories).\n\nSizzling Pubs' parent company, Mitchells and Butlers, said in a statement, \"We share nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests make knowledgeable decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us.\n\n\"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.\"\n\nThe other restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe international study, which didn't name specific restaurants, found an average of 809 calories in main meal dishes served by fast food chains and 1,317 calories in restaurant chains. Only the Chinese served fewer calories than Americans: 1,045 calories in full-service, compared with 1,362 in US eateries, and 561 in fast food restaurants, as opposed to 969 in America. Indian meals tended to be higher in calories; restaurants in the remaining countries were comparable to those in the United States.\n\nOnce again, a small minority of meals met the 600-calorie recommendation, with 94% of full-service dishes and 72% of fast food dishes exceeding this limit.\n\nRobinson said that although there is considerable debate in Britain about forcing restaurants to display calorie content, only 9% of the meals his research covered met the maximum.\n\n\"So even if you want to know about calories on the menu, you are not left with many meals to choose from,\" he said. \"Restaurants need to serve fewer calories. There are a lot of meals that have far too many calories, whether it's due to portion sizes, ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n\"The bigger issue it relates to is that we are living in a food environment that encourages and causes people to eat more calories than they need,\" he said. \"If a government is serious about trying to reduce obesity and the number of people who die young because of poor diet and obesity, then the food environment is something that needs to be addressed and tackled.\"\n\nSusan Roberts, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, was the lead author of the international study. \"Until now, fast food has been criticized all the time, but in this study, fast food comes out as the good guy,\" she said. \"It was still bad, but it had 33% less calories than standard restaurants.\"\n\nPotential steps to be taken include reducing portion sizes or even introducing proportional prices for restaurant meals, Roberts said. In other words, people would be required to pay for the portions they ordered rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"I think that most of us would be delighted to be able to go into a restaurant and order the size that we actually want. But that would mean that restaurants would have to actually recognize that they are part of the problem, which I think they will deny,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe authors of both reports said no firm conclusions could be drawn, as both were observational. However, they also warned that their findings may not fully reflect the reality, as they did not take in to account drinks, appetizers, desserts or side orders.\n\n'Step up and take responsibility'\n\nCaroline Cerny, lead of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 British organizations and charities, noted that \"regularly eating excess calories over time leads to weight gain.\"\n\n\"Children these days are growing up in an obesogenic environment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to make healthy choices. That's why we welcome government proposals to introduce mandatory calorie labeling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaway. But we also need the whole food industry, including restaurants, to step up and take responsibility for making healthier eating easier, by reducing calories and sugar in their meals by 20% in line with government targets.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTam Fry, chairman of the UK's National Obesity Forum, welcomed the findings but said he thought Public Health England's 600-calorie recommendation was \"unrealistic\".\n\n\"We have all become so accustomed to eating so much more now that I think a more realistic maximum would be about 800 calories,\" he said. \"The restaurant industry has got to clean up its act, but I fear it won't do it voluntarily because they feel they will lose custom. So there must be some kind of regulation to bring them into line, or else they will be named and shamed.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: More assurances for MPs possible says May", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46569699", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:17", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it'\n\nTheresa May has said it is still possible to get the assurances MPs need to back her Brexit deal, despite EU leaders ruling out any renegotiation.\n\nAt a summit in Brussels, the UK PM said there was \"work to do\" but talks on \"further clarification\" would continue.\n\nShe admitted a \"robust\" discussion with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, after he complained about \"nebulous and imprecise debate\".\n\nLabour said the withdrawal deal was now \"dead in the water\".\n\nThe UK prime minister travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders after delaying Tuesday's Commons vote on the deal, in anticipation of a heavy defeat.\n\nShe then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her.\n\nMany of them are concerned that the controversial \"backstop\" plan in the withdrawal agreement Mrs May has negotiated, which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland, would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals.\n\nWhat was the \"nebulous\" row about?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker?\n\nAfter Mrs May addressed EU leaders at the summit on Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged further clarity from the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want... because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise.\"\n\nVideo footage of the two on Friday morning captured a tense exchange, apparently about his remarks, although the exact words were not audible.\n\nAsked about what she had said to him, Mrs May told reporters: \"I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker - I think that's the sort of discussion you're able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together.\n\n\"And what came out of that was his clarity that actually he'd been talking - when he used that particular phrase - he'd been talking about a general level of debate.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jean-Claude Juncker: \"We were not dancing...she thought that I did criticise her\"\n\nAt a later press conference, Mr Juncker described Mrs May as a \"good friend\" who he admired as a \"woman of courage\".\n\nHe said he hadn't realised nebulous was a word in English and he had been referring, not to her, but to the \"overall state of the debate in Britain\".\n\nHe said: \"I can't see where the British parliament is heading. That's why I was saying that it was nebulous - foggy in English - I was not addressing her.\"\n\nHe also said: \"We have to bring down the temperature\" of the debate amid \"attacks coming from Westminster against Europe and the European Commission\".\n\nDid the PM secure any concessions?\n\nImage copyright AFPp\n\nVarious EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker and Irish PM Leo Varadkar, reiterated on Thursday that there could be no renegotiation of the withdrawal deal.\n\nAnd a paragraph which had appeared in the draft conclusions at the start of the summit, saying that the EU \"stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided\" did not appear in the final conclusions.\n\nBut Mrs May said that, despite reports that the EU was unwilling to consider further clarification, she had talked to Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker and others that morning which \"have shown that further clarification and discussion following the council's conclusions is in fact possible\".\n\nShe also welcomed commitments by other EU leaders to try to get a new trade deal in place \"speedily\" so that the backstop would not be needed and said that, as formal conclusions from the summit, they had \"legal status\".\n\nBut she added: \"There is work to be done. It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarification. We will be working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need.\"\n\nBBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its \"best endeavours\" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet.\n\nWhat do the deal's critics say?\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May's Brexit deal is dead in the water. The prime minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal.\n\n\"Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the prime minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control.\"\n\nAnd Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: \"It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in.\"\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said she must deliver \"legally binding changes\" to the withdrawal agreement if she wants her deal to get through Parliament.\n\nIts leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister \"has made commitments\" to the DUP and \"knows what she has to deliver on\".\n\nMeanwhile, the UK and Switzerland have provisionally agreed to keep their current trading rules after Brexit, the first of 40 existing EU trade deals with other countries the UK hopes to adopt.\n\nThe agreement, which will replicate the EU's current arrangement with Switzerland as closely as possible, is due to come into place at the end of 2020 when the Brexit transition phase ends.\n\nBut it could come into force at the end of March if the UK leaves with no deal.\n\nAnalysis: Not a failure but unlikely to impress critics\n\nThe BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming\n\nTheresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure.\n\nShe has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary.\n\nIf the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its \"best endeavours\" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly.\n\nThe EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them.\n\nBut it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute.\n\nThe problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics.

It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarification. We will be working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need.\"\n\nBBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its \"best endeavours\" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet.\n\nWhat do the deal's critics say?\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May's Brexit deal is dead in the water.

That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly.\n\nThe EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them.\n\nBut it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute.\n\nThe problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics.

If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\n\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\n\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\n\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\n\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\n\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\n\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\n\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\n\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\n\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\n\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\n\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\n\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\n\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\n\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Overweight patient denied NHS operation by York CCG", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46568314", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright LDRS Image caption Roland Crooke was in \"huge pain\" when he was denied surgery\n\nA hip replacement patient took an \u00a311,500 loan to pay for an operation after the NHS postponed treatment due to his weight.\n\nRoland Crooke was in \"huge pain\" when he was denied surgery by Vale of York Clinical Commissioning Group [CCG].\n\nThe group's guidelines mean anyone with a body mass index higher than 30 must lose weight or wait a year for non-emergency procedures.\n\nBosses from the organisation said it has to make difficult decisions.\n\nMr Crooke, 67, told councillors on a City of York health, housing and adult social care committee that he was just weeks away from surgery when he learnt about the BMI guidelines.\n\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, he said: \"This is clearly a rationing measure dressed up in clinical clothes.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

I think [the U.S.] has more to offer than what was laid out here.\u201d\n\nChina-focused\n\nBolton mentioned China at least 15 times in his speech at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative, Washington D.C.-based think tank. South Sudan, the most-cited African country, came up just five times. There, Bolton said, the United States plans to revisit the assistance it provides in light of ongoing conflict.\n\nBolton had pointed criticism for Beijing. \u201cChina uses bribes, opaque agreements, and the strategic use of debt to hold states in Africa captive to Beijing\u2019s wishes and demands,\u201d he said. \u201cIts investment ventures are riddled with corruption, and do not meet the same environmental or ethical standards as U.S. developmental programs.\u201d\n\nHe cited debt concerns in Zambia and Djibouti, a new Chinese military base in Djibouti, allegations that China fired lasers at American pilots, and concerns that Djibouti might hand a strategic port over to Chinese companies.\n\nBolton painted Moscow in similarly negative terms, describing a government concerned only with self-interest. \u201cRussia advances its political and economic relationships with little regard to the rule of law or accountable and transparent governance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018The bigger chessboard\u2019\n\nThe Trump administration sees in its new strategy a sharpened focus that will deliver results. But framing the dynamics in Africa too narrowly could undermine both U.S. and African interests, Judd Devermont, the director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t see the bigger chessboard, you actually miss opportunities to advance U.S. interests and to improve African prosperity,\u201d Devermont said.\n\nThe new policy doesn\u2019t acknowledge many of the global players jockeying in Africa. India, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 all of whom Bolton left out of his remarks \u2014 have made significant investments in Africa, from the Horn to Johannesburg.\n\nA better approach for the Trump administration, Devermont said, would be to account for the many multilateral relationships unfolding in Africa. \u201cThey\u2019re major players putting [in] lots of money and advancing their goals, and we lacked from this administration [information] on how they are going to navigate that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Contra\u2019 diplomacy\n\nBolton also spoke of mutual respect, African agency and self-reliance. But how the United States will navigate relationships with African countries with extensive ties to either Beijing or Moscow is not yet clear.\n\nA policy predicated on antagonism toward China could prove tricky, though, in light of Beijing\u2019s extensive investments in nearly every country in Africa. To date, China has made more than $142 billion in loans to African countries, often with very favorable terms.\n\nWhether the United States will tie its aid and investment programs to recalibrated relations with Beijing remains unclear. But Bolton was firm that the U.S. should not assist nations working against its interests.\n\n\u201cCountries that repeatedly vote against the United States in international forums, or take actions counter to U.S. interests,\u201d he said, \u201cshould not receive generous American foreign aid.\u201d\n\nCooke worries that only investing in countries in close alignment with U.S. interests will produce short-term gains at a long-term cost.\n\n\u201cMy sense was that the administration will be looking for partners who support the U.S. \u2014 contra other great powers,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that can be problematic in the long run.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Russia: Allegations Against Butina Are 'Unfounded'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-allegations-against-butina-are-unfounded-/4700529.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:05", "body_paragraphs": "The Kremlin said Friday that the allegations against the Russian woman who pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to being a spy are \"unfounded.\"\n\n\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday,\"We consider the accusations against her as absolutely unfounded.\"\n\n\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he believed Maria Butina's guilty plea is part of a plea bargain \"... the likes of which are common in the U.S. ... part of a deal to get free and return home as soon as possible.\"\n\nButina pleaded guilty, however, Thursday in Washington to acting as a Kremlin agent to conspire to build ties with the powerful National Rifle Association gun rights group in the U.S. and infiltrate Republican Party circles to pass information back to Moscow.\n\n\n\nShe was charged in July with acting illegally as an unregistered Russian agent and conspiracy. She initially entered a not-guilty plea.\n\n\n\nBut Butina admitted to U.S. Judge Tanya Chutkan that she had, in fact, been working for the Russian government.\n\n\n\nAs part of an agreement with prosecutors to change her plea to guilty, the 30-year-old Butina agreed to help them with insight into Russian meddling in U.S. political affairs. Her actions were directed by Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia's central bank, who in April was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nButina faces up to five years' imprisonment and remains jailed while awaiting sentencing Feb. 12.

The payments, however, were not reported as campaign donations.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's efforts in early 2016 to build a Moscow skyscraper, to mimic Trump's false claim to voters that he had no Russian business ventures.\n\nU.S. Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley dismissed Cohen's interview, when asked by reporters Friday at the White House.\n\n\"The fact that the media is giving credence to a convicted criminal \u2014 you're giving credence to someone who's a self-admitted liar,\" Gidley said. \"For him to say, 'I'm going to start, I'm going to stop lying now, starting now' is somewhat silly.\"\n\nTrump has contended the hush money payments were not criminal. He told Fox News earlier this week the charges were brought by prosecutors \"to embarrass me. I never directed him to do anything incorrect or wrong.\"\n\nProsecutors said that Cohen, at Trump's direction, facilitated the payments, in violation of campaign finance laws, to Daniels and McDougal shortly before the 2016 election. The payments were intended to buy their silence about the alleged liaisons with Trump a decade before he sought the presidency.\n\nThe prosecutors said American Media knew corporations such as itself were subject to campaign finance laws that forbid payments \"made for purposes of influencing an election and in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or campaign.\" Prosecutors also said American Media did not report the payments to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nCampaign finance laws require campaign contributions to be disclosed and bar individual donations of more than $2,700.\n\nNew York prosecutors say then-candidate Trump was involved in making a $150,000 payment to McDougal through American Media Inc.\n\nThe company owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. The publication bought McDougal's story of her alleged 2006-2007 affair with Trump with the express purpose of killing it so it would not surface before Election Day in November 2016, to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.\n\nAmerican Media reached a deal with prosecutors to avoid prosecution by fully cooperating with authorities disclosing its role with Trump in making the payment to McDougal.\n\n'Blind loyalty'\n\nCohen was sentenced after telling a federal judge that his \"blind loyalty\" to Trump led him to \"cover up his dirty deeds.\"\n\nLegal analysts said the developments could strengthen a potential case against Trump himself if prosecutors were to pursue one, although Justice Department guidelines say that a sitting president cannot be charged criminally until he leaves office.\n\nCohen is the closest figure to Trump sentenced to prison in the wide-ranging investigations of Trump's 2016 campaign, its possible links to Russia and whether Trump, as president, obstructed justice by trying to thwart probes by federal prosecutors in New York and Mueller in Washington.\n\nSeveral other prominent Trump figures, including his former campaign chairman and his first national security adviser, have yet to be sentenced for various offenses.\n\nCohen once bragged that he would \"take a bullet\" to support Trump. More recently, however, Cohen had turned against Trump and said at his sentencing that working for Trump was a \"personal and mental incarceration.\"\n\nCohen attorney Lanny Davis said that after Mueller completes his investigation, Cohen would cooperate with congressional committees as they consider possible wrongdoing by Trump and his aides.

Tunisia leads the northern Africa region in women\u2019s rights and government representation, but at least 47 percent of the country\u2019s women are affected by domestic violence. Law 58, which took effect in February, offered sweeping protections from physical, economic and psychological abuse, and even outlawed harassment in public.\n\nBut nongovernmental organizations, government officials and survivors of domestic violence who met late last month to assess how the law is being implemented reported a host of shortcomings, from logistical barriers that prevent some women from filing complaints to social pressures that keep others from even trying.\n\nOne woman told the conference of the trouble she faced when filing a report against her husband for assault and economic exploitation. She said police at a local station sent her to a district office so she could file the complaint with a specialized unit, but authorities there turned her away. She eventually managed to take her case to court, but said she was disappointed when the judge only fined her husband 300 dinar, or roughly $100.\n\nThe story illustrates some of the common problems women in Tunisia have been facing as they seek protection under a law that seemed perfect on paper.\n\n\n\nHurdles To Reporting\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to reporting crimes under the new law is the lack of agents trained to handle them, conference participants said.\n\nNabiha Gaddechi, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said 264 agents have completed training and hundreds more are in the pipeline. But the new units specializing in violence against women are still short-staffed, causing hiccups in the report-filing process.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Tunisian Parliament in October 2017.\n\nWomen who head to their local police station to file domestic violence reports are often sent to district offices, which tend to be located in less accessible areas, Gaddechi said. Once there, she added, victims often aren\u2019t offered a private space to file their reports and must do so in the open, sometimes among criminal suspects awaiting processing. Women also can\u2019t file reports at night, which is when most incidents of violence occur. Gaddechi attributed these problems to a lack of staff.\n\nConference participants said there are also many social norms that may lead people to tolerate or even justify violence against women.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs is monitoring whether religious messages are interfering with the application of the law, according to spokesman Slim Bencheikh. However, some agents have abused their power and pressured women against taking their spouses to court, Gaddechi said. She pointed out that this is a clear violation of the law, which states that \u201cany agent who is a part of the specialized unit for investigations into violent offenses against women and who voluntarily exerts pressure, or any sort of coercion, on victims for the purpose of making them give up their rights, change their complaint, or retract it will be punished by one to six (6) months in prison.\u201d\n\nTrouble In The Courts\n\nWomen continue to face challenges, even if they successfully file a report.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many specialized courts equipped to handle cases related to violence against women, said Raoudha Garafi, a court magistrate. Others noted how hard it is for some women to afford a lawyer.\n\nSana Ben Achour, the president of Association Beity, which runs women\u2019s shelters, said there were many reasons to consider punishing offenders in ways that don\u2019t include prison sentences. For one thing, conference participants pointed out, some women end up dropping charges against their husbands because they\u2019re afraid of being left as the only caretaker in their home.\n\nBen Achour said there were also problems with prisons.\n\n\u201cPrison has a positive, deterrent effect when it comes to fighting impunity, but it is also a problem because Tunisian prisons fail to have the corrective role they are supposed to,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the contrary, prisoners come out of them even more hateful.\u201d\n\nSome Good News\n\nDespite the hurdles, some progress has been made in the last year. The Ministry of Women, Family, Childhood, and Seniors set up shelters and listening centers for survivors of domestic violence around the country. A hospital in Tunis has also been equipped with new technology that makes it easier for medical staff to detect evidence of domestic abuse.\n\nParticipants at the meeting drafted recommendations for authorities and vowed to work together to improve the landmark law.\n\nIn the meantime, women\u2019s rights groups are also turning their attention to two new pieces of legislation that parliament is expected to vote on in coming weeks: an amendment that would make Tunisia the first country in the region to offer women equal inheritance to men, and a bill that would extend maternity and paternity leave for parents."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Myanmar Debates Women\u2019s Rights Amid Evidence Of Pervasive Sexual And Domestic Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myanmar-womens-rights-violence_us_5c113be9e4b03a134dc1c8f8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:13", "body_paragraphs": "By Stephanie Miedema and Tharaphi Than\n\nFor years, feminists in Myanmar have been fighting to gain even the most basic legal rights for women.\n\nSpousal abuse is still legal in the isolated country formerly known as Burma. Even criminal sexual assault is rarely punished.\n\nActivists\u2019 patient efforts to change that are starting to pay off.\n\nIn late November, officials announced that the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act, long stalled in parliament, may finally be passed in 2019. The bill would protect women from domestic violence, marital rape, sexual violence and workplace harassment, and provide legal and medical support to survivors.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge victory for the pioneering women\u2019s rights groups that helped draft the legislation first proposed in 2013.\n\nBut as revealed in our on-the-ground research on violence against women and gender inequality in Myanmar, the law is not the only thing that needs changing to keep its women safe.\n\nIntimate partner violence is common\n\nAcross the globe, violence against women \u2013 whether physical, sexual or psychological \u2014 is most likely to be perpetrated by their husband or boyfriend.\n\nThirty percent of women worldwide will be abused by a male partner during their lifetime, and the proportion is as high as 68 percent in some countries.\n\nData on intimate partner violence in Myanmar \u2014 which is run by a semi-authoritarian, military-heavy regime \u2014 is slim. But in 2016 the U.S.-funded Demographic and Health Survey, which is conducted in some 100 countries every five years, found that 21 percent of women there reported experiencing physical, sexual or psychological violence at the hands of an intimate partner, particularly slapping, pushing, choking and attacks with weapons.\n\nThe real percentage is likely much higher. Surveys on intimate partner violence typically produce lower-than-actual numbers, in part because many women don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe talking about assault.\n\nAccording to Legal Clinic Myanmar, a charity based in Yangon, 68 percent of the cases they attended in May 2018 concerned gender-based violence.\n\nEvidence also shows that women are more likely to experience violence in countries with high gender inequality. Myanmar ranks 106 of 189 countries in the U.N. Gender Inequality Index.\n\nAP Photo/Altaf Qadri A Rohingya refugee who fled Myanmar. She has convinced her husband to let their eldest daughter study.\n\nOur research sheds light on a high-profile U.N. report released in August, which documented widespread rape and sexual slavery in Myanmar\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Muslim Rohingya people.\n\nThe findings were disturbing. But, for us, they were not surprising. Violence against women is a silent emergency in all Myanmar.\n\nA false belief in gender equality\n\nUnequal gender relations in Myanmar stem from \u201chpon,\u201d a deeply held social belief that considers men to be holy, glorious and spiritually superior. Women are associated with ill omens and bad luck.\n\nHpon translates into both subtle and overt segregation by gender in Myanmar.\n\nPolitics is almost exclusively the domain of men, with women making up around 10 percent of national and state legislatures. In contrast, the male-dominated Myanmar military is guaranteed 25 percent of seats in all governing bodies.\n\nAP Photo/Thein Zaw Buddhism and the military are Myanmar\u2019s two biggest institutions. Both are male dominated.\n\nWomen in this Buddhist-majority country are not allowed to access certain religious spaces. Their garments are washed separately, so as not to contaminate men\u2019s clothing.\n\nThough hpon devalues women, we have found in interviews that people in Myanmar think that men and women enjoy equal status.\n\nThey point to women and men\u2019s relatively equal education levels, for example, or observe that women get to keep their last names after marriage. Women in Myanmar can also travel freely without a male escort, giving them relative independence compared to women in neighboring South Asian countries.\n\nPositive views of gender equality in Myanmar also celebrate a few very high-achieving women \u2014 most of them from upper-class backgrounds.\n\nThese exceptional figures include Queen Shin Saw Pu, who reigned the Mon Kingdom from 1453 to 1472, the 20th-century education campaigner Daw Mya Sein and leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 2015.\n\nDamir Sagolj/Pool Photo via AP Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi (left, with Chinese President Xi Jinping) is often cited as an example that women have equal opportunity in Myanmar.\n\nBlaming the victim\n\nBut the success of a few is not the same as equality for all.\n\nThe misperception of gender equality in Myanmar can actually make life harder for women who are seen to fall short of these high ideals, we found, because they feel like deviants in an otherwise equal and peaceful society.\n\nAfter a Myanmar model sued her boyfriend for rape in September 2018 \u2014 a very rare legal challenge in Myanmar \u2014 she was viciously attacked on social media, where she was called a \u201cprostitute\u201d and a \u201cwoman of low morals.\u201d She received hate mail suggesting she was better off dead.\n\nThe social stigma against sexual abuse and harassment in Myanmar society means most abuse survivors never report their experiences.\n\nMany women we interviewed have kept silent about domestic violence because they believe friends and family would say it was their \u201cwifely duty\u201d to be patient and quiet.\n\nOthers feared retaliation if they made their abuse known.\n\nGender inequality in Myanmar also limits women\u2019s ability to leave abusive relationships. Many women are financially and socially dependent on their partners, and would face social isolation, stigma and financial insecurity if they fled.\n\nMale-dominated institutions\n\nSince men dominate Myanmar\u2019s political, legal and criminal justice institutions, women also fear that reporting domestic violence will not protect them.\n\nOnly 1 percent of women who seek help after physical or sexual violence go to the police, according to the Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nWhen they do, they are not often believed.\n\nOne woman we spoke with said that she reported her violent husband to law enforcement, only to have her case dismissed. She said her husband paid the local police to ignore her.\n\nMyanmar society also typically turns a blind eye toward sexual abuse by soldiers and Buddhist monks, members of the country\u2019s two most powerful institutions.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s fitful transition from dictatorship toward democracy in recent years is giving women the opportunity, for the first time in history, to fight for their legal rights.\n\nIf the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act is passed next year, it will not fix the entrenched gender inequality that makes Myanmar women vulnerable to sexual violence.\n\nBut it is a critical step in the right direction.\n\nStephanie Miedema is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Emory University.

Although those addresses likely represent only a fraction of the hackers\u2019 overall effort \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear how many of the accounts were successfully compromised \u2014 they still provide considerable insight into Tehran\u2019s espionage priorities.\n\n\u201cThe targets are very specific,\u201d Certfa researcher Nariman Gharib said.\n\nAP Photo/Raphael Satter Certfa researchers Nariman Gharib, left, and Amin Sabeti, shown at a cafe in London on Dec. 7, 2018. Certfa helped uncover the Charming Kitten campaign.\n\nIn a report published Thursday, Cerfta tied the hackers to the Iranian government, a judgment drawn in part on operational blunders, including a couple of cases where the hackers appeared to have accidentally revealed that they were operating from computers inside Iran. The assessment was backed by others who have tracked Charming Kitten. Allison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks, recognized some of the digital infrastructure in Certfa\u2019s report and said the hackers\u2019 past operations left little doubt they were government-backed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear-cut,\u201d she said.\n\nCalls to Iranian officials were not returned late Wednesday, the beginning of the weekend in the country.\n\nIran has previously denied responsibility for hacking operations, but an AP analysis of its targets suggests that Charming Kitten is working in close alignment with the Islamic Republic\u2019s interests. The most striking among them were the nuclear officials \u2014 a scientist working on a civilian nuclear project for the Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense, a senior operator at the Research and Training Reactor in the Jordanian city of Ramtha, and a high-ranking researcher at the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.\n\nThe trio suggested a general interest in nuclear technology and administration. Others on the hit list \u2014 such as Guy Roberts, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs \u2014 pointed to an eagerness to keep track of officials charged with overseeing America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been worried about,\u201d Roberts said when alerted to his presence on the list.\n\nStill more targets are connected to the Iran deal \u2014 a 2015 pact negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and other world powers that called for Tehran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump tore up the deal in May over the objections of most of America\u2019s allies and has re-imposed a series of punishing restrictions on Iran since.\n\nOne of Charming Kitten\u2019s targets was Andrew J. Grotto, whose tenure on the U.S. National Security Council straddled the Obama and Trump administrations and who has written about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nJarrett Blanc, the State Department coordinator responsible for the implementation of the nuclear deal under Obama, was also on the list. He said news of his targeting was no shock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve retained contact with Iranian counterparts since leaving government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if there were not Iranian groups trying to hack into my various email accounts.\u201d\n\nLike the Russian hackers who have chased after America\u2019s drone, space and submarine secrets, the list indicates that Iranian spies were also interested in the world of U.S. defense companies. One of those targeted is a senior director of \u201cbreakthrough technology\u201d at the aerospace arm of Honeywell International Inc., the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate; another is a vice president at Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp., a prominent Pentagon contractor.\n\nHoneywell said it was aware that one of its employees had their personal account \u201cexposed,\u201d adding that there was no evidence that the company\u2019s network was compromised. SAIC said it found no trace of any hacking attempt against its employee\u2019s account.\n\nThere were Iranian targets too, including media workers, an agronomist and a senior employee of the country\u2019s Department of Environment \u2014 a possible sign that Tehran\u2019s crackdown on environmentalists, which began earlier this year, continues apace.\n\nHacking has long been a feature of the tense relationship between the United States and Iran, whose militant brand of Shia Islam has challenged American interests in the Middle East since 1979.\n\nIt was against Iran that U.S. and Israeli spies are said to have deployed the pioneering, centrifuge-rattling computer worm dubbed Stuxnet in a bid to sabotage the country\u2019s uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian hackers in turn are blamed for denial of service assaults on American banks and computer-wrecking cyberattacks in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s regional archrival.\n\nThe Charming Kitten campaign uncovered by Certfa is far less sophisticated, generally relying on a password-stealing technique called phishing. Two Nov. 17 emails provided to the AP by Jim Sisco of Enodo Global Inc., a Virginia-based risk advisory firm that was targeted by Charming Kitten, mimic the look and feel of Gmail security alerts, a technique used by hackers across the globe.\n\nAn analysis of Certfa\u2019s data shows the group targeted at least 13 U.S. Treasury employees\u2019 personal emails, including one belonging to a director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which fights money laundering and terror financing, and one used by the Iran licensing chief at the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is in charge of enforcing U.S. sanctions. But a few employees\u2019 LinkedIn profiles referenced back office jobs or routine tax work.\n\nThat suggested \u201ca fairly scattershot attempt,\u201d said Clay Stevenson, a former Treasury official who now consults on sanctions and was himself targeted by Charming Kitten.\n\nOthers\u2019 experience suggests a more professional effort.\n\nGeorgetown University professor and South Asia security expert Christine Fair said she had only recently returned from a conference in Afghanistan attended by Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian border when she learned she was in the hackers\u2019 sights.\n\n\u201cThe timing is uncanny,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Charming Kitten target was an intern working for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that has been one of the Iran deal\u2019s fiercest critics. How the intern \u2014 whose email isn\u2019t public and whose name appears nowhere on the organization\u2019s website \u2014 crossed the hackers\u2019 radar is not clear. The foundation issued a statement calling the revelation \u201cyet another indicator that Iran must be viewed as a nefarious actor in all theatres in which it operates.\u201d\n\nKagan, the scholar, said most signs pointed to a serious, state-backed operation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like freelancers,\u201d he said.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Detention Of 2 Canadians Raises Stakes In China-U.S.-Canada Dispute", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/detention-of-2-canadians-raises-stakes-in-china-us-canada-dispute_us_5c123049e4b0835fe326d084", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:14", "body_paragraphs": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Thursday confirmed it has detained two Canadian men, raising the stakes in a three-way international dispute over the case of a Chinese telecoms executive facing possible extradition from Canada to the United States.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of \u201cengaging in activities that endanger the national security\u201d of China.\n\nLu said Canada was informed about the detentions, but declined to say whether the men have been provided with lawyers. He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living.\n\n\u201cThe legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,\u201d Lu told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The U.S. has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud.\n\nCanadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor \u201csince he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,\u201d Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume B\u00e9rub\u00e9 said Wednesday. \u201cWe are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nKovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong.\n\nSpavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North\u2019s government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North\u2019s capital Pyongyang in 2013.\n\nAcquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up.\n\nThe detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt\u2019s detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada\u2019s arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the U.S.\n\nThe broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe root of the dispute appears to be Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nChina earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn\u2019t released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d if Canada doesn\u2019t free Meng.\n\n\u201cIf Canada extradites Meng to the U.S., China\u2019s revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,\u201d Hu Xijin said, speaking in English.\n\nCanada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters.\n\nThe United States and China have emphasized that China-U.S. trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction Tuesday, saying he\u2019d intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China.\n\n\u201cIf I think it\u2019s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u2014 which is a very important thing \u2014 what\u2019s good for national security \u2014 I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump\u2019s assertion, saying: \u201cRegardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was \u201cquite obvious\u201d any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure \u201cthe process is not politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,\u201d said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the U.S.\u2018s reputation as a country that follows the \u2018rule of law,\u2019 and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea.\n\nU.S. regulators planned to bar it from receiving U.S. components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because U.S. tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what he actually decides,\u201d Ross said. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we go from there.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Tax Return Shows Mercer Family Funded Climate Skeptics Last Year With More Than $4 Million", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-return-shows-mercer-family-fueled-climate-skeptics_us_5c12be38e4b0cce3ea29d15f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:14", "body_paragraphs": "Photo by Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post via Getty Images. Billionaires Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah attend a conference on climate change hosted by The Heartland Institute in 2017.\n\nBy Andrew Perez, MapLight\n\nA controversial family credited with helping Donald Trump win the White House spent $4.4 million in 2017 to finance climate change deniers, according to its foundation\u2019s latest tax return filed in November.\n\nThe Mercer Family Foundation, led by Rebekah Mercer and funded by her billionaire father, Robert Mercer, donated almost $4 million in 2016 to organizations that reject the scientific consensus regarding man-made climate change or oppose more regulations on carbon emissions, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe new details about the Mercers\u2019 continued support for climate change skeptics come on the heels of a U.N. report that found that humans have only 12 years to significantly reduce carbon emissions or face a global catastrophe \u2014 with more extreme weather and rising sea levels likely to cause mass displacement of people.\n\nThe Mercers gave $800,000 last year to the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based think tank that argues that the science on climate change is uncertain. The family has contributed $6.7 million to the institute since 2008. Their foundation donated $170,000 last year to the CO2 Coalition, a nonprofit that touts the benefits of carbon emissions; it gave $150,000 to the coalition in 2016.\n\nThe Energy & Environment Legal Institute, a coal-funded nonprofit that uses lawsuits and public record requests to challenge environmental regulations and climate scientists, emerged as a new recipient of Mercer family largesse in 2017. The Mercers donated $200,000 to the institute, which had previously sued a handful of state attorneys general investigating whether ExxonMobil misled the public about the dangers of climate change.\n\nThe Mercer Family Foundation contributed to four other organizations that have promoted climate change skepticism, including the Media Research Center ($2 million), the Cato Institute ($300,000), the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research ($450,000), and the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine ($500,000).\n\nThe Mercers were among the biggest boosters of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The family was closely aligned with Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist and Trump campaign CEO, and funded his conservative news outlet, Breitbart. The Mercers directed and funded a pro-Trump super PAC. They also owned a stake in Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for the Trump campaign and abruptly shut down after it was revealed that the company had harvested private information from the profiles of tens of millions of Facebook users.\n\nLate last year, Robert Mercer announced his resignation as co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, amid outrage over his family\u2019s association with Trump and their financial support for a former Breitbart writer with reported ties to white nationalists."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "More Than 300 Local Officials From 40 States Call For Green New Deal, End Of Fossil Fuels", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-local-officials_us_5c13df27e4b049efa7520236", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:14", "body_paragraphs": "In a little over a month, the so-called Green New Deal has won endorsements from more than three dozen sitting or incoming federal lawmakers as Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) makes a high-profile bid to shift debate over climate change toward policy on the scale of the crisis.\n\nOn Friday, the effort got a boost from 311 state and local officials.\n\nForty-four mayors, 63 county and state legislators and 116 city council members were among the officials from 40 states \u2015 including some top oil and gas producers \u2015 who signed an open letter issuing a sweeping, full-throated call for the phaseout of fossil fuels and adoption of Green New Deal-style climate policies.\n\nOne signatory, L.W.

Founded in 2009, it claims to power nearly 10 percent of Internet requests globally and has been widely criticized for refusing to regulate access to its services.\n\nAmong Cloudflare\u2019s millions of customers are several groups that are on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations, including al-Shabab, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, al-Quds Brigades, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and Hamas \u2014 as well as the Taliban, which, like the other groups, is sanctioned by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). These organizations own and operate active websites that are protected by Cloudflare, according to four national security and counterextremism experts who reviewed the sites at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nIn the United States, it\u2019s a crime to knowingly provide tangible or intangible \u201cmaterial support\u201d \u2014 including communications equipment \u2014 to a designated foreign terrorist organization or to provide service to an OFAC-sanctioned entity without special permission. Cloudflare, which is not authorized by the OFAC to do business with such organizations, has been informed on multiple occasions, dating back to at least 2012, that it is shielding terrorist groups behind its network, and it continues to do so.\n\nA pop-up message from Cloudflare on an official Taliban website.

Many of the designated groups, the EFF has argued, also provide humanitarian assistance to their constituents.\n\nBut so far, free speech advocates\u2019 arguments haven\u2019t carried the day \u2014 which means that Cloudflare still could be breaking the law.\n\n\u2018We Try To Be Neutral\u2019\n\n\u201cWe try to be neutral and not insert ourselves too much as the arbiter of what\u2019s allowed to be online,\u201d said Cloudflare\u2019s general counsel, Doug Kramer. However, he added, \u201cwe are very aware of our obligations under the sanctions laws. We think about this hard, and we\u2019ve got a policy in place to stay in compliance with those laws.\u201d He declined to comment directly on the list of websites HuffPost provided to Cloudflare, citing privacy concerns.\n\nCloudflare secures and optimizes websites; it is not a domain host. Although Cloudflare doesn\u2019t host websites, its services are essential to the survival of controversial pages, which would otherwise be vulnerable to vigilante hacker campaigns known as distributed denial-of-service attacks. As the tech firm puts it, \u201cThe size and scale of the attacks that can now easily be launched online make it such that if you don\u2019t have a network like Cloudflare in front of your content, and you upset anyone, you will be knocked offline.\u201d\n\nSome of the terrorist sites that HuffPost identified on its server have been used to spread anti-state propaganda, claims of responsibility for terrorist attacks, false information and messages glorifying violence against Americans and civilians. But none of that really matters: Even if al-Shabab were posting cat videos, it would still be a crime to provide material support to the group.\n\n\u201cThis is not a content-based issue,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, the editor in chief of Lawfare and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201c[Cloudflare] can be as pure-free-speech people as they want \u2014 they have an arguable position that it\u2019s not their job to decide what speech is worthy and what speech is not \u2014 but there is a law, a criminal statute, that says that you are not allowed to give services to designated foreign terrorist organizations. Full stop.\u201d\n\nIntermediary websites are shielded from liability for illicit third-party content on their platforms, thanks to the U.S. Communications Decency Act (meaning, for example, that Twitter cannot be held legally accountable for a libelous tweet). This immunity is irrelevant with regard to the material support statute of the USA Patriot Act, which pertains strictly to the provision of a service or resource, not to any offending content, explained Wittes. In this case, Cloudflare\u2019s accountability would not be a question of whether it should be monitoring its users or their content but, in part, whether the company is aware that it is serving terrorist organizations.\n\n\u201cIf and when you know or reasonably should know, then you\u2019re in legal jeopardy if you continue to provide services,\u201d said University of Texas law professor Bobby Chesney.\n\nIn its terms of use, Cloudflare reserves the right to terminate services \u201cfor any reason or no reason at all.\u201d Yet the firm has refused to shut down even its most reprehensible customers, with very few exceptions. Its CEO, former lawyer Matthew Prince, has made it clear that he believes in total content neutrality and that Cloudflare should play no role in determining who\u2019s allowed online. His company is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering that would value it at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nThere is a law \u2014 a criminal statute \u2014 that says that you are not allowed to give services to designated foreign terrorist organizations. Full stop. Benjamin Wittes, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\n\nCloudflare\u2019s services range in price from completely free to north of $3,000 per month for advanced cybersecurity. (Kramer declined to say if the sanctioned entities HuffPost identified are paying customers. Material support law applies to both free and paid services.) Its reverse proxy service reroutes visitors away from websites\u2019 IP addresses, concealing their domain hosts and giving them a sense of anonymity. This feature has made Cloudflare especially appealing to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, pedophiles, conspiracy theorists \u2014 and terrorists.\n\nCloudflare Knows\n\nCloudflare has knowingly serviced terrorist-affiliated websites for years. In 2012, Reuters confronted Cloudflare about websites behind its network that were affiliated with al-Quds Brigades and Hamas. Prince argued that Cloudflare\u2019s services did not constitute material support of terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re not sending money, or helping people arm themselves,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling bullets. We\u2019re selling flak jackets.\u201d\n\nThat analogy bears little relevance. \u201cMaterial support,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, refers to \u201cany property, tangible or intangible, or service,\u201d excluding medicine and religious materials. Contrary to Prince\u2019s suggestion, it applies to more than money and weapons. A New York man who provided satellite television services to Hezbollah was sentenced in 2009 to 69 months in prison for material support of terrorism. And although the definition is broad, \u201cit really covers anything of value,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be like a full-fledged embargo.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, after journalist James Cook learned Cloudflare was securing a website affiliated with al Qaeda, he wrote an article arguing that the web giant was turning \u201ca blind eye to terrorism.\u201d Prince published his responses to Cook\u2019s questions about serving terrorist groups in a Q&A-style blog post titled \u201cCloudflare and Free Speech.\u201d\n\nCook asked what safeguards Cloudflare had in place to ensure it was not supporting illegal terrorist activity; Prince listed none. Cook inquired whether Cloudflare would investigate the website he had identified; Prince suggested it would not. The site is still online and is still secured by Cloudflare.\n\n\u201cA website is speech. It is not a bomb,\u201d Prince wrote in his post. \u201cWe do not believe that \u2018investigating\u2019 the speech that flows through our network is appropriate. In fact, we think doing so would be creepy.\u201d\n\nCreepy or not, if a company receives a tip that it has customers who are sanctioned terrorists or has reason to believe that could be the case, it should absolutely investigate so as not to risk breaking the law, experts said.

Prince hinted that government authorities had ordered Cloudflare to keep certain controversial pages online. The FBI, Justice Department, State Department, Treasury Department and White House declined to comment on that assertion.\n\nLast year, Cloudflare disclosed that the FBI subpoenaed the company to hand over information about one of its customers for national security purposes. The FBI, which also uses Cloudflare\u2019s services, rescinded the subpoena and withdrew its request for information after Cloudflare threatened to sue. Neither Cloudflare nor the FBI would comment on this matter.\n\nOver the past two years, the Counter Extremism Project, a nonpartisan international policy organization, has sent Cloudflare four detailed letters identifying a total of seven terrorist-operated websites on its server. HuffPost has viewed these letters, which explicitly address concerns about material support of terrorism, and Kramer acknowledged that Cloudflare received them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never received a response from [Cloudflare],\u201d said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a content review specialist at the Counter Extremism Project. Five of the seven flagged websites remain online behind Cloudflare today, more than a year after they were brought to the firm\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re doubling down on free speech absolutism at all costs,\u201d he added. \u201cIn this case, that means they\u2019re going to allow terrorist and extremist organizations to use their services and to possibly spread propaganda, try to recruit or even finance on their websites.\u201d\n\nHuffPost In August 2017, Cloudflare cut off services to the Daily Stormer, a website that had allegedly been involved in a neo-Nazi rally that month in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counterprotester was killed.\n\n\u2018Assholes\u2019 vs. Terrorists\n\nKramer said he was not able to comment in detail on specific cases in which outside actors such as journalists and Anonymous informed Cloudflare about possible terrorist organizations using its services, but he noted that Cloudflare works with government agencies to comply with its legal obligations.\n\n\u201cOur policy is that if we receive new information that raises a flag or a concern about a potentially sanctioned party, then we\u2019ll follow up to figure out whether or not that\u2019s something that we need to take action on,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the challenge is really to determine which of those are legitimate inquiries and which of those ... are trying to manipulate the complaint process to take down people with whom they disagree.\u201d\n\nCloudflare was flooded with such complaints in August 2017, when activists pleaded with the firm to terminate its services for the Daily Stormer, a prominent neo-Nazi website that was harassing the family of a woman who had recently been killed in violence surrounding a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nPrince initially refused to drop the Daily Stormer, but as public outrage intensified, he reluctantly pulled the plug. \u201cThe people behind the Daily Stormer are assholes and I\u2019d had enough,\u201d he later said in an email to his team.

At the time, administration officials said they had no reason to believe those reductions, including the end of TV advertising, would cause fewer people to sign up.\n\nBut in a series of email conversations last year, analysts at a private contractor and senior staff at the agency in charge of HealthCare.gov discussed an econometric model designed to predict the likely effect of changes to the advertising budget.\n\nWeeks before the announcement of the cut, one of the analysts cited a prediction that enrollment would fall by 102,029 without television spots promoting HealthCare.gov and the availability of coverage on the site. The estimate, which the analyst described as \u201cvery conservative,\u201d covered just a portion of the advertising cuts.\n\nThe decision was one in a series of actions, such as yanking funds from organizations that help people enroll, that seemed consistent with Trump\u2019s vow last year that he would \u201clet Obamacare fail.\u201d\n\nMany experts believe the cumulative effect of these steps over the past two years helps explain why the number of uninsured Americans is edging back up after hitting a record low during the Obama administration and why sign-ups at HealthCare.gov this year are lagging last year\u2019s pace, although open enrollment doesn\u2019t end until Saturday.\n\nWhat The Emails Say\n\nThe emails, which the left-leaning watchdog group Democracy Forward obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and then provided to HuffPost, start in January 2017, when Trump became president. One of his administration\u2019s very first moves was to cut off advertising for the remainder of the 2017 open-enrollment period, which still had a few days to go.\n\nThat turned out to be a harbinger. At the end of August, the administration announced it was wiping out nearly the entire promotional budget. Instead of allocating $100 million, as the Obama administration had done for the final year of enrollment it was overseeing, the Trump administration would spend just $10 million. It would also be focusing exclusively on digital advertising and outreach, with no funding at all for television.\n\nCourtesy of DEMOCRACY FORWARD Email from the conversation between analysts at a private contractor and senior staff at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in which they discuss projections for how reallocating television ad money would affect enrollment.\n\nAt the time, officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said that they were simply bringing the advertising budget in line with other, more established programs \u2015 and that everybody knew about the new markets already.\n\nOfficials also said the decision would not hurt enrollment, distributing a fact sheet with the announcement that said, \u201cNo correlation has been seen between Obamacare advertising and either new enrollment or effectuated enrollment.\u201d\n\nOn a conference call with reporters, in response to a question about whether the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes CMS) had studied the efficacy of advertising, an official said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t done a specific study related to the public awareness of the program.\u201d\n\nBut Weber Shandwick, the public relations firm handling HealthCare.gov advertising, had built an econometric model to assess the effects of different advertising methods, such as text messaging, radio spots and digital ads. The model came up in multiple discussions between CMS senior staff and Weber Shandwick analysts.\n\nIn a March 23 email, for example, Chris Koepke, a career CMS staffer in charge of the strategic marketing group, wrote to Weber Shandwick analysts to ask if there had been \u201cany success noodling on the Young and Healthy question and the econometric model? We\u2019re getting very close to needing to answer questions in that area.\u201d\n\nIn April, Koepke wrote a group email with the subject \u201cUpdated Econometric Modeling Deck.\u201d In that message, Koepke wrote, \u201dHi everyone \u2013 I definitely want to dive into a few things more. But, I\u2019m going to send a few one off questions I\u2019d love answered asap as I\u2019m getting a lot of budgeting questions right now.\u201d\n\nThere are several other instances of both CMS and Weber Shandwick staff talking about the model and references to requests for information from political appointees who had decision-making responsibility over Affordable Care Act implementation. (One email addressed to Brian Colas, former chief of staff to CMS administrator Seema Verma, begins, \u201cBrian, as we discussed, this is the deck.\u201d)\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Fact sheet for reporters from the Department of Health and Human Services, distributed in August, 2017, with announcement of the Trump administration's 90 percent cut to advertising.\n\nBut the most telling discussions are probably a series of communications starting in late July about how to allocate advertising funding for 2018.\n\nIn one email, Seth Levin, head of the HealthCare.gov account at Weber Shandwick, wrote, \u201cSee the attached chart. ... I then looked at the non-tv plan \u2026 The difference is 102,029 enrollments. This is likely a very conservative number, and Greg [presumably another Weber Shandwick analyst] noted the impact could be much more significant.\u201d\n\nEmails in this exchange also include some references to a spreadsheet with the file name \u201cTelevision v. No Television.xlsx,\u201d although the spreadsheet itself was not included in the Freedom of Information Act disclosure.\n\nWhat The Emails Mean\n\nAll of the emails include large swaths of redacted material, making it difficult to decipher exactly what they show. But Joshua Peck, who was chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov during the Obama administration, reviewed the emails and said the significance should be clear to anybody who has worked on Affordable Care Act implementation.\n\n\u201cThis email shows us that when asked what would happen if the same money budgeted for TV was instead spent on other types of advertising,\u201d Peck said, referring to the message on TV ad projections, \u201cthey were told, very conservatively, at least 100,000 fewer people would enroll.\u201d\n\nPeck, who is a co-founder of the nonprofit organization Get America Covered, went on to note that because the Trump administration was wiping out nearly all advertising, not just television, the cumulative effect was likely much greater than 100,000. At the time of the announcement, he published an independent analysis predicting that enrollment would end up more than 1 million lower than it would have been if the ad budget had held steady.\n\nAnd although Peck said it\u2019s impossible to tell exactly who at CMS had seen the Weber Shandwick analysis, he said the thread \u201cdirectly contradicts the statement HHS made ... about not having any evidence of any correlation between the impact of outreach. When they made that statement, they were aware or could have easily discovered that there is abundant evidence of its impact.\u201d\n\nLast week, a CMS spokesperson responded to HuffPost\u2019s questions about the analysis by saying there was no clear relationship between advertising and enrollment. (Weber Shandwick referred questions to CMS.) The spokesperson noted, correctly, that overall enrollment had actually fallen in 2017, even though the Obama administration had put more money into promotion of the program that year, before rising back up in 2018, despite Trump\u2019s cut.\n\n\u201cWhen allocating funds for open enrollment advertising, the results of the prior two years were considered,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBut total enrollment is a function of many forces, including everything from the changing price of coverage to trends in job-based insurance, and the administration had additional reasons to think less advertising would be a force in the direction of lower enrollment.\n\nAfter studying the effects of outreach efforts in Kentucky, researchers at the Wesleyan Media Project concluded that less advertising could lead to \u201cweaker enrollment and a worsening risk pool for insurers.\u201d An internal study that the Obama administration commissioned found that advertising played a significant role in about one-third of both re-enrollments and new sign-ups at HealthCare.gov and that television had been especially effective when it worked in tandem with other forms of advertising.\n\nAnd after enrollment dipped for 2017, analysts went back to compare who signed up and when \u2015 and concluded that those cuts to last-minute advertising, right after Trump took office, likely played a big role.\n\n\u201cThe reason outreach and advertising matter is that there is a lot of turnover in the marketplace,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the independent nonprofit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cEach year, millions of marketplace enrollees become eligible for employer-based insurance or Medicaid as their circumstances change. Million more people become eligible for marketplace coverage on an annual basis, but they don\u2019t necessarily know it.\u201d\n\nWhat The Trump Administration Wants\n\nTrump administration officials bristle at the suggestion that they want the Affordable Care Act to unravel. \u201cI take exception to the claims that we are trying to sabotage Obamacare,\u201d Verma said in a speech this year. \u201cObamacare was failing long before Donald Trump became president.\u201d\n\nFew informed observers would dispute that problems associated with the Affordable Care Act have a lot to do with both its design and the decisions the Obama administration made while it was running the program.\n\nBut since taking office, Trump and his lieutenants have refused to defend the law in court, eliminated rules that steer people away from junk plans and used Affordable Care Act promotional funds to finance ads critical of the program. They also cut off critical funding for state-run insurance programs in Minnesota and New York, restoring the payments only after those states sued.\n\nAnd although Trump and his allies in Congress failed to pass legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act outright, the tax cut they enacted in late 2017 zeroed out the individual mandate, the financial penalty for people who decline to get insurance when the law deems it affordable."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "These Women Posed 'Nude' In The Middle Of London To Make A Point About Victoria's Secret", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nude-victorias-secret_us_5c118494e4b002a46c13e1bd", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:16", "body_paragraphs": "Goodbye, angels; hello, absolute badasses.\n\nJust days after the hotly debated Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show paraded its historically narrow-minded ideals of beauty down the runway for yet another year, seven women stripped down to their underwear to show the brand \u2015 and the world \u2015 what true diversity looks like.\n\nThey staged their protest outside a Victoria\u2019s Secret store in London\u2019s bustling Oxford Circus.\n\nJordan Smith\n\nJordan Smith\n\nThe idea was conceptualized by Joanne Morales and Sylvia Mac.

Their shared mission was to provide an example of what it\u2019s like be size inclusive but to also be inclusive of race, ability and both visible and invisible illness.\n\n\u201cWe were fed up seeing these so-called perfect body images online, with there being just one perceived beautiful body type,\u201d Mac told HuffPost.\n\nMorales, who launched Nunude in 2017 simply as an underwear brand catering to all sizes and skin tones, told HuffPost it has since evolved and reconsidered what its idea of diversity really is and its role in pushing that idea forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an underwear company providing skin tone underwear for women with the idea of loving yourself completely bare the way you are,\u201d she said.\n\nThat shared idea to change the scope of not only the fashion industry but the way women and people feel about their bodies drove them to plan the widely shared protest. Morales, Mac and five other women of different skin tones and sizes, some who are burn survivors, some with invisible disabilities, stood as one powerful unit in front of the Victoria\u2019s Secret store last week. They are pictured proudly posing in just bras and underwear.\n\nThe spectacle drew crowds of onlookers, who offered largely positive feedback. The supportive attention made it clear to Morales why what they\u2019re doing is so important.\n\n\u201cWe talked to little kids, older women, all different people of all different backgrounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were saying \u2018thank you so much,\u2019 they were crying. It\u2019s deeper for us, it\u2019s about making women feel beautiful. Especially as a brand owner, we are responsible for making women feel beautiful. If we\u2019re going to cater to their size, we should represent them.\u201d\n\nJordan Smith Passersby approached the protesters with questions and grateful tears.\n\nJordan Smith\n\nOf course, Victoria\u2019s Secret famously does not cater to all sizes, and the company\u2019s leadership has made clear its position on including both plus-size and transgender models on its runway. But brands like Nunude, which exclusively use fans and customers as models and believe in making room for all people to be included and represented in fashion, are the ones who will end up leading the charge for change.\n\nAs for the experience itself, Morales and Mac said the group was nervous beforehand \u2015 not just because they were planning to stand in the middle of a busy street in their underwear but also because of where they chose to get into said underwear.\n\n\u201cWe stripped inside the store,\u201d Morales said. \u201cIt was really nerve-wracking. We thought we would get chucked out. When we didn\u2019t, we were just walking around the store in our nude underwear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we went out of the store and turned around to see people filming us and coming to talk to us, it was a truly amazing day,\u201d Mac added.\n\nThere has, of course, been some negativity thrown their way, as is the case with almost everything on the internet. But Mac and Morales choose to focus on the positive and stress the importance of not judging a book by its cover.\n\n\u201cWhat some of the girls have been through, it\u2019s so admirable for them to get out there for all women,\u201d Morales said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to show that no matter what you go through, your visible and invisible scars, you shouldn\u2019t be judged.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Johnson & Johnson Knew About Asbestos In Baby Powder, Didn't Report To FDA", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johnson-and-johnson-baby-powder-asbestos_us_5c13bfc5e4b0f60cfa286b07", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:16", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.\n\nShe knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.\n\nCoker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? \u201cShe wanted answers,\u201d her daughter Cady Evans said.\n\nFighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that \u201cpoisonous talc\u201d in the company\u2019s beloved product was her killer.\n\nJ&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.\n\nCoker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. \u201cWhen you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nThat was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company\u2019s talc caused their cancers \u2014 including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.\n\nA Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company\u2019s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.\n\nThe documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators\u2019 plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.\n\nA small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.\n\n\u201cRATHER HIGH\u201d\n\nThe earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J\u2019s Italian supplier as fibrous and \u201cacicular,\u201d or needle-like, tremolite. That\u2019s one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.\n\nAt various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J\u2019s supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as \u201cfiberform\u201d and \u201crods.\u201d\n\nIn 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was \u201cdetected in any sample\u201d of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn\u2019t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc \u2013 in one case at levels reported as \u201crather high.\u201d\n\nMost internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J\u2019s testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected \u2013 and only a tiny fraction of the company\u2019s talc is tested.\n\nThe World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years\n\nlater. Just how small hasn\u2019t been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.\n\nThe evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they\n\nbegan demanding J&J\u2019s testing documentation.\n\nWhat J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn\u2019t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and\n\nother cancers, has had mixed success in court.\n\nIn two cases earlier this year \u2013 in New Jersey and California \u2013 juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.\n\nA third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J\u2019s potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.\n\nAt the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs\u2019 mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.\n\n\u201cJUNK\u201d SCIENCE\n\nJ&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, \u201cjunk\u201d science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,\u201d Ernie Knewitz, J&J\u2019s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters\u2019 findings. \u201cThis is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.\u201d\n\nJ&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.\n\nThe company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters\u2019 findings as \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d \u201cThe scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,\u201d Bicks wrote. \u201cThis is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson\u2019s cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos.\u201d He dismissed tests cited in this article as \u201coutlier\u201d results.\n\nIn court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up \u201cbackground\u201d asbestos \u2013 stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.\n\nThe company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades \u2013 in bottles from plaintiffs\u2019 cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J\u2019s corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users \u201cwould have, more likely than not, been exposed,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.\n\nMatthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: \u201cI have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,\u201d Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.\n\nSince 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys SA, a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Both companies said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the Paris-based company\u2019s tests \u201cconsistently show no asbestos. Talc\u2019s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.\u201d\n\nJ&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J\u2019s $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker\u2019s carefully tended image as a caring company \u2013 a \u201csacred cow,\u201d as one 2003 internal email put it.\n\n\u201cWhen people really understand what\u2019s going on, I think it increases J&J\u2019s exposure a thousand-fold,\u201d said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.\n\nThe mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn\u2019t shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company\u2019s Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had \u201cstrong grounds on appeal.\u201d\n\nJ&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: \u201cWe remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.\u201d\n\nGorsky\u2019s comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure \u2013 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.\n\n\u201cSAFETY FIRST\u201d\n\nIn 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the \u201cSafety First\u201d motto. Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.\n\nSoon, mothers began applying the talc to infants\u2019 diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\n\nIn the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That\u2019s one of six minerals \u2013 along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite \u2013 that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable \u201cnon-asbestiform\u201d rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.\n\nJ&J\u2019s worry at the time was that contaminants made the company\u2019s powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much \u201cgrit\u201d as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained \u201cfrom less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,\u201d described as mostly fibrous and \u201cacicular\u201d tremolite.\n\nMost of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company\u2019s talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was \u201ccleavage fragments\u201d from non-asbestiform tremolite.\n\nJ&J\u2019s original records don\u2019t always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, \u201cmakes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,\u201d agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.\n\nAnd as the product safety director for J&J\u2019s talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: \u201c(I)f a deposit contains \u2018non-asbestiform\u2019 tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cTHE LUNGS OF BABIES\u201d\n\nIn 1964, J&J\u2019s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.\n\nTen years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J\u2019s talc supply for decades.\n\nJ&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was \u201cnormal\u201d to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. \u201cHistorically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,\u201d Ashton wrote. \u201cHow bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?\u201d\n\nSince pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, \u201cit would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite \u2026 to an absolute minimum,\u201d came the reply from another physician executive days later.\n\nThe doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder\u2019s son and then-retired CEO, had expressed \u201cconcern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe have replied,\u201d the doctor wrote, that \u201cwe would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard.\u201d Such assurances would be impossible, he added, \u201cif we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.\u201d\n\nThe memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because \u201cit is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.\u201d\n\nNEVER \u201c100% CLEAN\u201d\n\nBy the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.\n\nRegulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon\u2019s newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.\n\nBy then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.\n\nThey shared their preliminary findings with New York City\u2019s environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.\n\nThe FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: \u201cOur fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.\u201d\n\nLater that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a \u201crelatively small\u201d amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.\n\nLanger, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of \u201cantagonistic personalities\u201d in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an \u201cattack on talc.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose I was antagonistic,\u201d Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn\u2019t find asbestos \u2013 a result that Mount Sinai announced.\n\nLanger said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.\n\nSelikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018How come it took so long?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nIn July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared \u201cevidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company\u2019s public relations department that J&J\u2019s talc contained trace amounts of \u201cfibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).\u201d\n\n\u201cINCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS\u201d\n\nAs the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount \u201cinsignificant\u201d and the samples \u201csubstantially free of asbestiform material.\u201d J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the \u201cresults clearly show\u201d the samples tested \u201ccontain no chrysotile asbestos.\u201d J&J\u2019s lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.\n\nBut J&J\u2019s FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson\u2019s finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample \u2013 \u201cincontrovertible asbestos,\u201d as he described it in a lab note.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: \u201cI understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.\u201d\n\nBy 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J\u2019s Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.\n\n\u201cIt is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,\u201d Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the \u201cprocess may well be valuable property to us.\u201d\n\nAt the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: \u201cWe will want to carefully consider the \u2026 patents re asbestos in talc. It\u2019s quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.\u201d\n\nJ&J did not obtain the patents.\n\nWhile Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company\u2019s Vermont mining operation. \u201cOccasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,\u201d he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. \u201cAnd these might be classified as asbestos fiber.\u201d\n\nJ&J should \u201cprotect our powder franchise\u201d by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that \u201cno final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles.\u201d Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, \u201cis obviously another answer.\u201d\n\nBicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.\n\nCornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative \u201cfor defensive reasons\u201d because \u201cthe thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS\u201d\n\nA few months after Petterson\u2019s recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency\u2019s cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.\n\nAt the time, J&J\u2019s Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for \u201can automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos.\u201d That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA\u2019s proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.\n\nThe same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, \u201cwe may have problems.\u201d\n\nThe best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company\u2019s own researchers had earlier used to identify a \u201ctremolite-type\u201d asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: \u201cIt may be too sensitive.\u201d\n\nIn his email to Reuters, J&J\u2019s lawyer said the lab supervisor\u2019s concern was that the test would result in \u201cfalse positives,\u201d showing asbestos where there was none.\n\nJ&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA\u2019s new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.\n\n\u201cIt was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,\u201d the minutes state.\n\nIn a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since \u201ca substantial safety factor can be expected\u201d with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, \u201cmethods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.\u201d\n\nNot everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it \u201cfoolish,\u201d adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: \u201cNo mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.\u201d\n\nPUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION\n\nHaving failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.\n\n\u201cThe attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,\u201d the cover letter said. \u201cWe are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.\u201d\n\nIn its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected \u201cin any sample.\u201d\n\nJ&J didn\u2019t tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J \u2013 \u201cfiberform\u201d actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as \u201casbestos fibers\u201d in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. \u201cSome of them seem rather high,\u201d the private lab wrote in its cover letter.\n\nBicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab\u2019s results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found \u201cwas not asbestiform,\u201d based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.\n\nJust two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, \u201cfibrous anthophyllite\u201d and other types of asbestos had been \u201cfound in association with the Hammondsville ore body\u201d \u2013 the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.\n\nZeitz\u2019s May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc \u201cstrongly urged\u201d the adoption of ways to protect \u201cagainst what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.\u201d\n\nBicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.\n\nThe following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, \u201cit can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION\u201d\n\nJ&J\u2019s selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge\u2019s decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. \u201cProviding the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,\u201d Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.\n\n\u201cJ&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge\u2019s comments,\u201d Bicks said. \u201cJ&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.\u201d\n\nThe FDA declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nLacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.\n\nInstead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.\n\nThe CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.\n\nX-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J\u2019s lawyer said the company\u2019s tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J\u2019s X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.\n\nBut the company never adopted the Colorado lab\u2019s 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn\u2019t guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.\n\nAs early as 1976, Ashton, J&J\u2019s longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, \u201cwill be hard pressed in supporting purity claims.\u201d He described this sort of testing as both \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFREE OF HAZARD\u201d\n\nBy 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J\u2019s \u201cDefense of Talc Safety\u201d campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be \u201cfree of hazard.\u201d It attributed \u201cthis growing opinion\u201d to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of \u201cfavorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency\u2019s investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. \u201cSo in subsequent analyzes,\u201d he told the paper, \u201cwe really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.\n\nIn 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder \u2013 to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.\n\nThe persistence of the industry\u2019s view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It\u2019s also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don\u2019t apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc \u2013 even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.\n\nUntil recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry\u2019s position, saying on its website: \u201cAll talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry\u2019s standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States \u201cshould be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.\u201d\n\nThe revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as \u201ccarcinogenic to humans.\u201d\n\nDespite the success of J&J\u2019s efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company\u2019s test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: \u201cThe samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.\u201d\n\nThen, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on \u201cimportant environmental issues\u201d in its talc reserves that there was \u201cpast tremolite\u201d in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.\n\nBicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, \u201cwere destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.\u201d\n\nBicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded \u2013 a finding deemed \u201cBDL\u201d \u2013 below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as \u201cbackground asbestos\u201d that did not come from any talc source.\n\nIn 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. \u201cI recognize the concern,\u201d he told Reuters. He said the agency\u2019s policing of cosmetics in general \u2013 fewer than 30 people regulating a \u201cvast\u201d industry \u2013 was \u201ca place where we think we can be doing more.\u201d\n\nGottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to \u201clook at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk.\u201d An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining \u201cscientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.\u201d\n\n\u201cFISHING EXPEDITION\u201d\n\nBefore law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn\u2019t exceed OSHA limits.\n\nThat\u2019s why he zeroed in on Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.\n\nHobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.\n\nJ&J objected. Hobson\u2019s \u201cfishing expedition\u201d would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson\u2019s request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company\u2019s Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite \u201casbestos\u201d needles.\n\nHobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker\u2019s lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had \u201cno evidence\u201d Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.\n\nTen days later, the pathology report landed: Coker\u2019s lung tissue contained tens of thousands of \u201clong fibers\u201d of four different types of asbestos. The findings were \u201cconsistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\u201cThe asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,\u201d Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J\u2019s dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.\n\nWithout evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.\n\nHobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: \u201cThey knew what the problems were, and they hid it.\u201d J&J\u2019s records would have made a \u201c100% difference\u201d in Coker\u2019s case.\n\nHad the information about asbestos in J&J\u2019s talc come out earlier, he said, \u201cmaybe there would have been 20 years less exposure\u201d for other people.\n\nBicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because \u201cthe discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff\u2019s disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.\u201d\n\nCoker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.\n\nCoker\u2019s daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.\n\n\u201cWhen Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,\u201d Deckard said. \u201cI have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "One Of Her Classmates Died By Suicide. Then Another.

They were about to be high school freshmen, and the group was buzzing with anticipation. Then, days before classes started, Hoston killed himself.\n\n\u201cHis mom found him in the basement,\u201d says 18-year-old Bella Price, one of his good friends and a classmate. \u201cIt was a big shock.\u201d\n\nHoston was popular and smart, according to people in Spring Hill, a tiny town of about 5,000 in Johnson County. He played football and basketball and even set a middle school record running track. He had a loving family. His friends couldn\u2019t make sense of what happened, says Price.\n\nThe next summer, another member of Price\u2019s class at Spring Hill High also died by suicide. This second death shattered the community.\n\nOver the last two decades, the suicide rate in America has risen 33 percent, according to statistics released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The country\u2019s life expectancy has declined over the last several years, and suicides are the biggest culprit, after drug overdoses. Among young people specifically, suicide is a leading cause of death.\n\nJohnson County \u2014 a predominantly white, affluent set of suburbs near Kansas City \u2014 saw itself as one of the most desirable places to live in the sprawling metropolitan area. So suicide was not a topic people here were prepared to confront. Since 2017, at least 14 students have taken their own lives, compared with five student suicides in the previous two years. Each new death brought a fresh wave of helplessness and isolation.\n\nIn response, the community is coming together to pull back the curtain on the uncomfortable topic of teen suicide and address it directly.\n\nLast spring, superintendents across the county\u2019s six school districts formed a coalition to make suicide prevention a top priority in schools. Over the next few months, the group met with mental health professionals, law enforcement, hospitals and faith leaders to come up with a plan to train students, teachers and parents to identify a young person in need and how to get them help.\n\n\u201cWe decided we need to come out and publicly talk about this,\u201d said Todd White, superintendent of the Blue Valley School District, where five students died by suicide between the spring of 2017 and spring of 2018. \u201cWe need to stop making suicide a subject that\u2019s taboo and let the kids help us figure out what to do.\u201d\n\nIt was White who first convened the superintendents. Their effort has since expanded beyond school walls, touching many aspects of life in the county. Though it\u2019s too soon to tell how effective it\u2019s been, the CDC says many suicides can be prevented if more people understand the warning signs and ways to intervene.\n\nDr. John Ackerman, suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, says communities need to talk openly about suicide. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be pulling drowning kids out of a river. We want to make sure they\u2019re not jumping into the rapids in the first place,\u201d he says.\n\nHere are stories from some of those whose lives have been touched by teen suicide and who have engaged in the effort to prevent more deaths.\n\nThe Student\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Price shows her phone screensaver, which features a photo of her and some friends, including Hoston.\n\nThe screensaver on Bella Price\u2019s phone features a photo of her friends, a grinning bunch crowded together on her family\u2019s basement steps. Bella\u2019s at the top, her red wavy hair tumbling down over her shoulders. Josh Hoston is right next to her with a mile-wide smile and his muscular athlete\u2019s arms folded across his knees.\n\nThree years after his death, Price and her friends are still grappling with the loss. The suicide of another classmate, Tai\u2019Shaughn Mathews, would eventually push Price to action. This fall, she became part of the \u201cteen council,\u201d a group of students from the six school districts in Johnson County who have come together to see how they can work to prevent any more of their friends and classmates from taking their own lives.\n\nThey\u2019re learning how to identify trusted adults and encouraging kids to tell someone when they\u2019re worried about a friend or classmate. They\u2019re studying warning signs from peers and working on a prevention campaign dubbed #zeroreasonswhy to change perceptions and behaviors associated with suicide.\n\n\u201cI want to be someone that people feel comfortable bringing their problems to, that someone felt that they could go to if they ever felt like there was no other way out,\u201d Price says.\n\n\u201cEveryone wishes that they could have reassured Josh that like, \u2018Hey, you could have come to me and I would have helped you with anything, no matter what.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Family\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Nathan and Sylvia Harrell lost their 17-year-old son, Chad, to suicide. A favorite photo (right) shows Chad as a 2-year-old being comforted by his older sister, Melanie.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Chad Harrell was angry his parents wouldn\u2019t let him go to a party on a Sunday night in June last year. The Friday before, they\u2019d found out he\u2019d been drinking and driving. His parents, Sylvia and Nathan, said they weren\u2019t grounding him, but they thought it was not appropriate he go to a party just two days later. Besides, they\u2019d planned a family night with his big sister.\n\nChad stuck around but when he was disengaged and silent, his dad sent him to his room.\n\nLater that night, his parents stopped by his room to say goodnight. He still seemed steamed. They told him they loved him and went to bed.\n\nKnowing Chad was upset, his mother opened his door to check on him just after midnight. Chad had killed himself.\n\n\u201cAnd that was the moment this unending nightmare began,\u201d Sylvia said.\n\nBoth parents said they were completely broadsided by Chad\u2019s choice.\n\n\u201cWe were the closest family I know,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take drugs. He wasn\u2019t a substance abuser. He was a fun-loving kid with a great sense of humor and great friends.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re reaching for any possible insights that might explain the loss.\n\n\u201cChad\u2019s personality from the time he was 2 was independent,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cHe\u2019d always say \u2018I do it, I do it,\u2019 if it was holding his hand while we crossed the street or putting butter on his bread.\u201d\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost The Harrells created a foundation called Keep the Spark Alive after losing their 17-year-old son, Chad (pictured), to suicide.\n\nThe suicide haunts Chad\u2019s 20-year-old sister, Melanie, too. They were best friends. She was in her room across the hall when he took his life. He\u2019d sometimes mention to her that he felt sad but didn\u2019t know why, that he had everything he wanted.\n\n\u201cI hate the idea he was right across the hall in his room and struggling so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be there in a heartbeat anytime he needed me, and that he felt so alone and couldn\u2019t reach out is hard.\u201d\n\nThe family has gone over and over how they might have missed any warning signs.\n\n\u201cAll his friends came over the next day,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cI asked them what they thought God was saying to Chad. Was he saying, \u2018Chad, good job! Way to go!\u2019 They were crying and shaking their heads. They knew he\u2019d made just one final, irreversible bad choice.\u201d\n\nFriends created a GoFundMe account that raised $90,000 after Chad\u2019s death. The family sponsored a golf tournament and raised another $150,000 to fund a new curriculum for students in elementary, middle and high school. It\u2019s designed to encourage kids to talk about their own sadness, depression or anxiety. For the older students, programs will start this winter to reduce stigma around mental health and engage parents and school staff as partners in suicide prevention. The Harrells have created a foundation called Keep the Spark Alive, after Chad\u2019s nickname. The family is in the early stages of collaborating with other efforts across Johnson County targeting the teen suicide epidemic.\n\n\u201cFrom the minute we lost Chad, we said the only way we\u2019re really going to get through this is to try and make a difference,\u201d Sylvia said. \u201cTo give these young people the tools to help each other reach out when suicide seems like the only option.\u201d\n\nThe Pastor\n\nJill Toyoshiba for HuffPost Adam Hamilton is pastor of United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in the Johnson County suburb of Leawood. Hamilton says he'\u0080\u0099s done 32 funerals for young and older people who'\u0080\u0099ve taken their own lives in the last two years.\n\nWhen school superintendents in Johnson County were discussing how to address the rising number of teen suicides, one of the first people they contacted was Pastor Adam Hamilton of United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in the town of Leawood.\n\nHamilton is nationally recognized as a pot-stirrer among his largely Republican flock, unafraid to tackle thorny issues like poverty or suicide.\n\nHamilton says he\u2019s conducted 32 funerals for young and older people who\u2019ve taken their lives in the past two years. That\u2019s more than he did over his last two decades at the church.\n\n\u201cOne thing you recognize when you\u2019re doing a funeral for a teenager,\u201d he said, \u201cis there are a whole lot of other teenagers there who\u2019ve also walked through dark circumstances and the likelihood they will see suicide as an option has increased dramatically. So we have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nAt a time when young people are said to be leaving the church, the charismatic pastor has been able to attract thousands of youth at four campuses across the Kansas City metro area.\n\nHe talks to them about reading the suicide note his grandmother left when his mother was just 16.\n\n\u201cI tell them she really felt she was doing them a service, relieving them of caring for her and her depression,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell them that the impact of her suicide is being felt by her family 60 years later.\u201d\n\nThe church has started education and awareness programs in the wake of the increase in teen suicides. It\u2019s held large and small meetups with counselors, mental health professionals and testimonials from survivors.\n\nHamilton hopes to switch the dialogue, to talk boldly and honestly about suicide to a generation accustomed to seeing an unvarnished version of life on social media.\n\n\u201cWe had a video of a man who\u2019d jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge and talks about regretting it the moment he jumped,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not talking about this from a theological, spiritual and pastoral perspective, then we\u2019re missing out on a huge piece of the puzzle around the number of teen suicides.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Kamala Harris: Black Mothers 'Must Be Given Dignity' In Health Care", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-black-mothers-must-be-given-dignity-in-healthcare_us_5c127a5fe4b002a46c1509f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:17", "body_paragraphs": "Sen.

The bill, called the Maternal CARE Act, creates incentives for medical schools to educate students about racial bias in maternal health care so that it can be prevented in the future.\n\nDuring her Wednesday address, Harris recalled seeing her mother, a scientist and breast cancer researcher, come home upset over the way women were treated by men in the health care system.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I became aware of and learned that these [gender] disparities exist,\u201d Harris said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Southwest Flight Delayed By 5 Hours After Someone Forgot To Unload A Human Heart", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/southwest-flight-delayed-by-5-hours-after-someone-forgot-a-human-heart-on-board_us_5c12ad6ce4b0449012f7fda9", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 19:04:17", "body_paragraphs": "Passengers on Southwest Airlines flight 3606 Sunday were shocked by a the reason why their plane, which was en route to Dallas, had to make a sudden turn and head back to its origin city of Seattle.\n\nApparently, someone had forgotten to unload a human heart, The Seattle Times reports.\n\nThe \u201clife-critical cargo shipment\u201d was supposed to be unloaded in Seattle and transported to an undisclosed local hospital, a representative from Southwest told HuffPost.\n\nA hairpin turn had to be made upon the organ\u2019s discovery so that it could be \u201cdelivered to its destination within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer,\u201d Southwest said.\n\nA passenger on the flight told the Times that his fellow passengers were initially stunned by the news.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me.

Weight training may not have the same effect, the study found, raising interesting questions about how various types of exercise affect us at a microscopic level and whether the differences should perhaps influence how we choose to move.\n\nThere is mounting and rousing evidence that being physically active affects how we age, with older people who exercise typically being healthier, more fit, better muscled and less likely to develop a variety of diseases and disabilities than their sedentary peers. But precisely how, at an interior, molecular level, exercise might be keeping us youthful has not been altogether clear. Past studies have shown that exercise alters the workings of many genes, as well as the immune system, muscle-repair mechanisms and many other systems within the body.\n\nSome researchers have speculated that the most pervasive anti-aging effects of exercise may occur at the tips of our chromosomes, which are capped with tiny bits of matter known as telomeres. Telomeres seem to protect our DNA from damage during cell division but, unfortunately, shorten and fray as a cell ages. At some point, they no longer safeguard our DNA, and the cell becomes frail and inactive or dies.\n\nMany scientists believe that telomere length is a useful measure of a cell\u2019s functional age.\n\nBut researchers also have found that telomeres are mutable. They can be lengthened or shortened by lifestyle, including exercise. A 2009 study, for instance, found that middle-aged competitive runners tended to have much longer telomeres than inactive people of the same age. Their telomeres were, in fact, almost as lengthy of those of healthy, young people.

His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said.
