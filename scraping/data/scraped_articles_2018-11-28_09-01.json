MUST WATCH Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\n\nTrump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.\n\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discrete public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been \"upset for weeks\" about \"the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nDetails emerge\n\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.\n\nIn the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it \"totally false and deliberately libelous\" and Wikileaks was \"willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nThe paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.\n\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.\n\nIn another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.\n\nIf there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.\n\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.\n\nPotential impact\n\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.\n\n\"What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\" Ben-Veniste said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.\n\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.\n\n\"A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.\n\nIn the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.\n\nExpectations high\n\nThe latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.\n\nMueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSo expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public\n\n\"Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\" said Ben-Veniste.\n\nSuch a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nThe new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.\n\nTrump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Nadler warns Trump 'dangling a pardon' for Manafort is 'close to obstruction of justice'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/5b7qSshlny0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The likely incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee warned President Donald Trump that \"even dangling a pardon\" for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort \"would fortify a claim or a charge of obstruction of justice.\"\n\n\"I suspect they're dangling a pardon in front of Manafort,\" Rep.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nOn the surface, Manafort's failed cooperation appears to be a setback for Mueller and a bullet dodged for President Donald Trump and administration insiders. But Mueller's ability to see through Manafort's lies and rip up the cooperation agreement bespeaks a deeper strength. By Monday's court filing, Mueller effectively declared: I have enough evidence to know Manafort is lying to protect others, and I don't need his half-baked cooperation to prove my case against them.\n\nAs a federal prosecutor, I dealt with dozens of cooperators, including gun and drug traffickers corrupt public officials , mafia leaders and murderers. I spent countless hours interviewing (or \"proffering,\" in the lingo) potential cooperators and assessing whether they were being honest and forthcoming.\n\nFederal cooperation is an all-or-nothing proposition; the cooperator must tell the prosecutor everything he knows about any crime that he or anybody else has committed. There are no half-measures. The cooperator cannot withhold incriminating information about certain people he wishes to protect. This selectivity is the most common cause of failed cooperation, and it appears to be Manafort's undoing here.\n\nWhatever the particular reason for the breakdown, there is no avoiding the conclusion that, had Manafort cooperated fully and truthfully, he likely could have done serious damage to high-ranking administration and campaign officials, including potentially Trump himself. Manafort spent five months as Trump's campaign chair, and he attended inner-circle meetings, including the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower sit-down between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and a group of Russians who were said to have offered to provide dirt on Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign.\n\nHad Manafort come clean, as required by his cooperation agreement, he could have walked Mueller into the inner sanctum of the Trump campaign during the key months leading up to the 2016 election, during which Russian intelligence agents hacked and disseminated the emails of Hillary Clinton and the DNC in an effort to undermine Clinton and help Trump's campaign. Doubtless, some within the Trump administration breathed sighs of relief when they learned that Manafort's cooperation had tanked.\n\nAt the same time, the very fact that Mueller saw through Manafort's lies -- and appears ready to prove to Manafort's sentencing judge that Manafort lied -- is a subtle but powerful show of strength.\n\nWhen a prosecutor pulls the plug on a cooperator because that cooperator lies, it typically happens not merely because the prosecutor senses in his gut that the cooperator is lying. More often, the prosecutor knows for a fact that the cooperator is lying because the prosecutor has hard evidence to prove the truth of the matter.\n\nHere, we know Mueller has the goods on whatever Manafort lied about -- and whoever Manafort felt a need to protect -- because he told the judge that he \"will file a detailed sentencing submission to the Probation Department and the Court in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the defendant's crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea agreement.\" Translation: Manafort lied, I know it, and I'll prove it at his sentencing if necessary. That should cause serious concern to whoever Manafort sought to protect by lying to federal prosecutors during his proffers.\n\nAs for Manafort himself, Anderson Cooper said it best: How frickin' stupid is this guy? Manafort, now 69 years old, already faced a sentence likely to keep him behind bars for most or all of his remaining life following his August trial conviction on eight crimes, including bank fraud and tax evasion. Manafort then pleaded guilty to additional crimes under a cooperation agreement, which provided him with one potential out: If he cooperated successfully, he could earn a \"5K letter\" from Mueller detailing Manafort's cooperation. (A 5K letter -- named after the relevant provision of the federal sentencing guidelines, section 5K1.1 -- is a letter from the prosecutor informing the judge of the details of the defendant's cooperation.)\n\nI've written many 5K letters, and I know that they can result in drastically reduced sentences. Now, however, Manafort has the worst of all worlds. He has been convicted at trial, he has pleaded guilty to additional crimes, he has broken his own cooperation agreement by lying federal prosecutors, and he has no chance at a 5K letter. Manafort paddled far upstream and now he has thrown his oar into the rapids.\n\nSo, why then would Manafort endanger himself by lying to Mueller? I see two possible explanations. One, perhaps Manafort is simply an arrogant, congenital liar. The trial evidence proved that Manafort believed he could spin a web of lies and get away with them. He got caught lying to banks and the IRS, and now, unsurprisingly, he has been caught by Mueller. Some cooperators understand that they are best served by telling the truth, for better or worse; others play games with prosecutors and end up getting burned.\n\nTwo, Manafort may be playing for a longshot pardon or commutation from Trump. It already has been reported, before Manafort's trial conviction and cooperation plea, that Trump at least discussed the possibility of pardoning Manafort.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPerhaps Manafort has determined on his own that his best chance to earn a pardon is to walk away from Mueller (though it is unclear why Manafort would curry favor with Trump by cooperating with Mueller and then lying; Manafort could have sent the same message of loyalty by refusing to cooperate at all in the first place). Or it is possible -- unproven at this point, but possible, given the chain of events -- that word somehow got to Manafort that, if he scuttled his cooperation with Mueller, he would be rewarded with a pardon. If that happened, then anybody who put the word out, or helped get it to Manafort, would face potential charges for obstruction of justice.\n\nThe failure of Manafort's cooperation at first glance seems like a setback for Mueller. But the fact that Mueller was able to call out Manafort's lies suggests he has plenty of evidence in hand to go after whoever Manafort sought to protect."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Anderson Cooper: Something must be weighing on Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/BFn47v1AvK4/mueller-investigation-trump-response-to-probe-manafort-cooper-kth-ac-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's Anderson Cooper argues that although President Trump has said there is no collusion, his response to mounting news about the Mueller investigation suggests the President is concerned about the end result."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Stone's efforts to seek WikiLeaks documents detailed in draft Mueller document", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/u8ND9XjawcA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Draft court filings obtained by CNN outline significant insights into what special counsel Robert Mueller may know about Roger Stone's efforts to seek documents from WikiLeaks in 2016.\n\nMueller's office was preparing to tell a federal court that Stone pushed an associate to get documents from WikiLeaks -- information that is now known to be stolen from the Democrats by Russian hackers -- that could help the Trump campaign, according to a draft of a court filing and other documents shared with CNN by Stone associate and conservative author Jerome Corsi.\n\nCorsi said he received the drafts, mostly dated this month, as part of his negotiations with Mueller's team regarding a plea of making a false statement to federal investigators. According to Corsi and the documents he provided, prosecutors offered him a plea deal, which Corsi says he plans to reject because he doesn't believe he knowingly lied.\n\nIn one of the draft court filings shared with CNN on Monday, the special counsel's team outlined how Stone, who is only identified as Person 1, allegedly sought the information and emails from WikiLeaks using at least one person, Corsi, as a go-between. Corsi confirmed to CNN that Stone is Person 1.\n\nMueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the draft documents. The authenticity of all documents could not be confirmed immediately by CNN, though the draft court filings regarding the possible plea agreement match the format, structure and language of all other plea deal cases opened by the Mueller team in DC federal court.\n\nIt is not known how many changes remained to be made to the draft documents. Such information is normally not released until filed in court.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roger Stone associate refuses plea deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roger Stone associate refuses plea deal 02:09\n\nThree alleged lies outlined\n\nIn the draft court papers, prosecutors outline how Corsi allegedly lied three times to the FBI and special counsel's office. He told them he rebuffed Stone when Stone asked him to reach out to WikiLeaks; he denied that Stone asked him to involve another person in the effort; and he denied he shared information about what WikiLeaks had.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Stone allegedly asked Corsi to get in touch with WikiLeaks \"about materials it possessed relevant to the presidential campaign that had not already been released,\" according to the draft filing. \"Get to [Assange],\" Stone wrote on July 25, 2016, three days after Wikileaks dumped thousands of Democratic National Committee emails. According to the documents, Stone directed Corsi to get in touch with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, was blasting publicly the documents stolen in the Russian hack, and \"get the pending [Wikileaks] emails.\"\n\nCorsi then passed that request on to Ted Malloch, a London-based consultant. Malloch said he spoke to the FBI this year and said was asked specifically if he had visited the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He had not, he said. Stone also said he has never met Assange.\n\nMalloch did not respond to a request for comment on this report.\n\nBy August 2, 2016, Corsi was emailing Stone to predict that WikiLeaks had more document dumps in the works. Stone has said he spoke with Trump the following day , August 3.\n\n\"Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I'm back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging,\" Corsi wrote, according to the draft document. \"Time to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke -- neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for Foundation debacle.\"\n\nStone has not been charged publicly, nor have their other contacts or WikiLeaks. But the documents made public Tuesday are the strongest signal yet that Stone could be charged with a crime. Several other contacts of Stone's have testified before a federal grand jury in DC, according to CNN's reporting.\n\nIf Stone were to be charged with a crime for seeking the stolen documents, others who discussed with him reaching WikiLeaks could also face legal risk in a criminal conspiracy case or if they attempted to shield information from Congress, the FBI, prosecutors or the grand jury.\n\n\"Like every politico and political reporter in America I was curious about what (WikiLeaks) had,\" Stone said on Tuesday. But he said his interaction with Corsi, as laid out in the draft filing, \"certainly does not prove that I had advanced notice that anyone had stolen Podesta's emails or that I knew the source or content of the WikiLeaks disclosures.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Mueller investigating meeting between Manafort and Ecuador's president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mueller investigating meeting between Manafort and Ecuador's president 03:02\n\nStone confirms emails\n\nAside from Corsi, the draft documents don't identify the players by name. Stone is referred to as \"Person 1\" by the prosecutors. CNN determined it was Stone through interviews and correspondence matching the emails described in the filings. CNN determined the \"overseas individual\" was Malloch based on previously released correspondence between Corsi, Stone and Malloch. Prior government statements as well as CNN's reporting, context clues and correspondence between Stone and Corsi indicate that \"Organization 1\" in the filings is WikiLeaks.\n\nStone has confirmed the accuracy of the emails between him and Corsi that are revealed in the draft filings. He has also confirmed that Malloch was the individual in London with whom Corsi spoke.\n\nTwelve Russian military intelligence members were charged by Mueller in July for hacking the DNC. None have appeared in US to enter a plea. At that time, Mueller outlined a portion of communications the alleged hackers had with Stone and Wikileaks under the guise of their hacker identity Guccifer 2.0.\n\nThe information in that filing was the last known discussion from the Justice Department of the hackers' contacts with Americans -- and it stopped far short of describing how Americans may have discussed approaching the hackers' spoils behind the scenes.\n\nThe filings made public Tuesday make no claim that Stone or other Americans knew the hackers were affiliated with the Russian government.\n\nAll of the communications between Stone and Corsi, as described in the draft court filing, would have taken place after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced in June 2016 that his organization had materials about Clinton and would be releasing documents before the election.\n\nBy March 2017 -- after US intelligence agencies had pinned the blame on Russia for hacking the Democrats and using WikiLeaks to disseminate stolen material -- Corsi had deleted all of his emails prior to October 11, 2016, prosecutors allege in the draft filing.\n\nAs part of his proposed plea agreement, Corsi would have admitted to only one criminal charge with two components -- lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.\n\nCorsi's lawyer, David Gray, in a letter to prosecutors, said the radio host feared losing his securities license if he pleaded guilty to a criminal charge under seal and did not reveal it to regulators. Gray also said that Corsi would not be sentenced for \"some time.\"\n\nIn the draft agreement, the special counsel's office does not seek for Corsi to cooperate extensively like it has with other defendants. However, prosecutors had made a deal with him two months earlier that he would speak with Mueller's office and testify before the grand jury -- and not lie during either situation.\n\nSo far, Mueller has spoken to dozens of witnesses, including campaign and administration officials, in a similar way to Corsi in September. The special counsel's office has charged four people with lying to investigators. Two, the former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and the Dutch lawyer Alex Van Der Zwaan, were sentenced to prison. Former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn have pleaded guilty and continue to cooperate with investigators on multiple ongoing investigations.\n\nCorsi's lawyer also outlined how Corsi had not reviewed the emails the special counsel's office had before he did the September interview in which he allegedly lied. \"The issue is that the statements that Dr. Corsi made were, in fact, the best he could recall at the time,\" Gray, his attorney, wrote on November 21 to special counsel's office prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky. Corsi amended his statements to the prosecutors and provided them with access to his computers and phones, Gray wrote, but prosecutors still sought to charge him with lying.\n\nGray and another attorney at his law firm have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nReference to Trump annoys President's lawyers\n\nCorsi's statement of offense included a reference to Trump that irritated the Trump legal team so much it caused a delay in returning written answers to questions from the Mueller team.\n\nA source briefed on the matter says Trump's legal team learned of the reference in the Corsi documents in the week before Thanksgiving. Read in context, it's clear that the reference doesn't accuse the President of any wrongdoing. But the Trump lawyers thought naming the President was gratuitous because others weren't identified in the documents, and they complained to the Mueller team. The Corsi documents also came on the heels of a Justice Department court filing made in error that for the first time revealed federal criminal charges apparently filed under seal against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nThe Trump team held off filing the President's response to Mueller for a few days.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the episode."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ukraine leader warns of threat of full-scale confrontation with Russia", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/KLYsKqaFFpY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko warned that his country's simmering conflict with Russia could quickly spiral into full-scale confrontation following a maritime clash between the two countries over the weekend.\n\nThe incident between the Kiev and Moscow ended with three Ukrainian ships in Russian custody.

Video of the incident released by Ukrainian officials appeared to show a Russian ship ramming the Ukrainian tugboat. The incident provoked fury in Kiev, while Russia accused Ukraine of acting as the aggressor and called the incident a \"dangerous provocation\" by Kiev. The Kerch Strait -- a shallow, narrow stretch of water just two to three miles wide at one point -- connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea. It's also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait was opened in May.

In fact, only those of 57 countries (representing 60% of global emissions) are projected to peak by 2030.\n\nThe authors of the report conclude that nations must be more ambitious in their projected emission cuts, increasing them by three times in order to meet the 2 degrees goal and by five times to meet the 1.5 degrees goal by 2030.\n\nKnowing that level of action is extremely unlikely, the 2018 Emissions Gap Report points to the growing potential of \"non-state actors\" to help reach global emissions goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is killing people now, and it's getting much deadlier\n\nThese include smaller governing bodies such as city, state and regional governments, as well as private entities such as companies, investors and civil organizations.\n\nIn addition to simply reducing their own carbon emissions, these entities \"build confidence in governments concerning climate policy and push for more ambitious national goals,\" according to the report.\n\nAnother potential gap-filling tool the report highlights is fiscal policy reform, including fossil fuel taxes and subsidies to low-emission alternatives, which can create strong incentives for low-carbon investments and reduce emissions.\n\nThe report will be a key talking point as key environmental figures convene in Poland next week as part of COP24, where the stated goal is to adopt a plan to execute the Paris Agreement, affecting climate and energy policy for the coming years."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "US professor investigated for role in alleged genetic editing of babies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/f-TsURTYXAM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Rice University is investigating bioengineering professor Michael Deem after he was quoted in media reports as having been involved with the work of He Jiankui, the Chinese researcher who claims to have created the world's first gene-edited babies.\n\nDeem was He's adviser at Rice for 3\u00bd years and published three papers with He.\n\n\"This research raises troubling scientific, legal and ethical questions,\" said Doug Miller, director of Rice University's media relations team.

It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith wins Mississippi US Senate runoff amid racial controversies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/f6q7sqI2yoQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith will win Mississippi's US Senate runoff election, CNN projects, in a contest that centered on her actions and comments evoking the state's dark history of racism and slavery.\n\nHyde-Smith will defeat Democratic challenger Mike Espy, a former congressman and agriculture secretary, in the last Senate race to be decided in 2018. The victory will make her the first woman ever elected to Congress from Mississippi.\n\nHer win on Tuesday means Republicans will hold 53 seats to Democrats' 47 seats in the Senate in January. The GOP grew its majority in the Senate by two seats in this year's midterm elections even as Democrats took control of the House.\n\nHyde-Smith's victory also means that there will be 24 women in the Senate next year. That will set a new record for women serving in the Senate, one more than the current high, set during this Congress.\n\nHyde-Smith will finish out the final two years of former Sen. Thad Cochran's term, who retired earlier this year due to health concerns. Hyde-Smith will have to run again in 2020 to serve a full six-year term.\n\nPresident Donald Trump visited Mississippi on Monday to rally Republican voters behind Hyde-Smith after her comments about a \"public hanging\" set off weeks of controversy.\n\nIt began when video emerged online of her telling supporters earlier this month that she'd be \"on the front row\" if one of her supporters \"invited me to a public hanging.\" She later called the comments an \"exaggerated expression of regard,\" but her use of the phrase brought memories of Mississippi's history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope.\n\nAsked about her remark in a debate, Hyde-Smith said she would \"certainly apologize\" to anyone who was offended, but then pivoted to an attack on her opponent.\n\n\"This comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\" Hyde-Smith said.\n\nHyde-Smith's comments prompted deeper dives into her history.\n\nThe same progressive blogger who published the video of her using the phrase \"public hanging\" later published one in which Hyde-Smith told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \"a great thing.\" Her campaign said it was a joke, but that explanation backfired when the black student seen laughing in a picture from the event her campaign posted on Twitter responded that Hyde-Smith's campaign was using him as a prop.\n\nOn Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith had attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate public schools. Hyde-Smith's daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. The senator's campaign responded to the report by attacking the \"liberal media.\"\n\nOver the weekend, CNN reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier's effort to \"defend his homeland\" and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War.\n\nIn photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The caption on the post read, \"Mississippi history at its best!\"\n\nDemocrats had hoped a surge in turnout among black voters -- who make up nearly 40% of Mississippi's population, the largest share in the nation -- could carry Espy to victory in a state that is highly polarized along racial lines, with most white voters backing GOP candidates and black voters supporting Democrats.\n\nEspy's campaign hammered Hyde-Smith with television ads that cast her as an embarrassment to a state that has attempted to overcome its history of slavery and racism.\n\n\"We've worked hard to overcome the stereotypes that hurt our economy and cost us jobs. Her words should not reflect Mississippi's values, either,\" a narrator said in one ad. The ad also called Hyde-Smith \"so embarrassing, she'd be a disaster for Mississippi.\"\n\nSeveral companies that had donated to Hyde-Smith's campaign, including Walmart, publicly withdrew their support for the senator over the \"public hanging\" comment.\n\nThe controversies surrounding her set off a major push by national Republicans to avoid the same embarrassment they'd suffered last year in Alabama over the Senate campaign of Roy Moore and save Hyde-Smith.\n\nWhile Hyde-Smith largely stayed off the campaign trail, the party's infrastructure rallied to her defense. GOP groups spent $4 million on the Mississippi runoff -- much more than Democrats' $1.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Republican groups spent more than twice as much as Democrats on television advertisements, per the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.\n\nTrump's visits to Mississippi on Monday night were also seen as bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/HcUiRFagT2U/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has denied ever meeting Julian Assange, following a report he had met with the WikiLeaks founder at least three times in previous years.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Guardian reported that Manafort had secretly met several times with Assange inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, including around the time he was made a top figure in the Trump campaign.

In a court filing on Monday, Mueller accused Manafort of lying to investigators after agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel's office.\n\nCiting a \"well-placed source,\" The Guardian reported that Manafort had met with Assange around March 2016, just months before WikiLeaks released Democratic emails believed to be stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\n\nManfort's lawyers declined to answer the Guardian's questions about the visits.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that an internal document written by Ecuador's intelligence agency and seen by The Guardian contains Manafort's name on a list of \"well-known\" guests at the embassy in 2013.

According to Corsi and the documents he provided, prosecutors offered him a plea deal, which Corsi says he plans to reject because he doesn't believe he knowingly lied.\n\nIn one of the draft court filings shared with CNN on Monday, the special counsel's team outlined how Stone, who is only identified as Person 1, allegedly sought the information and emails from WikiLeaks using at least one person, Corsi, as a go-between. Corsi confirmed to CNN that Stone is Person 1.\n\nMueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the draft documents. The authenticity of all documents could not be confirmed immediately by CNN, though the draft court filings regarding the possible plea agreement match the format, structure and language of all other plea deal cases opened by the Mueller team in DC federal court.\n\nIt is not known how many changes remained to be made to the draft documents. Such information is normally not released until filed in court.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roger Stone associate refuses plea deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roger Stone associate refuses plea deal 02:09\n\nThree alleged lies outlined\n\nIn the draft court papers, prosecutors outline how Corsi allegedly lied three times to the FBI and special counsel's office. He told them he rebuffed Stone when Stone asked him to reach out to WikiLeaks; he denied that Stone asked him to involve another person in the effort; and he denied he shared information about what WikiLeaks had.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Stone allegedly asked Corsi to get in touch with WikiLeaks \"about materials it possessed relevant to the presidential campaign that had not already been released,\" according to the draft filing. \"Get to [Assange],\" Stone wrote on July 25, 2016, three days after Wikileaks dumped thousands of Democratic National Committee emails. According to the documents, Stone directed Corsi to get in touch with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, was blasting publicly the documents stolen in the Russian hack, and \"get the pending [Wikileaks] emails.\"\n\nCorsi then passed that request on to Ted Malloch, a London-based consultant. Malloch said he spoke to the FBI this year and said was asked specifically if he had visited the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He had not, he said. Stone also said he has never met Assange.\n\nMalloch did not respond to a request for comment on this report.\n\nBy August 2, 2016, Corsi was emailing Stone to predict that WikiLeaks had more document dumps in the works. Stone has said he spoke with Trump the following day , August 3.\n\n\"Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I'm back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging,\" Corsi wrote, according to the draft document. \"Time to let more than [the Clinton Campaign chairman] to be exposed as in bed w enemy if they are not ready to drop HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton]. That appears to be the game hackers are now about. Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke -- neither he nor she well. I expect that much of next dump focus, setting stage for Foundation debacle.\"\n\nStone has not been charged publicly, nor have their other contacts or WikiLeaks. But the documents made public Tuesday are the strongest signal yet that Stone could be charged with a crime. Several other contacts of Stone's have testified before a federal grand jury in DC, according to CNN's reporting.\n\nIf Stone were to be charged with a crime for seeking the stolen documents, others who discussed with him reaching WikiLeaks could also face legal risk in a criminal conspiracy case or if they attempted to shield information from Congress, the FBI, prosecutors or the grand jury.\n\n\"Like every politico and political reporter in America I was curious about what (WikiLeaks) had,\" Stone said on Tuesday. But he said his interaction with Corsi, as laid out in the draft filing, \"certainly does not prove that I had advanced notice that anyone had stolen Podesta's emails or that I knew the source or content of the WikiLeaks disclosures.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Mueller investigating meeting between Manafort and Ecuador's president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mueller investigating meeting between Manafort and Ecuador's president 03:02\n\nStone confirms emails\n\nAside from Corsi, the draft documents don't identify the players by name. Stone is referred to as \"Person 1\" by the prosecutors. CNN determined it was Stone through interviews and correspondence matching the emails described in the filings. CNN determined the \"overseas individual\" was Malloch based on previously released correspondence between Corsi, Stone and Malloch. Prior government statements as well as CNN's reporting, context clues and correspondence between Stone and Corsi indicate that \"Organization 1\" in the filings is WikiLeaks.\n\nStone has confirmed the accuracy of the emails between him and Corsi that are revealed in the draft filings. He has also confirmed that Malloch was the individual in London with whom Corsi spoke.\n\nTwelve Russian military intelligence members were charged by Mueller in July for hacking the DNC. None have appeared in US to enter a plea. At that time, Mueller outlined a portion of communications the alleged hackers had with Stone and Wikileaks under the guise of their hacker identity Guccifer 2.0.\n\nThe information in that filing was the last known discussion from the Justice Department of the hackers' contacts with Americans -- and it stopped far short of describing how Americans may have discussed approaching the hackers' spoils behind the scenes.\n\nThe filings made public Tuesday make no claim that Stone or other Americans knew the hackers were affiliated with the Russian government.\n\nAll of the communications between Stone and Corsi, as described in the draft court filing, would have taken place after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange announced in June 2016 that his organization had materials about Clinton and would be releasing documents before the election.\n\nBy March 2017 -- after US intelligence agencies had pinned the blame on Russia for hacking the Democrats and using WikiLeaks to disseminate stolen material -- Corsi had deleted all of his emails prior to October 11, 2016, prosecutors allege in the draft filing.\n\nAs part of his proposed plea agreement, Corsi would have admitted to only one criminal charge with two components -- lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.\n\nCorsi's lawyer, David Gray, in a letter to prosecutors, said the radio host feared losing his securities license if he pleaded guilty to a criminal charge under seal and did not reveal it to regulators. Gray also said that Corsi would not be sentenced for \"some time.\"\n\nIn the draft agreement, the special counsel's office does not seek for Corsi to cooperate extensively like it has with other defendants. However, prosecutors had made a deal with him two months earlier that he would speak with Mueller's office and testify before the grand jury -- and not lie during either situation.\n\nSo far, Mueller has spoken to dozens of witnesses, including campaign and administration officials, in a similar way to Corsi in September. The special counsel's office has charged four people with lying to investigators. Two, the former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and the Dutch lawyer Alex Van Der Zwaan, were sentenced to prison. Former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn have pleaded guilty and continue to cooperate with investigators on multiple ongoing investigations.\n\nCorsi's lawyer also outlined how Corsi had not reviewed the emails the special counsel's office had before he did the September interview in which he allegedly lied. \"The issue is that the statements that Dr. Corsi made were, in fact, the best he could recall at the time,\" Gray, his attorney, wrote on November 21 to special counsel's office prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky. Corsi amended his statements to the prosecutors and provided them with access to his computers and phones, Gray wrote, but prosecutors still sought to charge him with lying.\n\nGray and another attorney at his law firm have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nReference to Trump annoys President's lawyers\n\nCorsi's statement of offense included a reference to Trump that irritated the Trump legal team so much it caused a delay in returning written answers to questions from the Mueller team.\n\nA source briefed on the matter says Trump's legal team learned of the reference in the Corsi documents in the week before Thanksgiving. Read in context, it's clear that the reference doesn't accuse the President of any wrongdoing. But the Trump lawyers thought naming the President was gratuitous because others weren't identified in the documents, and they complained to the Mueller team. The Corsi documents also came on the heels of a Justice Department court filing made in error that for the first time revealed federal criminal charges apparently filed under seal against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nThe Trump team held off filing the President's response to Mueller for a few days.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the episode."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Nadler warns Trump 'dangling a pardon' for Manafort is 'close to obstruction of justice'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/5b7qSshlny0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The likely incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee warned President Donald Trump that \"even dangling a pardon\" for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort \"would fortify a claim or a charge of obstruction of justice.\"\n\n\"I suspect they're dangling a pardon in front of Manafort,\" Rep.

Deem also says a research interest is the \"mathematical model of evolution that accounts for cross-species genetic exchange.\"\n\nMatthews wrote in an email that she \"was surprised yesterday, like many others, to find out that Professor Deem was involved in this research.\" Adding that she had only recently began working with Deem, she said she had not \"seen anything to suggest that Professor Deem's scientific work is in question,\" nor did she believe any data in co-authored paper was affected.\n\n\"Had Professor Deem informed me of his work using CRISPR on human embryos to develop a baby, I would have recommended extreme caution using this technology on human embryos and to wait for more data on risks before using manipulated embryos for pregnancies,\" Matthews wrote.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe, who the university says was \"the son of rice farmers in Hunan Province in China,\" was lead author with Deem on a paper presenting a mathematical model that could determine within two weeks whether a new strain of the influenza virus should be included in the annual seasonal flu vaccine.

In his YouTube video, He describes the procedure as having \"removed the doorway through which HIV enters.\"\n\nHe's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties, including the United States. In the UK, editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or, if used in pregnancy, whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.\n\nChina has invested heavily in gene-editing technology, with the government bankrolling research into a number of world \"firsts,\" including the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans in 2016 and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos in 2015.\n\nMore recently researchers in China claimed to have bred healthy mice from same-sex parents, using gene editing technology.\n\nBut in a statement posted Tuesday morning, China's National Health Commission said that it had \"immediately requested the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission to seriously investigate and verify\" the claims made by He Jiankui.\n\nThe statement follows moves by the Chinese hospital named in He's ethical approval documents, Shenzhen Harmonicare Women's and Children's Hospital, to distance itself from involvement in the procedures.\n\n\"We can ensure that the research wasn't conducted in our hospital nor were the babies born here,\" a hospital representative told CNN. The hospital confirmed that two of the doctors named in He's documents work at the hospital and suggested that an internal investigation was underway.\n\nAn initial investigation by the hospital said that signatures on He's ethics review form are suspected to be forged. The hospital has never convened an ethics committee meeting on it, according to a statement on its WeChat account , and the facility will ask police to intervene and investigate it and hold related people accountable by law.\n\nThe Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Commission denounced the legitimacy of the hospital ethics committee and the review process that approved the application. It confirmed that an investigation was launched Monday to \"verify the authenticity of the ethical review of the research reported by media.\"\n\nHe's University, Southern University of Science and Technology, said in a statement that the researcher has been on leave since February 1.\n\n\"The research work was carried out outside the school by Associate Professor He Jiankui. He did not report to the school or the department of biology. The university and the biology department are not aware of it,\" the institution said, adding that \"the Academic Committee of the Department of Biology believes that it seriously violates academic ethics and academic norms.\"\n\nA 'huge blow' to Chinese research\n\nA joint statement issued by more than 120 Chinese scientists on the Chinese social media site Weibo condemns the human genome-editing research.\n\n\"The medical ethics review exists in the name only. Directly experimenting on human is nothing but crazy ... as soon as a living human is produced, no one could predict what kind of impact it will bring, as the modified inheritable substance will inevitably blend into human genome pool,\" they wrote, adding that the trial is a \"huge blow\" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. \"It's extremely unfair to Chinese scientist who are diligent, innovative and defending the bottom line of scientific ethics.\"\n\nJulian Savulescu, director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, described the alleged births as \"genetic Russian Roulette.\"\n\n\"If true, this experiment is monstrous,\" he said. \"The embryos were healthy. No known diseases. Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.\n\n\"There are many effective ways to prevent HIV in healthy individuals: For example, protected sex. And there are effective treatments if one does contract it,\" Savulescu said.\n\nJoyce Harper, a professor in genetics and human embryology at the Institute for Women's Health at University College London, described the alleged research \"premature, dangerous and irresponsible,\" calling for public debate and legislation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Before this procedure comes anywhere near clinical practice, we need years of work to show that meddling with the genome of the embryo is not going to cause harm to the future person,\" she said in a statement.\n\nDespite ethical concerns in the West, a recent study suggested that the Chinese public is broadly in favor of using gene-editing for medical purposes. An online survey conducted by Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou found that more than two-thirds of the 4,771 people surveyed (575 of whom reportedly have HIV), supported its use in treating diseases, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times.\n\n\"(Chinese people) have a high willingness to use of gene in disease prevention and treatment,\" Liang Chen, a professor at Sun Yat-Sen University was quoted as saying. \"This suggests that the research of gene editing in China not only has a promising potential, but also is responding to the public's needs.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Sky-high prices for air ambulances hurt those they are helping", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/D6l9M0h6PaQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sonna Anderson was enjoying a horseback ride through the Badlands in North Dakota in September 2017 when her horse, Cody, got spooked, jerked toward a fence and tripped on a cow track in the dirt. The horse rolled onto Anderson, who hit her head, briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs.\n\nThe 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance, a helicopter with a medical crew, also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away.\n\n\"But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost, but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance,\" Anderson said. \"But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted.\"\n\nFor that one helicopter ride, to a hospital farther away in Bismarck, records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54,727.26. Sanford Health Plan, her insurance, paid $13,697.73. That left Anderson with a $41,029.53 bill.\n\nValley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"It shocked me,\" Anderson said. \"I kept thinking, 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me, when really, it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous.\"\n\nShared outrage\n\nabout air ambulance bills have Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson, and complaintsabout air ambulance bills have \"increased rapidly,\" according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance.\n\nCharges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34,000 to more than $533,000.\n\nflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state 2017 federal investigation found that costs for an average air ambulanceflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state investigation found.\n\nEach state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases, CNN could see details about the patient's condition, how far and where they were flown, how much they were charged, how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However, it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.\n\nOne complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547,725.\n\nIt cost another family $62,749.35 to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist.\n\nBut these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven, Florida, to one in Orlando for tests, which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31,253.33 bill.\n\nJUST WATCHED $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later 02:02\n\nEmergency personnel requested another hospital-to-hospital transfer in Arkansas for an X-ray. It cost $37,850, according to a letter to the state insurance department.\n\n\"We carry insurance to avoid the catastrophic situations,\" wrote the man, whose name was redacted. \"I don't see where the consumer is getting a fair shake in this deal.\"\n\nThe desire may be there for change, but nothing's worked.\n\nThe price of these flights is not regulated by Obamacare. Instead, they fall under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act , which removed a state's ability to control airfares and routes long before air ambulances were common. October's Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act created a committee to address the problem, but it failed to design a definitive solution, experts say.\n\nAir ambulances take off\n\nAir ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives, but some question whether their value remains.\n\nIn 1966, civilian deaths from accidental injuries were \"a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars,\" the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time.\n\nAir ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then, but when researchers discovered that soldiers wounded in the Vietnam War had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents, the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful, and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.\n\nThe golden hour\n\nA 'cash cow'\n\nthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately, new companies entered the market. Private equity firms, not hospitals, now ownthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion in 2010 and sold it five years later for $2 billion\n\nAs private companies got into the market, prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014, the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30,000 a ride, according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office investigation\n\n\"They have a cash cow on their hands,\" New Mexico state Rep. Liz Thomson said.\n\nThomson said a state analysis also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network, insurance will cover little or nothing at all.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services says more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not, Thomson said, and that can be a serious issue.\n\n\"If they aren't in a network, they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay,\" said Susan Rider, an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis. \"They don't have to participate, so they don't, and then essentially, they can charge what they want.\"\n\nIn 2017, Thomson introduced a bill to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for \"balance bills,\" meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature, but she hopes to introduce it again.\n\nThe air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill, but it was not alone.\n\n\"I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection, so I had a running joke that while I don't drink, I would drink a bottle of champagne if the [insurance?] industry ever stood up for any of my bills,\" Thomson said. \"Sure enough, I needed to buy a bottle, because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill, all these insurance people stood up and said, 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous.\"\n\nMike Castleberry , senior vice president of network services and business development for HealthSCOPE Benefits , a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans, said the costs for these services don't add up. \"When you really get into the math, it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses,\" he said.\n\n\"We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for a pilot,\" Castleberry said. \"Add up all those factors, even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that, that's still not even half what they are charging me, which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills, I know it shouldn't cost this much.\"\n\nHe also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees, who are told to take these flights, aren't trauma cases. \"They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care,\" Castleberry said. \"Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other.\"\n\nCastleberry, who has clients across the country, said private operators aren't the only ones making money. \"County governments and city hospitals [which can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs,\" he said.\n\nThe actual costs\n\nThe air medical transport industry argues that although single flights \"may appear to be expensive,\" they are \"very cost-effective\" compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.\n\nStaffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year, said Chris Eastlee , vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nSome in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002, based on an estimated 1998 cost pool, increasing reimbursement for inflation only. \"It was never based on real cost collection,\" said Rick Sherlock , the association's ex-officio president and CEO.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay, like patients with Medicare. This payment is significantly less than the cost of the transportation, Sherlock said.\n\n\"Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar, and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service,\" Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed, he said.\n\nIf the government reimburses the industry more, Sherlock said, \"you eliminate the need to balance bill.\"\n\nThe insured pay the costs\n\nAnderson, who was billed $54,727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands, got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all.\n\n\"This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"In other words, I may not have had $54,000 worth of treatment, but essentially, they have to make up their costs somehow,\" Anderson said. \"It's not fair at all.\"\n\n\"Some of these bills are pretty egregious, and these are consumers who have done everything right,\" Godfread said. \"They have health insurance, they ask questions ahead of time, and often, they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly, but consumers are the ones left paying the bills, and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves.\"\n\nAndrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41,063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital.\n\nJacob Courier's air ambulance hospital transfer cost $41,063.78.\n\n\"First, I could have driven to that other hospital faster,\" Courier said. \"We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise, but we still faced this huge bill.\"\n\nHis insurance company picked up $8,960.49 of the bill, that meant he would be left paying $32,103.29 out-of-pocket.\n\n\"We work hard, we pay our bills on time, and this is how we are repaid,\" Courier said. \"It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college, not for a short helicopter ride.\"\n\nCourier made multiple phone calls to the company, a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents balance billing , which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually, the cost of the flight was forgiven.\n\n\"I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company, but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me,\" Courier said, but he's still upset.\n\nMed Trans Air Medical Transport, which ran the air ambulance that day, referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nStates try to help\n\nOther state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do, beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices encourage patients to call with complaints.\n\nThough states like Mississippi have balance billing protection, that tactic has had limited success elsewhere, as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal, not state, jurisdiction.\n\nNorth Dakota tried another approach. Its 2015 law required providers to disclose prices before the flight, upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety, in which case they would be exempt. The courts overturned that legislation, ruling that it was a federal matter.\n\nNorth Dakota's 2017 legislation requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. \"We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate,\" Godfread said. \"It will, however, likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can \"help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle,\" Eastlee said. \"Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together.\"\n\nThe Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\" Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March, its new law will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an \"emergency medical condition\" that they have a choice between air and ground transportation.The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\"\n\nCongress and the law\n\nIt will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act , passed in October, created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints, and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position.\n\n\"It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry,\" said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill. \"By creating an aviation consumer advocate, much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS, my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations.\"\n\nThe industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it \"enhanced consumer protection\" and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability, Eastlee said, \"but we also have to work to sustain the service.\"\n\nSherlock added, \"the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's balance bill .\"\n\nFor Anderson, Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41,029.53 out of pocket, she offered to settle for $4,100, on top of the $13,000 her insurance paid.\n\n\"I thought, I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable,\" Anderson said. For three months, she heard nothing from the company, so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month, the company offered to negotiate, documents show, but eventually, it accepted her offer.\n\nAnderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody, her horse, is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him, as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"For a little more than 45 minutes of service, they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair,\" Anderson said. \"I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills, I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner, but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable. No one should feel shocked or panicked by a bill like this.

He was not involved in the new report.\n\n\"What is happening is that these studies use methods that are a bit more liberal and inclusive than the CDC's methods,\" Frazier said, adding that he prefers the CDC's numbers but understands \"that they are likely a bit conservative.\"\n\nThe new study is based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, which was conducted by the US Census Bureau and which collected information from parents of more than 50,000 children up to age 17. To be included in the estimate, parents would have had to report that their child had ever received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and that they currently had the condition.\n\nThe new numbers were also slightly lower than those in the 2017 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated that 2.76% of children had ever received such a diagnosis, which the authors of the new report note is a broader definition.\n\nThe fact that the new study relies on parental reporting -- which is not validated by health and education records, as in the CDC report -- may be a limitation despite the broad scope of the research, the authors say.\n\nFrazier said the 1-in-40 figure is \"generally consistent with previous parent surveys and other direct prevalence studies where researchers directly screen for and attempt to identify autism.\"\n\nThe parents in the new study also reported more difficulties getting the health care their children need, versus those with Down syndrome, or other behavioral disorder, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\"Though we've seen progress in recent years, this confirms what we know from our parents -- that many children face unacceptable delays in getting a diagnostic evaluation, even after parents, teachers or other caregivers have recognized the signs of autism,\" Frazier said.\n\nIn the new study, more than a quarter of children with autism spectrum disorder were taking medication for symptoms related to the condition, and nearly two-thirds have received \"behavioral treatments\" in the past year, the study says.\n\nIt also found a higher prevalence for autism spectrum disorder among certain groups such as boys, children of single mothers and households below the federal poverty level, compared with those at least four times above that income threshold.\n\nThe differences between the new study's numbers and those of the CDC study might be explained by the years they were conducted, the ages of children studied and where they lived, according to the new study.\n\nThe CDC report was based on data collected from 11 communities across the country but was not necessarily nationally representative, according to that report's co-author Daisy Christensen, surveillance team lead in the developmental disabilities branch of the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\"Parents know their child best,\" Christensen, who was not involved in the new report, previously told CNN . \"We want to encourage parents to be aware of their child's development, to be aware of the milestones that children achieve.\"\n\nAutism spectrum disorder, a lifelong developmental disability, is characterized by problems with communication and social interaction with accompanying repetitive behavior patterns.\n\nThe authors note that it's difficult to compare the new report with prior iterations due to updates in how the survey collected its data and how questions were worded.\n\n\"We cannot tell what proportion was explained by internal survey changes rather than external factors,\" the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the report comes as estimated prevalences of the disorder have been rising for decades.\n\n\"Over the '80s and '90s, the diagnostic criteria expanded to include more children,\" Christensen said, \"so I think that's definitely a possibility for the increase that we've seen.\"\n\nIn the past, more than half of children identified with autism also had intellectual disability, and now it's about a third, she said. \"And that's really consistent with identifying children who are perhaps at the milder end of the spectrum.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe new study's authors also note that universal screening recommendations in the 2000s may have led to a rise in prevalence among younger children, for example.\n\n\"Because there is no biological marker, [autism spectrum disorder] is a particularly challenging condition to track,\" the authors note.\n\nBut understanding how common it is allows health experts to distribute resources and get families the help they need, according to Frazier.\n\n\"Having prevalence estimates -- even if there is some variation -- helps us to advocate for improved screening, diagnosis, interventions and supports,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc",

benefits of remaining in the EU with the political benefits of leaving the EU.\n\n\"What the prime minister's deal does is absolutely minimises those costs, and reduces to an absolute minimum the economic impact of leaving the EU, while delivering the political benefits, in terms of being able to do third-country trade deals, having control of our fishing waters, and the many other issues that will be delivered politically,\" he told the Today programme.\n\nMeanwhile, the PM will visit Scotland and argue she was \"robust\" in defending UK fishing in her Brexit talks.\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the Treasury analysis will show that under Mrs May's deal, the UK's GDP will be between 1% and 2% lower over 15 years than if it stayed in the EU, compared with 7.5% lower under a no deal situation.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said it does not comment on leaks.\n\nThe Telegraph also quotes the former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab saying the Treasury's analysis \"looks like a rehash of Project Fear\".\n\nIn other developments, the Commons Public Accounts Committee issued a report warning of a \"real prospect\" of \"major disruption\" at UK ports in the case of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Foster: This is not the right deal for Northern Ireland\n\nMPs are due to vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal, which she insists is the only option, on 11 December.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the prime minister is visiting different parts of the UK to engage directly with the public and businesses in a bid to build support for the deal.\n\nShe insisted it protected the \"vital interests\" of the whole of the UK when visiting Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday, while denying claims from DUP leader Arlene Foster that she had \"given up\" on negotiations before agreeing the Brexit deal.\n\nDuring a visit near Glasgow, Mrs May will speak to factory workers about how she believes her deal provides an \"unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has\" and certainty for employers and their staff.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\n\"We will be free to strike our own trade deals around the world, providing even greater opportunity to Scottish exporters,\" she will say.\n\nShe will also say that moving away from the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP) \"which has so tragically failed Scotland's coastal communities\" will leave the UK \"free to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in our waters\".\n\nThe UK sells nearly \u00a31bn of fish produce to the EU every year, and a number of EU countries are insisting that tariff-free trade of that kind can continue only if EU fishing boats continue to get access to UK waters.\n\nThe SNP claims the industry will be \"sold out\".\n\nThe party says access to UK waters for EU boats will be used as a \"bargaining chip\" to secure a good post-Brexit trade deal.\n\nScottish Conservative Ross Thomson, has already voiced concerns the draft deal

with the leadership of Labour, the Lib Dems and Democratic Unionists have all said they will reject Mrs May's deal.\n\nMany Tories have also said publicly they are opposed to Mrs May's deal.\n\nMeanwhile, a row is brewing after the Labour party demanded the government publish its full legal advice on the Brexit deal this week.\n\nThe government has only said it will publish a \"full reasoned position statement\" laying its out political and legal position on the withdrawal agreement.\n\nBBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said a source says the full advice provides a \"very stark warning\" that there is no way the UK, on its own, would be able to get out of the so-called Northern Ireland backstop.\n\nThe backstop - the plan to create a temporary single customs territory to prevent the return of customs posts at the Irish border in the event no EU-UK trade deal comes into force - is controversial because Brexiteers fear it would keep the UK tied to EU rules

Ukraine has two big ports on the northern shore of the Azov sea, and a 2003 treaty allows both countries free access to its waters.\n\nWhat other reaction has there been?\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the seizure of Ukrainian ships is a \"dangerous escalation and a violation of international law\".\n\nThe UK condemned Russia's \"destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty\".\n\nTaking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had \"deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation\", the Kremlin said.\n\nMrs Merkel had \"stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue,\" her spokesman said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Queensland bushfires: Thousands told to flee 'catastrophic' threat", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46366964", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPA Image caption More than 130 bushfires are burning across Queensland, officials say\n\nThousands of Australians have been told to evacuate their homes as a powerful bushfire threatens properties in Queensland.\n\nIt follows the raising of the state's fire danger warning to \"catastrophic\" - the highest level - for the first time.\n\nMore than 130 bushfires are burning across Queensland, fuelled by strong winds, a heatwave and dry vegetation.\n\nThe worst threat is for a fast-moving bushfire near the town of Gracemere, said Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.\n\n\"We have never, ever in this state been in this situation before,\" she told reporters late on Wednesday.\n\n\"We have not had a catastrophic level.

He undoubtedly helped to motivate his supporters with appearances in Mississippi at eve-of-election rallies.\n\nYet Democrats and their candidate Mike Espy may well claim some sort of moral victory. In a state widely regarded as a Republican stronghold they made this run-off election a genuine battle.\n\nIn his statement admitting defeat, Mr Espy pointedly wrote that Mississippi's future would be brighter than its past.\n\nAccording to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings in the nation from 1882 to 1968.\n\nMr Espy condemned his rival's comment as \"reprehensible\"; Ms Hyde-Smith maintained there was no \"negative connotation\".\n\nThe Democrat has himself come under scrutiny for his 2011 lobbying work in the Ivory Coast, whose former despot Laurent Gbagbo is on trial at the International Criminal Court.\n\nMr Espy was agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton, but resigned under a cloud of corruption allegations, on which he was later acquitted.\n\nImage copyright Reuters/Getty Images Image caption Democratic challenger Mike Espy criticised incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith over

recording showed the senator saying there were some liberals \"who maybe we don't want to vote - maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult [to vote]\".\n\nHer campaign later said the comment was a joke and the video had been \"selectively altered\", the Washington Post reported.\n\nAt a recent debate, Ms Hyde-Smith gave a qualified apology to anyone she had offended, while adding that opponents had \"twisted\" her words \"as a political weapon\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump travelled to Mississippi on the eve of the vote to campaign for Ms Hyde-Smith.\n\n\"I know her, and I know she apologised, and she misspoke,\" the Republican president told reporters on his way to the state.\n\nHe painted Mr Espy as a far-left ideologue who would \"rather protect illegal aliens than people

England has announced plans to curb the prescription of \"low-priority\" items like silk garments.\n\nThere is limited evidence the clothing helps people with eczema and dermatitis enough to justify prescribing it, a consultation document says.\n\nOfficials are proposing taking eight items off the NHS prescription list under plans aimed at saving \u00a368m a year.\n\nOthers include an acne medication and diabetes products.\n\nThe items, which are deemed to be of relatively low clinical effectiveness, to have cheaper options available or to be of \"low priority\" for funding, are:\n\nSilk garments - for eczema and dermatitis\n\nAliskiren - used to treat blood pressure\n\nAmiodarone - to treat abnormal heart rhythms\n\nBath and shower emollient preparations - to treat eczema and dermatitis\n\nDronedarone - to treat the heart condition atrial fibrillation\n\nMinocycline - to treat acne\n\nBlood glucose testing strips - for diabetes\n\nNeedles for pre-filled and reusable insulin pens - for diabetes\n\nMany prescribers will not be surprised by the recommendations and have already started phasing out the items.\n\nThe health service in England spends more than \u00a31.2m a year on prescriptions for silk garments, examples of which include silk baby bodysuits, infant leggings, children's pyjamas, gloves or tubular sleeves.\n\nIn the case of the diabetes testing strips, needles and pens, officials are proposing that GPs prescribe more cost-effective alternatives rather than scrapping them.\n\nNHS England has already ordered an end to the routine prescribing of 18 low-value items, including homeopathy treatments and over-the-counter products such as paracetamol and cough medicines.\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: \"The NHS is one of the most efficient health services in the world but, as part of the long-term plan for the NHS, we're determined to make taxpayers' money go further and drive savings back into front-line care.\n\n\"It is essential the NHS should not be paying for anything which has been proven to be ineffective or where there are safer or cheaper alternatives.\"\n\nThe consultation comes ahead of GPs

other foodstuffs such as pizzas, cakes and biscuits, NHS England said.\n\nOfficials added that the NHS began funding gluten-free food products in the late 1960s, when availability was limited, but now a wide variety of foods is available in supermarkets.\n\nThe consultation will run for three months from 28 November 2018 until 28 February 2019, after which joint commissioning guidance is expected to be published by NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners.\n\nThe National Eczema Society said it was \"vital for people with eczema to have access to the right emollient products on

years under no deal, with Theresa May's plan costing \u00a340bn.\n\nMeanwhile, the PM will visit Scotland and argue she was \"robust\" in defending UK fishing in her Brexit talks.\n\nMr Hammond, who was a committed Remainer during the 2016 referendum, told BBC Breakfast: \"This is the only plan available for a negotiated exit from the EU that will allow us to deliver Brexit in accordance with the referendum decision and protect our economy...\n\n\"It's the best plan available.\"\n\nHe said it was clear if there was no deal, it would \"create impediments to trade\" and lead to higher food prices.\n\n\"If the only consideration was the economy then the analysis shows clearly that remaining in the European Union would be a better outcome for the economy but not by much,\" he said.\n\n\"The prime minister's deal delivers an outcome that is very close to the economic benefits of remaining in, while having all the political benefits of being out.\"\n\nHe said if the deal was not voted through Parliament, Mrs May's cabinet will sit down and \"decide how best to proceed\".\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the Treasury analysis will show that under Mrs May's deal, the UK's GDP will be between 1% and 2% lower over 15 years than if it stayed in the EU, compared with 7.5% lower under a no deal situation.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said it does not comment on

agreement won the support of EU leaders at the weekend.\n\nBut it has faced strong criticism from opposition parties - as well as from many of her own MPs.\n\nThe prime minister's visit comes a day

vote against the deal on 11 December.\n\nThe proposals are also opposed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionists and many Conservative MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate.\n\nIt means Mrs May currently looks unlikely to win parliament's backing for the deal, which she has warned is the only one on the table - and that voting it down would result in the UK leaving the EU on 29 March next year without any deal in place.\n\nAhead of the prime minister's visit to Scotland, the UK government said the deal reached in Brussels on Sunday creates a free trade area for goods with no tariffs, fees or charges - which it says is the first agreement of its kind between an advanced economy and the EU.\n\nIt has also highlighted the support the deal has received in recent days from

of \"low priority\" for funding, are:\n\nSilk garments - for eczema and dermatitis\n\nAliskiren - used to treat blood pressure\n\nAmiodarone - to treat abnormal heart rhythms\n\nBath and shower emollient preparations - to treat eczema and dermatitis\n\nDronedarone - to treat the heart condition atrial fibrillation\n\nMinocycline - to treat acne\n\nBlood glucose testing strips - for diabetes\n\nNeedles for pre-filled and reusable insulin pens - for diabetes\n\nMany prescribers will not be surprised by the recommendations and have already started phasing out the items.\n\nThe health service in England spends more than \u00a31.2m a year on prescriptions for silk garments, examples of which include silk baby bodysuits, infant leggings, children's pyjamas, gloves or tubular sleeves.\n\nIn the case of the diabetes testing strips, needles and pens, officials are proposing that GPs prescribe more cost-effective alternatives rather than scrapping them.\n\nNHS England has already ordered an end to the routine prescribing of 18 low-value items, including homeopathy treatments and over-the-counter products such as paracetamol and cough medicines.\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: \"The NHS is one of the most efficient health services in the world but, as part of the long-term plan for the NHS, we're determined to make taxpayers' money go further and drive savings back into front-line care.\n\n\"It is essential the NHS should not be paying for anything which has been proven to be ineffective or where there are safer or cheaper alternatives.\"\n\nThe consultation comes ahead of GPs being issued with new guidance next week on gluten-free prescriptions.\n\nWhile patients can still receive bread and gluten-free baking mixes under NHS prescriptions, they are no longer eligible for other foodstuffs such as pizzas, cakes and biscuits, NHS England said.\n\nOfficials added that the NHS began funding gluten-free food products in the late 1960s, when availability was limited, but now a wide variety of foods is available in supermarkets.\n\nThe consultation will run for three months from 28 November 2018 until 28 February 2019, after which joint commissioning guidance is expected to be published by NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioners.\n\nThe National Eczema Society said it was \"vital for people with eczema to have access to the right emollient products on prescription\".\n\nA spokesman added: \"We look forward to participating in the consultation.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link":

real fear of loss of life of a loved one or themselves.\n\nExperts warn the longer it goes undiagnosed, the harder it is to treat.\n\nMs Simpson, 34, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, was rushed to an operating theatre with her unborn daughter Macie in the breech position, after two unsuccessful attempts to move the baby in the womb.\n\n\"There were a lot of people around me,\" she said. \"There

the mother losing several pints of blood after haemorrhaging.\n\nMothers have a post-natal appointment about six weeks after the baby's birth to assess recovery and check for post-natal depression, but PTSD is not routinely looked for.\n\nMs Simpson, whose daughter is now 16 months old, said: \"I was going through the birth over and over again, it was exhausting and really painful.\n\n\"It was physically draining, all that on top of having to look after a new baby was really difficult.\"\n\nMonths after the birth, she noticed her emotions were not fading so tried cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) followed by a successful programme of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\nEMDR works on the theory that traumatic memories have not been properly processed by the

argued the current law is an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private life under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe three Supreme Court judges said it was open to them to declare the current law was incompatible with the convention, and leave it to Parliament to decide what to do about it.\n\nBut the judges will have taken into consideration the overwhelming

in many countries the report says\n\nGlobal efforts to tackle climate change are way off track says the UN, as it details the first rise in CO2 emissions in four years.\n\nThe emissions gap report says that economic growth is responsible for a rise in 2017 while national efforts to cut carbon have faltered.\n\nTo meet the goals of the Paris climate pact, the study says it's crucial that global emissions peak by 2020.\n\nBut the analysis says that this is now not likely even by 2030.\n\nThe report comes days before a major UN climate conference starting in Poland from 2-14 December.\n\nWhat is the emissions gap?\n\nFor the last nine years, UN Environment have produced an assessment of the latest scientific studies on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nIt highlights the difference between the level of greenhouse gas emissions that the world can sustain to keep temperatures within safe limits, with the levels that are likely based on the promises and actions taken by countries.\n\nThis year's report records the largest gap yet between where we are and where we need to be.\n\nWhy are emissions rising again?\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, global emissions of CO2 from industry and the production of energy were essentially stable while the global economy grew modestly - but in 2017 these emissions went up by 1.2% pushed along by higher GDP.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption While renewable energy sources are booming in countries like India, carbon emissions haven't yet peaked\n\nWhile the rise might seem small, it needs to be seen in context of efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C, as recently outlined in a key IPCC report.\n\nAccording to the UN, to keep the world below that target, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be 55% lower than today.\n\n\"There is still a tremendous gap between words and deeds, between the targets agreed by governments worldwide to stabilise our climate and the measures to achieve these goals,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and one of the authors of the study.\n\nThe scientists say that to tackle the gap, nations must raise their ambition five fold to meet the 1.5C goal.\n\nRight now, the world is heading for a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century the report says.\n\nNo peaking?\n\nOne key aspect of the study is about the peaking of global greenhouse emissions.\n\nThe report says that peaking of emissions in 2020 is \"crucial for achieving the temperature targets in the Paris agreement,\" but the scale of the current efforts is insufficient.\n\nThe study says that by 2030, around 57 countries representing about 60% of global emissions will have peaked. Nowhere near where the world needs to be.\n\nDoes the report point the finger at countries that are doing badly?\n\nIn some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions\n\nThree countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets.\n\nThe authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans.\n\nIs there any positive news in the report?\n\nUndoubtedly, yes.\n\nThe UN is placing great hopes in what it terms \"non-state actors\", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap.\n\nThey estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action.\n\nBut the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries.\"\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThis report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition.\n\n\"Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,\" said Dr Gunnar Luderer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "'Siberian unicorn' walked Earth with humans", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46358789", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright W S Van der Merwe Image caption Artist's impression of the 'forgotten beast'\n\nA giant rhino that may have been the origin of the unicorn myth survived until at least 39,000 years ago - much longer than previously thought.\n\nKnown as the Siberian unicorn, the animal had a long horn on its nose, and roamed the grasslands of Eurasia.\n\nNew evidence shows the hefty beast may have eventually died out because it was such a picky eater.\n\nScientists say knowing more about the animal's extinction could help save the remaining rhinos on the planet.\n\nRhinos are in particular danger of extinction because they are very picky about their habitat, said Prof Adrian Lister of the Natural History Museum, London, who led the study.\n\n\"Any change in their environment is a danger for them,\" he told BBC News. \"And, of course, what we've also learned from the fossil record is that once a species is gone, that's it, it's gone for good.\"\n\nWeighing in at a mighty four tonnes, with an extraordinary single horn on its head, the \"Siberian unicorn\", shared the earth with early modern humans up until at least 39,000 years ago.\n\nImage copyright Igor Doronin Image caption Skeleton of the rhino at the Stavropol Museum\n\nWhat do we know about the ancient rhino?\n\nThe rhino, Elasmotherium sibericum, was thought to have become extinct between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago.\n\nBy radiocarbon-dating a total of 23 specimens, researchers found the Ice Age giant in fact survived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago.\n\nThey also isolated DNA from the ancient rhino for the first time, showing it split from the modern group of rhinos about 40 million years ago.\n\nThe extinction of the Siberian unicorn marks the end point of an entire group of rhinos.\n\nWhy might it have gone extinct?\n\nThe study also involved examining the animals' teeth, confirming they grazed on tough, dry grasses.\n\n\"It was walking along like a kind of prehistoric lawnmower really...it's just grazing along the ground,\" said Prof Lister.\n\nThe rhino's specialised diet may have been its downfall. As the Earth warmed up and started to emerge from the Ice Age around 40,000 years ago, grasslands started to shrink, likely pushing the animal to extinction.\n\nHundreds of large mammal species disappeared after the last Ice Age, due to climate change, loss of vegetation and human hunting.\n\nWhat does it tell us about the fate of modern rhinos?\n\nToday there are just five remaining species of rhino. Very few survive outside national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades.\n\nBy studying fossilised rhinos, scientists can learn more about the fate of the many prehistoric rhino species that once roamed the planet and how they adapted to climate change and human pressures.\n\nWhere do unicorn myths come from?\n\nLegends of the unicorn, or a beast with a single horn, have been around for millennia.\n\nSome have argued that the horn of the rhino may have been the basis of myths about unicorns, although other animals - such as the tusked narwhal - are more likely contenders.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mars: Nasa lands InSight robot to study planet's interior", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46351114", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPL Image caption InSight quickly returned its first image from Elysium Planitia\n\nThe US space agency Nasa has landed a new robot on Mars after a dramatic seven-minute plunge to the surface of the Red Planet.\n\nThe InSight probe aims to study the world's deep interior, and make it the only planet - apart from Earth - that has been examined in this way.\n\nConfirmation of touchdown came through on cue at 19:53 GMT.\n\nIt ended an anxious wait in which the robot radioed home a series of updates on its descent.\n\nNasa's mission control at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) erupted into cheers when it became clear InSight was safe on the ground.\n\nThe agency's chief administrator, James Bridenstine, celebrated what he called \"an amazing day\". President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that \"to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers.\"\n\nInSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator.

It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings.\n\nThe image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon.\n\nA later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance\n\nWhat happened in the landing?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California\n\nLike all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair.\n\nStage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress.\n\nIt had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop.\n\nInSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent.\n\nThe robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth\n\nWhat is different about the InSight mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Banerdt: \"Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries\"\n\nWhy do we need to know this?\n\nScientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

A ticking clock. A cagey adversary.\n\n\n\nThe man who calls himself a supreme dealmaker will have the opportunity this week to put himself to the test. The question is whether he can defuse a trade war with China that is shaking financial markets and threatening the global economy \u2014 and perhaps achieve something approximating a breakthrough.\n\n\n\nTrump is to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday and Saturday. Unless the two leaders can achieve a truce of sorts, their conflicts will likely escalate: On Jan. 1, the tariffs Trump has imposed on many Chinese goods are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent, and Beijing would likely retaliate.\n\n\n\nMost analysts have said they doubt Trump and Xi will reach any overarching deal that would settle the dispute for good. The optimistic view is that the two sides may agree to a cease-fire that would buy time for more substantive talks and postpone the scheduled escalation in U.S import taxes.\n\n\n\nYet no one really knows. Each side seems prepared to wait out the other in a conflict that could persist indefinitely.\n\n\n\nIn advance of the meeting, Trump has sounded his usual note of boastful confidence. Speaking to reporters on Thanksgiving Day, he said:\n\n\n\n\"I'm very prepared. You know, it's not like, 'Oh, gee, I'm going to sit down and study.' I know every stat. I know it better than anybody knows it. And my gut has always been right.\"\n\n\n\nMost trade analysts are skeptical that any significant agreement is likely this week.\n\n\n\n\"Expectations should be very low,\" said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Institute and a former U.S. trade official who negotiated with China. \"We need to be very clear-eyed. It's going to be a very difficult negotiation. The issues at hand don't lend themselves to quick solutions.\"\n\n\n\nThe trade war erupted last fall after Trump imposed import taxes on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and Beijing retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports. The justification for the U.S. move, according to Trump, is that Beijing has long deployed predatory tactics in its drive to supplant America's technological dominance. The administration alleges \u2014 and many trade experts agree \u2014 that Beijing hacks into U.S. companies' networks to steal trade secrets and forces American and other foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology as the price of access to China's market.\n\n\n\nBeijing disputes those allegations and asserts that Trump's sanctions are merely an effort to hinder an ambitious rival.\n\n\n\nBesides the scheduled escalation in U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods \u2014 an additional $50 billion in Chinese imports already face the higher tax \u2014 another threat looms: Trump has threatened to tax $267 billion more in Chinese imports. At that point, just about everything Beijing ships to the United States would face a higher import tax.\n\nGrowing concerns that the trade war will increasingly hurt corporate earnings and the U.S. economy are a key reason why U.S. stock prices have been sinking. As of Friday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500 index has shed roughly 10 of its value since setting a record high Sept. 20.\n\n\n\nJoining other forecasters, economists at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development last week downgraded their outlook for global economic growth next year to 3.5 percent from a previous 3.7 percent. In doing so, they cited the trade conflict as well as political uncertainty.\n\n\n\nSome big U.S. companies, in reporting quarterly earnings in October, warned that they were absorbing higher costs from Trump's increased tariffs, which have been imposed not only on Chinese goods but also on imported steel and other goods from other countries.\n\n\n\n\"We need some certainty,\" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council and a former American diplomat. \"The U.S. and China cannot go into a trade war and not affect global markets ... We need to resolve our differences.\"\n\nYet as Trump and Xi prepare to meet, the backdrop is hardly encouraging. Acrimony between the two sides disrupted this month's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea. The 21 APEC countries, torn by differences between Beijing and Washington, failed to agree on a declaration on world trade for the first time in nearly three decades. Vice President Mike Pence and Xi sniped at each other in speeches.\n\nThen last week, U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer issued a report charging China's efforts to steal U.S. trade secrets have \"increased in frequency and sophistication\" this year despite American sanctions.\n\n\n\n\"China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation, and indeed appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months,\" the report concluded.\n\n\n\nThe tenor of the report suggested that the United States would take a hard line into this week's talks. In the meantime, \"the amount of uncertainty is unprecedented and very disquieting to the markets,\" said Allen of the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n\n\nTrump himself sought Monday to increase the pressure on China. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said it was \"highly unlikely\" that he would agree to Beijing's request to suspend the tariff hikes that are set to take effect Jan. 1. And he repeated his threat to target an additional $267 billion in Chinese imports with tariffs of 10 percent or 25 percent.\n\n\n\nClouding the outlook are mixed messages from the Trump administration. The White House appears divided between hawks like Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, and free traders like the top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow. On Nov. 9, Navarro delivered a combative speech suggesting that Trump didn't care what Wall Street thought of his confrontational China policy.\n\nFour days later, Kudlow went on CNBC and dismissed Navarro's remarks as \"way off base.\"'\n\n\n\n\"They were not authorized by anybody,\" Kudlow said. \"I actually think he did the president a great disservice.\"\n\n\n\nRegardless of which approach Trump takes to Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi don't have to resolve their differences this week. A cease-fire that suspends any further escalation of the U.S. tariffs wouldn't be unprecedented. The administration and the European Union, for instance, reached a truce last summer that suspended threatened U.S. tariffs on European auto imports.\n\n\n\n\"My personal guess \u2014 and I'm sticking my neck out here \u2014 is that there will be some kind of cease-fire agreed to,\" said Matthew Goodman, a senior adviser on Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\n\nGoodman noted that Trump appears concerned about tumbling stock prices, and Xi is contending with a decelerating Chinese economy. A truce would bring at least a temporary calm.\n\n\n\n\"No one is expecting they will come out with a solid agreement,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"What the market wants \u2014 what the market needs \u2014 is a sense that they are negotiating and that the negotiations will continue.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Pacific Storm to Bring Rain, Mountain Snow to California", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pacific-storm-to-bring-rain-mountain-snow-to-california/4677520.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "California will see widespread rain and heavy Sierra Nevada snowfall through midweek, potentially bringing travel problems and raising the risk of damaging runoff from wildfire burn scars, forecasters said Tuesday.\n\nThe wet pattern from a deep atmospheric fetch of Pacific moisture marks a significant change in the weather following conditions that contributed to disastrous and deadly wildfires up and down California, where hundreds of thousands of acres have burned this year.\n\n\u201cThis is good news to help minimize that fire activity,\u201d Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said . \u201cBut remember that if you are in an area that has seen recent fires this year or latter part of last year it could mean trouble as that soil is much more prone to mudslides and debris flow.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service said there was a risk of heavy rainfall in northwest California through Tuesday night, then spreading farther south down virtually all of the coastal ranges and some interior sections of the state through Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nSnow accumulations in the Sierra could range from 2-4 feet (0.6-1.2 meters), the NWS said.\n\nIn the Sierra, chain controls were put into effect on Interstate 80 between Kingvale and the Donner Lake interchange, the California Department of Transportation said.\n\nOn the coast near Big Sur, Caltrans planned to close a section of Highway 1 between Mud Creek and Paul's Slide for 48 hours starting Wednesday morning because of potential instability.\n\nThe scenic route perched between towering mountainsides and the ocean has been dogged by slides since late 2016.

The secession led to the country's deadly Civil War that ended with the South's defeat and surrender in 1865.\n\nBut racial disputes endured for decades in Mississippi, with lynchings of black residents and segregation of the races in virtually all aspects of life, including schools, restaurants and other public accommodations, until the 1960s.\n\nHyde-Smith drew quick scorn when she said that if a political supporter invited her \"to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" She apologized \"to anyone offended\" by the remark, but photos of her also surfaced of her holding Confederate memorabilia from the Civil War.\n\nIn another campaign comment, she suggested \"maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult\" for liberal college students to vote.\n\nHyde-Smith contended that Espy had misconstrued her lynching remarks. But the Democrat rebuffed her.\n\n\"No one twisted your comments, because your comments were live, it came out of your mouth. I don't know what's in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth. It's caused our state harm. It's given our state another black eye that we don't need,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, state authorities removed two nooses and six hate signs they found on the grounds of the Mississippi State Capitol.\n\nRepublicans depicted Espy as out of touch with the state, where he once served as a congressman, and lacking in judgment. He once faced corruption charges \u2014 receiving favors while he was the country's agriculture chief in the 1990s \u2014 although he was acquitted."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Report: Trump Says 'Not Even a Little Bit Happy' with Fed's Powell", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-trump-says-not-even-a-little-bit-happy-with-fed-s-powell/4677582.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday kept up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying rising interest rates and other Fed policies were damaging the U.S. economy, the Washington Post said.\n\n\"So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay,\" the Post quoted Trump as saying in an interview, referring to the man he picked last year to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Not even a little bit.

Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company's strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware.\n\nGmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched.\n\nSmart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages.\n\nA system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is \"he\" or \"him.\" The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.\n\nLambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.\n\n\"The only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,\" said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.\n\nNew policy\n\nGoogle's decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company's predictive technologies.\n\nThe company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine's autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query \"are jews evil\" when users sought information about Jews.\n\nGoogle has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.\n\nThe company's new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google's Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as \"sounds good.\"\n\nGoogle uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find \"juicy\" gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.\n\nWorkers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.\n\n\"You need a lot of human oversight,\" said engineering leader Raghavan, because \"in each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.\"\n\nWispread challenge\n\nGoogle is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem. Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents.\n\nIts technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo's chief technology officer.\n\nHe said longer copy is better than missing details. \"The smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,\" AlTantawy said. \"People want 100 percent correct.\"\n\nYet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered \"policeman\" to complete \"police\" and \"salesman\" for \"sales.\"\n\nType the neutral Turkish phrase \"one is a soldier\" into Google Translate and it spits out \"he's a soldier\" in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc opts for \"she\" for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.\n\nAI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.\n\nMicrosoft's LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders.\n\nAlibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment.

Bush, among many others.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way he could do that sort of trip right now,\u201d Hellyer said. The crown prince\u2019s plan to attend the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires \u201ctells me that he feels that he\u2019s ridden out the storm, or that in order for him to ride out the storm this is exactly what he needs to do.\u201d\n\nAfter denying any knowledge of Khashoggi\u2019s death for weeks, Saudi authorities eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed in an operation aimed at forcibly bringing the writer back to the kingdom. Saudi prosecutors say the plan was masterminded by two former advisers to the crown prince and are now seeking the death penalty for five people allegedly involved in the killing.\n\nThat seems to have settled the matter for Trump, who issued an extraordinary statement last week saying the U.S. would not take further action after sanctioning 17 individuals linked to the killing. Trump has brushed aside assessments by U.S. intelligence and other experts that the crown prince must have been involved in the high-level operation, and said he would maintain close relations with Saudi Arabia in part because of its oil wealth and its multi-billion-dollar purchases of U.S. arms.\n\nTrump\u2019s contention that \u201cmaybe he did, maybe he didn\u2019t\u201d order the killing appears to have helped pave the way for the crown prince\u2019s return to international forums.\n\nBut even if Trump shakes his hand at the G-20 summit, the crown prince could still remain persona non grata within Washington\u2019s beltway, where members of Congress from both parties have demanded stronger action, as well as Wall Street and Silicon Valley.\n\nHe could also get an icy reception from other leaders at the G-20. In Europe there have been calls to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and Canada could still be smarting from a diplomatic row sparked by Saudi anger at its criticism over human rights in the kingdom. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is expected to attend the summit, was instrumental to the global backlash the prince now faces.\n\nDespite the international outrage, the crown prince\u2019s decision to travel to Argentina signals that he still has the strong support of his 82-year-old father, King Salman, and faces no major threat at home.\n\nOn his first stop on the tour, in the United Arab Emirates, the crown prince was embraced on the tarmac by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, a close ally who has reportedly served as a mentor to the 33-year-old royal. The crown prince attended the Formula One Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, where he was filmed in a VIP box chatting with the former King of Spain Juan Carlos and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nIn possible a sign of changes underway, Prince Mohammed embarked on his foreign tour with figures who may take on greater prominence as he redraws his circle of advisers. Those include Minister of State Mohammad Al Shaikh, Chief of General Intelligence Khalid al-Humaidan and royal court adviser Prince Turki bin Mohammed bin Fahd, among others.\n\nThe two close advisers implicated in the Khashoggi killing \u2014 Saud al-Qahtani, a royal court adviser who was a friend of the crown prince, and Ahmed al-Assiri, a general whom the crown prince had promoted to a top intelligence post \u2014 were fired last month. The crown prince himself oversees all major levers of power in the kingdom, including the military and security forces.\n\nSaudi analyst Mohammed Alyahya said that over the past two years many state institutions in the kingdom were marginalized in favor of a quicker, ad hoc decision-making process led by people with newfound power.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real understanding, I think, in the kingdom, that there needs to be serious structural change to ensure that something like this can never happen again,\u201d Alyahya said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see definitely some return to institutionalism, some return to a consensus-based decision-making process and commitment to defined procedures.\u201d\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether a wider circle of advisers will be consulted, whether they will challenge the crown prince and whether he will listen to them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unaware that he employs anybody deliberately who will tell him \u2018that\u2019s a really bad idea,\u2019\u201d said Simon Henderson, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has written extensively about the crown prince."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Top GOP Senator Says Texas Is 'No Longer A Reliably Red State'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-cornyn-texas-purple-state_us_5bfe3706e4b030172fa83705", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen.

Phil Bryant (R) to fill the seat vacated by veteran Sen. Thad Cochran (R), who stepped down for health reasons. She became the first woman to represent Mississippi in the Senate.

The Guardian on Tuesday said the pair met several times, in 2013, 2015 and around March 2016, although it\u2019s unclear what they spoke about.

The special counsel\u2019s office has been working on a plea negotiation with Corsi, although such talks have reportedly collapsed.\n\nThe Post notes that the account demonstrates WikiLeaks may play a central role in any case Mueller is building as part of his probe.\n\nTrump himself has gone on the attack this week, regularly lambasting the Mueller inquiry on Twitter and in interviews.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace,\u201d he said in a message on Tuesday, calling the probe a \u201cPhony Witch Hunt\u201d in another.\n\n\u201cMueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other,\u201d the president said. \u201cWait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie.

The Senate is voting this week to advance Farr\u2019s nomination, with a final confirmation vote likely either late this week or next week.\n\nThe 64-year-old attorney helped write North Carolina\u2019s extreme voter ID law in 2013 that was later struck down by a federal appeals court, which found that it targeted African-Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d Farr defended racially discriminatory gerrymandering in federal court in 2015 (and lost), and he may have lied to the Senate about his role in disenfranchising black voters in 1990 when he worked for the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).\n\nFarr\u2019s chances of confirmation come down to a handful of GOP senators who have been evasive about how they\u2019ll vote. Republicans hold such a slim majority in the Senate that if just two GOP senators join Democrats in opposing Farr, his nomination would go down. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has already said he will oppose all of Trump\u2019s nominees until he gets a vote on a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller. That puts Farr\u2019s current vote count at 50-50, which means Vice President Mike Pence would have to break the tie even if all the other GOP senators vote yes.\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups are holding out hope that Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) will join them in voting no. They have reason to be hopeful: In addition to being the lone African-American senator in his party, Scott holds the rare distinction of being a Republican senator who previously opposed one of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, circuit court pick Ryan Bounds \u2015 and it was over Bounds\u2019 racist writings in college. Scott\u2019s vote tanked that nominee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that if he opposed the 9th Circuit nominee based on his college writings that he could possibly vote for this nominee, whose entire career is aimed at African-Americans,\u201d said D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), who leads the Congressional Black Caucus\u2019 task force on judicial nominations. \u201cSo I am very hopeful, even though I have not had any indication from the senator\u2019s office, that he is studying this and will try to make this vote consistent with his prior vote.\u201d\n\nScott refused to answer any questions about Farr on Tuesday, telling reporters that he is still \u201cdoing my homework\u201d on a nominee who has been out there for over a year.\n\n\u201cI have no answers on the Farr nomination whatsoever,\u201d Scott told HuffPost, adding that he doesn\u2019t plan to speak with him again. \u201cI met with him months ago.\u201d\n\nFarr\u2019s opponents are also looking to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to join them. She recently opposed Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, and she has occasionally voted with Democrats on issues like health care and abortion.\n\nAsked about Farr on Tuesday, Murkowski told HuffPost that she has made up her mind on how she\u2019ll vote but doesn\u2019t want to share it.\n\nEarlier in the day, a Murkowski aide said the senator \u201cdoesn\u2019t plan on blocking\u201d Farr\u2019s nomination. But the aide did not clarify whether that meant Murkowski would be voting to advance Farr\u2019s nomination on the procedural vote but not necessarily voting to confirm him in the end.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in September 2017, Farr faced questions about his work as a lawyer for Helms. Just before Election Day that year, Helms\u2019 campaign targeted black voters with over 100,000 postcards that had incorrect information about voter qualifications. The postcards warned readers that they could face criminal charges for illegally voting, an intimidation tactic. Farr testified that he did not know about the scheme, but a former Justice Department official said Farr attended a meeting about \u201cballot security\u201d before the postcards were sent out.\n\n\u201cHe had absolutely nothing to do with the racist postcard that was sent out,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cHe, in fact, told me that he was disgusted by it and he clearly played no role in drafting it, approving it or even seeing it.\u201d\n\nCollins said she will vote to confirm Farr because the American Bar Association rated him \u201cwell qualified.\u201d She also said, unexpectedly, that her concerns were alleviated in part because Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel for President Barack Obama, \u201cstrongly supports\u201d Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the committee was unaware of any letter of support from Ruemmler with regard to Farr\u2019s nomination. Ruemmler did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCivil rights groups have been fighting Farr\u2019s nomination for nearly a year. On Tuesday, they organized a last-minute call with reporters to walk through the details of his decades-long career of disenfranchising black voters.\n\n\u201cFarr is the embodiment of Trump\u2019s anti-civil rights agenda,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cHe is an egregious extension of the administration\u2019s campaign to build barriers to voting.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "What The Obamacare Fight Says About Nancy Pelosi", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-obamacare-leadership_us_5bfdc95de4b030172fa7f593", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "House Democrats will vote on next year\u2019s speaker Wednesday, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appears poised to get majority support from her caucus, as centrists and progressives alike have been dropping their objections to her candidacy in recent days.\n\nShe might still be a few votes short of what she will ultimately need in January \u2015 a majority of the entire House \u2015 to become speaker. And at the moment, the biggest pocket of opposition comes from centrist Democrats and those from more conservative districts, which is no surprise. In her more than 30 years in the House and more than 15 years as a member of Democratic leadership, Pelosi has been a bogeyman for conservatives, and centrist Democrats have kept their distance from her for years.\n\nBut Pelosi is also confronting more skepticism from the left than at any other time in her career.\n\nThe \u201cSan Francisco liberal\u201d caricatured by the right now faces protests outside her office from progressive activists demanding stronger action on climate change. She\u2019s catching grief from progressives appalled at her pledge to match new spending with cuts or taxes, making it much more difficult to enact expansive initiatives like free college tuition.\n\nOther progressive gripes with Pelosi include her vow to work with Trump on their limited areas of common interest, starting with infrastructure, and her failure to embrace a single-payer Medicare for all health care program, which has become a litmus test for progressives.\n\nPelosi defenders frequently cite her role in the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic accomplishment of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and her four-year tenure as Speaker. But to many progressives ambivalent about the law because of its shortcomings and compromises, that episode only shows that Pelosi is too close to monied interests and has been too quick to compromise with centrists.\n\nKey players from that drama, including elected officials, staff and lobbyists, see things differently. They say Pelosi battled with Senate Democrats and the White House to make legislation more progressive \u2015 and fought hard. They say she cut deals because it was the only way to get a bill through Congress and onto Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nIf Nancy Pelosi had not been the House Speaker in the 111th Congress, the Affordable Care Act would never have been enacted. Ron Pollack, former executive director of Families USA\n\nThese were not decisions Pelosi took lightly or without understanding what most House Democrats wanted, said former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who infamously declared health care reform dead in early 2010, only for Pelosi and other party leaders to prove him wrong. There simply weren\u2019t enough votes in Congress to pass a more progressive health care bill, and Pelosi knew it, he said.\n\n\u201cCounting is not simply an act of figuring out where they are. It\u2019s shorthand for talking to each member, finding out what each thinks is important,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAnd then she has a very good sense of where the point would be where you can attract most of the members.\u201d\n\nFrank and other veterans of the health care fight in 2009 and 2010 point out what the years since this bruising legislative battle, and a leftward shift within the Democratic Party, have obscured \u2015 namely, that the reform effort nearly foundered on more than one occasion.\n\nThe bill was widely assumed to be hopeless after Republican Scott Brown won a special election for the Senate seat of the late Democrat Edward Kennedy in January 2010. This deprived Democrats of the filibuster-proof majority that passed the upper chamber\u2019s more moderate version of the health care bill \u2015 and Pelosi was as responsible as anybody for figuring out a way to pass legislation in the aftermath.\n\n\u201cIf Nancy Pelosi had not been the House Speaker in the 111th Congress, the Affordable Care Act would never have been enacted because Pelosi, time and again, made the difference in getting the law passed,\u201d said Ron Pollack, who, as executive director of the liberal advocacy organization Families USA at the time, was deeply involved in advancing the legislation.\n\nPelosi And The Public Option\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has provided health coverage to about 20 million people and decreased the national uninsured rate to the lowest level ever recorded. Few progressives question that Pelosi had a big hand in passing legislation, although many who weren\u2019t part of the health care reform fight nearly a decade ago don\u2019t understand just why her role was so vital.\n\nBut if progressives are happy to acknowledge Pelosi\u2019s work on behalf of reform, they are not so happy about what that effort produced.\n\nThey wish, among other things, that the law offered more generous assistance to make health coverage affordable and included a public option \u2015 that is, a government-run insurance program that would compete alongside private carriers offering coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-run exchanges. The public option was intended as a key compromise to progressives who preferred a more government-centric system like single-payer to the private-based Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe irony of this line of criticism is that Pelosi said repeatedly she was on the side of those who wanted a public option. The legislation the House passed in 2009, under her leadership, offered such a plan \u2015 despite opposition from conservative Democrats and lobbyists from major industries, such as hospitals, that believed a public option would pay them less and thus hurt their revenue streams.\n\nLiberals ultimately went along, said Henry Waxman, the retired California Democratic congressman who chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee at the time and one of the law\u2019s chief authors, precisely because Pelosi had fought so hard for it earlier in the process. That gave her credibility when she said it was the best deal possible under the circumstances.\n\n\u201cShe had very strong feelings about a public option. She said she wanted a public option, you know I am on your side. I will count all the votes, see where we are. She showed us in the caucus that the votes just weren\u2019t there,\u201d Waxman said.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wields the gavel in 2007 as the first woman to serve as speaker of the House.\n\nPelosi And The Senate\n\nThe legislation didn\u2019t simply need to pass the House, of course. It had to get through the Senate, too. And there, things were even tougher.\n\nDemocrats had 60 votes in the Senate in 2009, the minimum needed to overcome Republican filibusters of their legislation. A handful of centrist Democratic senators \u2015 especially Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana \u2015 and independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut held virtual veto power over the Senate\u2019s entire agenda and were opposed to a public option in any form.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) finally gave up on a public option after months of trying to accommodate centrist demands. Another reason Reid struggled was that the White House, which backed the public option but didn\u2019t exert much effort on its behalf, had cut deals with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that opposed the public option to gain their support for health care reform.\n\n\u201cThe president cut her legs out when he cut the deal with pharma and he cut a deal with the hospital association,\u201d former Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said of Pelosi. \u201cThose two agreements right there announced by the White House just really basically killed the public option.\u201d\n\nPelosi led the House\u2019s negotiations with the White House and Senate Democratic leaders and, by all accounts, forcefully argued for the House\u2019s version of the bill. But she ran into the same objections, from the same centrist senators, that had stymied Reid.\n\nPelosi In The Final Stretch\n\nThose negotiations hadn\u2019t yet ended when political catastrophe struck Democrats. With Brown taking that Massachusetts Senate seat and Democrats losing their 60th vote, legislation wasn\u2019t going to pass over solidified GOP opposition. Brown had campaigned in part on his opposition to \u201cObamacare.\u201d In Washington, even some elected officials and advocates who supported the legislation, like Frank, figured that would be the end of health care reform.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people, including strong progressives, who, with that election result, said the Affordable Care Act was dead,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the only way forward was for the House to approve legislation that the Senate had already passed, as written, on a promise that the Senate would then approve a series of amendments that could get through the budget reconciliation process, through which filibusters can\u2019t stop a majority from passing bills. It was not an ideal solution, Pelosi knew, because Senate procedural rules limited the kinds of changes that could go through this type of legislation \u2015 and liberals in her caucus, especially, would have a hard time with it.\n\n\u201cThe Nancy Pelosi I know would stick to her guns, would stick to her principles, she would not cave,\u201d Max Baucus, who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee authored most of the more moderate bill that wound up law. \u201cShe was a very good, pragmatic, practical negotiator representing her House, as a good speaker would. She\u2019s more liberal than I, but she wanted to do deals,\u201d Baucus said.\n\nPelosi persisted, reminding members of her caucus that Democrats had been fighting for universal coverage for decades \u2015 and that even a flawed bill was worth passing, especially because it would be possible to amend and improve the law later on, just like previous generations of lawmakers had done with Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\n\n\u201cShe understood full well that this was the only way that we could pass the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nPelosi And Abortion\n\nStupak spent most of the health care reform effort locked in a battle with Pelosi and other pro-choice Democrats about abortion. As he details in his 2017 book, For All Americans (The Dramatic Story Behind the Stupak Amendment and the Historic Passage of Obamacare), Stupak had many complaints about the way Pelosi handled his demands that the Affordable Care Act include strict language prohibiting federal dollars from paying for elective abortions.\n\nStupak eventually lost that legislative fight but struck a deal with Obama, who signed an executive order seeking the same effect. Abortion rights activists, like former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, still consider that a major progressive victory. \u201cI credit her with not only saving a pretty important right to women but also getting the bill passed,\u201d Richards said.\n\nBut even without his abortion language, Stupak said in an interview, the bill was a big step forward for expanding coverage and reforming the health care system \u2015 and that Pelosi deserves praise for it.\n\nWhen some congressional Democrats and a contingent of senior White House aides wanted to give up on the Affordable Care Act and move a less ambitious health care bill after Brown\u2019s election, Pelosi stood firm, Stupak said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t back down from the idea that we could have universal health care coverage,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "3 Weeks After The Fire, One Paradise Property Owner Is Still Searching For His Residents", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/northern-california-wildfire-ridgewood-mobile-home-park_us_5bf610c1e4b03b230f9e8777", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "PARADISE, Calif. \u2015 The residents of Ridgewood Mobile Home Park had decorated the front of their homes with ceramic frogs, small statues of angels and potted plants lining winding red-brick walkways. They were churchgoing people, all over the age of 55. Like many other Paradise residents, they chose the town for its scenic beauty and affordable cost of living.\n\nThree weeks after the Camp fire scorched more than 150,000 acres in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas and burned Paradise to the ground, all that\u2019s left of the 97 structures in the close-knit retirement community of Ridgewood are the frames of its homes, the cinder blocks that held them and the homey accessories outside the doorsteps.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to determine conclusively what has happened to each of the residents. The property owner, Glenn Fuller, and two on-site managers are still actively trying to account for them all \u2015 about 150 people in total, according to the former on-site manager Cathy King. Butte County officials were unable to confirm how many have been found and how many haven\u2019t. The official list of missing people is still in flux. And because of their age, many of the community\u2019s residents don\u2019t have cellphones or communicate over email or social media, adding to the difficulty in tracking them down.\n\n***\n\nParadise wasn\u2019t a rich place \u2015 the town had a large homeless population, many residents struggled with addiction and job insecurity, and Ridgewood was one of several mobile home parks \u2015 but it was a vibrant retirement town where lower-income retirees could comfortably make a home for themselves.\n\nRidgewood was situated at the east edge of Paradise, on Pentz Road, with striking views of forest pines and the West Branch Feather River. At the back of the property, toward the river, there was a lot where residents could park their RVs.\n\nJenavieve Hatch/HuffPost Every mobile home was destroyed at Ridgewood but many residents' law decor was still standing.\n\nMany of the families and individuals who lived at Ridgewood had lived there for decades, Fuller, who has owned the property since 1996, told HuffPost. He described the community as \u201ctight-knit.\u201d There wasn\u2019t much space between homes; residents knew their neighbors well. All 97 mobiles were situated on two long roads, the \u201cupper road\u201d and \u201clower road.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to know your neighbors when you\u2019re that close,\u201d King, who managed the property with her husband from 2014 until last June, and who lived on the property for several years as well, told HuffPost. King recalled the many times residents called her in as an extra for a game of pinochle or bunco, how those who still drove helped run errands for those who didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey knew each other. They cared for each other.\u201d\n\nMany of them were on a fixed income and were immobile, dependent on oxygen tanks and the kindness of their neighbors.\n\nOn Nov. 8, the day of the fire, as the flames barreled west down the foothills, Ridgewood residents were some of the first to see it coming toward the town \u2015 and they didn\u2019t have much time to evacuate.\n\nThe two on-site property managers went door-to-door around 8 a.m., alerting residents on their own, Fuller said. Some were still asleep. Some were having breakfast, completely unaware of what was coming toward them. As was common for the community, those with the ability to drive helped those who couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBy the time [residents] got to Pentz Road, the trees were on fire at the other end of the park, and burning leaves were coming down around them,\u201d Fuller told HuffPost. \u201cPeople were just fleeing at that point with the clothes on their back, and some of them hadn\u2019t even dressed yet.\u201d\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost A Cal Fire firefighter assess damage at Ridgewood one week after the blaze destroyed Paradise, California.\n\nOne resident, Jim, picked up the wife of another neighbor knowing that her husband was out and she couldn\u2019t drive. Two other residents, Ruth and Linda, didn\u2019t evacuate until they\u2019d picked up their neighbor Billie. Many of the park\u2019s residents made sure to check on their neighbors, according to Fuller, and helped one another escape the fast-moving flames.\n\nBut not all residents made it out. The remains of Teresa Ammons, who was 82 and had lived in the park for years, were found just 2 feet outside of her mobile home.\n\nAmmons generally kept to herself, King told HuffPost. King used to drive her to get groceries, and they would sometimes share a glass of wine together. Over time, they became friends.\n\n\u201cI think she died trying to get out.\u201d\n\nFuller and King, as well as the two current property managers, are now working to compile a definitive list of what happened to the community. They are calling relatives and shelters, watching Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office press conferences and updating one another when they\u2019ve heard from someone.\n\nMost of the residents they\u2019ve heard from were able to evacuate to homes of family or friends, rather than the shelters in Chico, Orland, Oroville and Gridley.\n\nAs Fuller continues to try to account for each resident, first responders and law enforcement have identified some of them as deceased.\n\nNow, those who are in shelters are facing the difficult prospect of rebuilding from the ashes.\n\nIn churches in neighboring towns of Chico, Orland, and Oroville, evacuees were crammed onto cots alongside hundreds of other displaced people last Friday. Some shelters faced an outbreak of norovirus. The situation was similarly bleak at a Walmart parking lot where hundreds had set up with tents and RVs despite the rain and cold, hoping that the open air would prevent them from catching the norovirus that plagued indoor shelters.\n\nVolunteers from churches, organizations, hospitals and neighboring towns were doing what they could, including laundry, cooking, checking up on mental and physical health, bleaching floors, cleaning portable bathrooms and helping evacuees recover lost paperwork. Their generosity was remarkable, and warmly welcomed by evacuees, but it\u2019s an unsustainable response to a catastrophe.\n\n***\n\n\u201cThis is very sad to see,\u201d President Donald Trump said a week ago while visiting Paradise, which he repeatedly called \u201cPleasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think hopefully this will be the last of these,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis was a really, really bad one.\u201d When asked if the ruins of the town altered his views on climate change, he responded curtly: \u201cNo, no.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had set up shop at the Chico Mall. The line for assistance wrapped around the building. There were rumors that Trump would visit the FEMA center; people in line shuffled their feet and looked around anxiously at any sound of a siren or helicopter, eager to see if the president would make an appearance."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "World\u2019s First Gene-Edited Babies Could Set Genetic Science Backward, Experts Worry", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gene-edited-babies-hiv-scientists_us_5bfd80eae4b0771fb6bed214", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Ethicists and medical experts in the U.S. say that the use of gene editing to make babies resistant to HIV infection is a step too far \u2015 and could be a step back for genetic science.\n\nNews broke early Monday morning that Chinese scientist He Jiankui altered the genetic code of two embryos to make them resistant to HIV, and then transferred them to a woman who later gave birth to two girls \u2015 twin sisters.\n\nWhile his claims have yet to be verified, He says that one baby has two sets of the altered CCR5 gene, which he hopes will prevent HIV from being able to enter her cells if she were to ever come in contact with the virus. The other baby only appears to have one set of altered CCR5 genes, which may not protect her completely from HIV infection but may extend her life if she were to become infected.\n\nWhile He is trying to present his findings as a boon for the HIV community, researchers and bioethicists in the U.S. say the announcement has left them baffled and concerned.\n\nHIV researchers are interested in gene editing, but not the way He did it, said Paul Volberding, co-director of the University of California, San Francisco Gladstone Center for AIDS Research.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the risks, and here healthy, uninfected people are being used. Paul Volberding, co-director of the University of California, San Francisco Gladstone Center for AIDS Research\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very interested in ways that gene editing might be employed in attempting to cure HIV infection, but its use to prevent infection seems seriously misguided,\u201d Volberding said. \u201cHIV infection can easily be prevented with antiretroviral drugs.\u201d\n\nAnd given that treatments and therapies already exist to prevent HIV transmission from parent to child, he finds it \u201cvery troubling\u201d that scientists would put these babies through these untested methods.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the risks, and here healthy, uninfected people are being used,\u201d Volberding said.\n\nSome of these risks include the yet-unknown consequences of permanently altering a gene, which would then get passed on to subsequent generations. For example, The Associated Press, which broke the story, notes that people with abnormal CCR5 genes are more prone to dying from the flu and contracting West Nile Virus.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS He Jiankui, the scientist who claims he altered the genes of two embryos to make them more resistant to HIV before transferring them into a woman.\n\nGlobally, the world\u2019s scientists agree that while \u201cgermline\u201d gene editing \u2015 alterations in gamete cells or embryos that will be passed down to future generations \u2015 may one day be a part of our society, it would be irresponsible to use it in human beings until techniques have been deemed safe and effective, and until there is a \u201cbroad societal consensus\u201d about how it should be used.\n\nThese principles were outlined in the world\u2019s first International Summit on Human Gene Editing, held in 2015, and they generally hew to other countries\u2019 laws on gene editing. In the U.S., Congress banned the use of federal money for experiments in gene editing on human embryos, and the FDA is banned from approving clinical trials that involve the same.\n\nNita Farahany, a bioethicist and director of the Duke Initiative for Science & Society, says that she isn\u2019t surprised to learn that a scientist has flouted global conventions to move forward with the gene editing of healthy embryos to create pregnancies and births.\n\nHowever, she, like Volberding, is surprised that HIV is the first application for germline gene editing, given the therapies already available to suppress virus levels and help people live long, healthy lives.\n\n\u201cYou would think the earliest application of CRISPR-cas9 for gene editing would be more fatal genetic variations,\u201d Farahany said, referring to the tool that allows scientists to cut out sections of a genome and replace them with something else. \u201cThings that cause great physical suffering or death in children,\u201d like infantile Tay-Sachs, a severe disease that can cause an infant to eventually lose their sight, hearing, and ability to move before causing their death around ages 4 or 5 years old.\n\nIn addition to the medical redundancy of He\u2019s experiment, experts also fear that his results might in fact perpetuate stigma against people with HIV, in a country where people already face severe consequences if others discover their HIV status.\n\nAnn Mongoven, associate director of Healthcare Ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, notes that the AP story that broke the news raises troubling questions about whether or not scientists leveraged HIV stigma to manipulate the parents into participating in the research.\n\nThe AP reports that of the seven couples who consented to do the experimental in vitro fertilization with He, all of the men had HIV, but they all had suppressed their levels of the virus with standard HIV medication. This suppression, combined with basic infection control measures like condom use throughout the pregnancy, would have prevented them from transmitting the virus to their partners and unborn children.\n\nStill, the article says that they wanted to participate in what He called an \u201cAIDS vaccine development\u201d program to protect their future children from \u201ca similar fate.\u201d It is not a given that a child with an HIV-positive parent will one day contract the virus themselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real question if whether the fear of AIDS and AIDS stigma became a way of recruiting parents into this research,\u201d she said.\n\nMongoven is worried that once news of the twins spreads, it could feed misperception about how HIV is passed on in the first place. There are about a half-million people living with HIV in China.\n\nNot The \u2018Best First Case\u2019\n\nBioethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University School of Medicine says that genetic engineering of human beings is inevitable, and that while there are fears that parents will create \u201cdesigner babies\u201d by prioritizing surface-level traits like eye color and height, scientists are primarily interested in the technology for disease prevention and treatment \u2015 much like He\u2019s experiment.\n\nEventually, he predicts, once gene editing becomes a reliable tool to help prevent disease and other undesirable traits, parents might actually be considered negligent if they chose not to use these tools.\n\n\u201cThere are many cultures in the world, including the U.S., that are highly competitive, market-driven societies where individuals are looking for their children in particular to get an edge and advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re not going to do gene editing when it gets close to enhancement or improvement, I find it silly and head-in-the-sand kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a recent Pew Survey of about 2,500 Americans finds that 72 percent think gene editing to treat a serious birth defect or disease is an appropriate use of the technology, while 60 percent say it\u2019s also appropriate to use the technology to reduce the risk of a serious disease that could appear over the course of a lifetime.\n\nBut until gene editing become safe and standardized, experts are clear about where the boundaries are. The experts we spoke to are profoundly disappointed that He\u2019s experiment was the first to demonstrate CRISPR-cas9\u2019s potential to the world.\n\nVolberding is excited about the promise that genetic editing holds for HIV \u2015 but only to cure people who already have the infection, not prevent it in healthy people. Farhany, too, thinks genetic editing holds great promise to alleviate human suffering \u2015 but only after a substantial body of animal and plant studies have proven it safe and effective."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "CDC Confirms 116 Cases Of Polio-Like AFM Illness In 31 States", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/acute-flaccid-myelitis-cases-rise_us_5bfd4990e4b0eb6d9313cc04", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "A mysterious polio-like illness that is sickening and in some cases paralyzing children is on the rise with at least 116 confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis so far this year, federal health officials said.\n\nThe latest number of confirmed AFM cases, spread across 31 states, is slightly more than double the number reported in October by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released its latest findings on Monday.\n\nAn additional 170 possible cases remain unconfirmed and under investigation, the CDC said.\n\nAFM is an extremely rare but serious neurological condition that causes the body\u2019s muscles and reflexes to become weak.

Doctors and other experts currently or formerly working in the region described a landscape that is not quite a war zone but in which shooting can break out almost anywhere for unknown reasons."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Chinese Scientist Claims to Use Crispr to Make First Genetically Edited Babies", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/gene-editing-babies-china.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-28 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Dr. He said the experiment worked for a couple whose twin girls were born in November.
