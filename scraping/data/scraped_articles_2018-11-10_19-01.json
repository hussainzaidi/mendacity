Rick Scott leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or about .15%. The spread in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, for a lead of .41%. In the narrowest contest, Democratic agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried's advantage stands at 5,326 votes \u2014 just .06% \u2014 over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nWith the margins in all three contests at under .5%, the votes will now be recounted by machine. That process must be finished by Thursday at 3 pm ET. Races within .25% will then go to a hand recount of overvotes and undervotes. An overvote means a voter selected more than the allotted options on the ballot; an undervote means a vote selected fewer than the available choices or, in these races, none. The Senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner both currently both fall within .25%.\n\nThe Senate race and the contest for agriculture commissioner both currently both fall within .25%.\n\nIn a statement after the unofficial count was made public, Scott's campaign called on Nelson to opt out of a recount, which is his option under state law.\n\n\"It's time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount,\" said Scott spokesman Chris Hartline.\n\nWhile the politicians tweeted and activists kicked off new protests this weekend, demonstrators on the streets outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office on Friday targeted Snipes, chanting \"lock her up\" and \"fake votes don't count\" as she and others worked inside trying to finish the initial vote count. \"Make America Great Again\" and \"Trump 2020\" signs and hats were also visible as a group carrying signs supporting Scott and DeSantis were met by another backing the Democrats, as nose-to-nose screaming matches nearly escalated into physical altercations.\n\nScott escalated already rising tensions across the state on Thursday night, when in a news conference he took a page from President Donald Trump and, without citing any evidence, accused \"left-wing activists in Broward County\" of trying to steal the election for Nelson. The county, in deep-blue portion of South Florida, is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted, Scott's lead had predictably diminished. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump picked up the thread and accused the Democrats of attempting \"Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\"\n\nBut Scott's request for an investigation into election-related fraud did not go far. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was told by the Department of State, which is run by a Republican Scott-appointee, that they had received \"no allegation of criminal activity.\" Still, Scott's campaign issued an ominous-sounding statement on Saturday morning \"encouraging every Florida Sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nelson's campaign filed suit against the state over its process for validating vote-by-mail ballots.\n\nDemocratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is running the Nelson recount effort, argued that Florida's signature matching process put an undue onus on the \"untrained opinions\" of poll workers, which led to a \"complete lack of uniformity\" in how the ballots were being judged.\n\n\"This serves as an outright disenfranchisement and burden on the right to vote,\" Elias told reporters on a call Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has also injected himself into the fight, alleging on Thursday and Friday -- like Scott and the President, with no proof -- that there are \"shenanigans going on in Broward and Palm Beach\" before suggesting that a sinister cabal of liberals from Washington was at work trying to rig the election. In fact, out-of-state lawyers from both parties, including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago, have been flocking to Florida ahead of the recount.\n\nLeading a call for Scott's campaign on Saturday, Graham touted Scott's legal team and again skewered Broward and Palm Beach election officials for their lack of transparency.\n\n\"Rick has a good team of lawyers,\" Graham said. \"Lawyers are not going to decide this race, the voters will. I support every valid vote being counted. But I also support the rule of law when it comes to voting.\"\n\nAround the state on Friday, allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns, lawyers, operatives and freelance rabble-rousers girded themselves for a re-run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nOutside a mail distribution center in Miami-Dade County, a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor. Later in the day, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Service said it was \"researching the matter to verify that all ballots have been handled in accordance to USPS service standards.\"\n\nDetailed updates on the state of the race had been hard to come by ahead of Sunday's noon reporting deadline, leading Scott to successfully sue top election officials in Broward and Palm Beach Counties for information on the total votes cast and how many of them had been canvassed.\n\nIn Broward, Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes turned over information to Scott and his team for review late Friday. But before midnight, the campaign pushed out a new press release claiming Snipes had not fully complied with the court order \"because she refuses to confirm whether or not additional ballots exist that must be counted.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Gov.

She is a progressive black woman running for governor against a conservative white man in a deep-red state that Trump won handily in 2016.\n\nBut the truth is: Her campaign was so good, and she is so compelling, that Abrams would almost certainly be governor-elect right now -- if the election had been fair.\n\nAs the final votes are tallied, Kemp enjoys a razor-thin margin -- but it is the product of misconduct so brazen and unethical that UN monitors would likely declare a stolen election if the contest were held in another country.\n\nThat's why, right now, every voter in Georgia should be logging onto the secretary of state website or calling Election Protection at 1-866-OUR-VOTE to ensure their votes were counted. Those who cast a provisional ballot should head to their county election office immediately, bringing a ballot receipt and driver's license/ID or proof of citizenship. The deadline is today, Friday, November 9; the time varies by county. (You can learn more at www.GoVoteGA.org ).\n\nIf this assessment sounds extreme -- take a look at the top eight things Kemp did to steal the election:\n\nOverseeing the election he ran in: Kemp supervised and monitored his own gubernatorial election as Georgia's secretary of state and refused to step down until Kemp supervised and monitored his own gubernatorial election as Georgia's secretary of state and refused to step down until two days after the polls closed. He ignored former US President and Georgia native Jimmy Carter , who urged Kemp to foster voter confidence and avoid any risk of bias by resigning.\n\nPurging voters from the rolls: Under Kemp,\n\nClosing polling places: Georgia shut down : Under Kemp, Georgia eliminated 1.5 million people from voter rolls between 2012 to 2016 -- nearly 10.6 percent of the total -- in part through an \"exact match\" standard that deleted people if so much as a comma was out of place.Georgia shut down 214 polling places across the state, mainly in areas with higher poverty rates and significant populations of people of color.\n\nDisenfranchising voters: Between 2013 and 2015, the state cited its \"exact match\" protocol and canceled nearly 35,000 voter registration applications (76 percent were from applicants who identified as African-American, Latino or Asian-American), according to Between 2013 and 2015, the state cited its \"exact match\" protocol and canceled nearly 35,000 voter registration applications (76 percent were from applicants who identified as African-American, Latino or Asian-American), according to a lawsuit against Kemp filed by a coalition of civil rights groups.\n\nSowing voter confusion: Days after the midterm voter registration deadline in Georgia passed, 53,000 voting applications were still pending, the Associated Press reported. An Days after the midterm voter registration deadline in Georgia passed, 53,000 voting applications were still pending, the Associated Press reported. An AP analysis found that 70% of the applications were from black Georgians.\n\nCreating long lines with too few voting machines: Voters, many in areas with significant minority populations, waited an average of three hours to cast their votes on November 6, a representative from the nonpartisan organization Verified Voting told Voters, many in areas with significant minority populations, waited an average of three hours to cast their votes on November 6, a representative from the nonpartisan organization Verified Voting told Wired . Some voters waited for hours because Kemp's office did not provide power cords for voter machines. Thousands of voters waited at precincts with only three voting machines -- and now, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Kemp's office had hundreds of unused voting machines sitting in a warehouse.\n\nForcing voters to use provisional ballots: The combination of voter roll purges and strict voter ID laws (Brian Kemp himself was initially The combination of voter roll purges and strict voter ID laws (Brian Kemp himself was initially turned away from the polls on Tuesday) forced many eligible voters to use provisional paper ballots. Many of these have not yet been counted\n\nRefusing to secure elections: Georgia is Georgia is one of a handful of states that runs its elections using direct recording electronic machines without keeping a paper trail of votes. Kemp repeatedly ignored warnings and fought legal efforts to force him to secure the vote and create a paper trail, all while accusing Democrats of trying to hack the state's voter registration files.\n\nIt is hard not to conclude that Kemp is either incompetent at running elections -- or thought the only way he could win would be to cheat.\n\nJUST WATCHED 11 House, 2 Senate races yet to be called Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 11 House, 2 Senate races yet to be called 05:40\n\nYet despite it all, Stacey Abrams is quite nearly within the range to force a runoff election on December 4. Under Georgia law, a candidate for governor must secure 50% of the vote.\n\nIf none of the above had occurred, Abrams almost certainly would have won outright or held Kemp under that level. As it is, there may be sufficient votes yet uncounted to force a runoff. Voters in Georgia deserve for there to be a runoff so they know their next governor was fairly and legitimately elected.\n\nKemp has tried to distract us by stepping down as secretary of state immediately after the damage was done. He has even declared victory, even though there remain uncounted votes. Worse, the secretary of state's office is not cooperating with the Abrams campaign to determine how many.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

On Wednesday, Chinese dissident writer Ma Jian, who is based in London, said that an event he was due to speak at in the city had been canceled by the venue.\n\nMa was scheduled to host two talks Saturday at Tai Kwun, an art space which has received government funding, as part of the events of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Part of the talk was to focus on his new book, \"China Dream.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Ma tweeted: \"Just been told that my two events at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival this week can no longer be held at Tai Kwun, where all the other events are taking place. An alternative venue will have to be found. No reason has been given to me yet.\"\n\nJust been told that my two events at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival this week can no longer be held at Tai Kwun, where all the other events are taking place.

I'm a novelist, not an activist, and am attending the Festival to discuss my new novel, China Dream. My 'politics' are simple: I believe in free thought and free speech. Without them, life has no meaning. \u2014 \u9a6c\u5efa Ma Jian (@majian53) November 8, 2018\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Director of Tai Kwun Timothy Calnin said organizers \"do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\"\n\n\"The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,\" said Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, a pro-free speech organization.\n\n\"It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity,\" added Ng.\n\nA second replacement venue which had stepped in to host the event has also pulled out, according to Hong Kong Free Press. There's no mention of the venue on the Hong Kong Literary Festival web page promoting the Ma Jian talk.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ma will be allowed entry in the city. Writing on Twitter Thursday, Ma said that he remained \"determined to go\" to the city despite concerns that he would be turned away by immigration officials on arrival. \"It is precisely at times such as this when free speech is under threat that writers have a duty to speak out,\" he added.\n\nLast week, another Chinese dissident decided against traveling to Hong Kong amid heightened safety fears.\n\nArtist Badiucao had been due to present a new work at an event that was itself later canceled , following alleged threats made to the organizers.\n\nPosters of Chinese President Xi Jinping by dissident artist Badiucao.\n\n\"We are sorry to announce that the exhibition 'Gongle,' by Chinese artist Badiucao, has been canceled,\" the Hong Kong Free Press, a local publication which was co-sponsoring the event, said in a statement.\n\n\"The decision follows threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist. Whilst the organizers value freedom of expression, the safety of our partners remains a major concern.\"\n\nHong Kong police said that anyone with safety concerns should contact them, but would not comment on the individual case. Representatives of the Chinese government in Hong Kong also did not comment.\n\nTaken together, Mallet, Ma and Badiucao's experiences have raised severe concerns about Hong Kong's ongoing commitment to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, both of which are enshrined in its de facto constitution but heavily limited in mainland China.\n\n\"To deny Mallet his work after hosting Andy Chan from the HKNP at the FCC and expelling him from Hong Kong was ridiculous enough, and a grave infringement of press freedom in itself,\" democracy activist Joshua Wong said Friday.\n\n\"Banning him from the city altogether, even as a tourist, is nothing less than an authoritarian attempt to censor all opposing voices. This development is extremely worrying, especially for journalists sent to this city to report on Hong Kong and Chinese political situations. I hope that the international community can now see the severity of the situation of freedom in Hong Kong, and try to protect the rights of their own citizens here,\" added Wong."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Deadly wildfire destroys Paradise, California", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/2k3QuBdW3VQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the wildfire raged nearby, Whitney Vaughan and her husband had just enough time to grab a laundry basket of dirty clothes and some pictures before fleeing their home in Paradise, California.\n\nVaughan could hear screams and explosions nearby Thursday as she and her husband got in their car and drove away.

Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.\n\nThe Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock.\n\n\"There's really not much left.

She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThey drove away but got eventually got caught in traffic. Flames were feet away, smoke was thick, cars weren't moving and people were panicking. Some people left their cars there \"and took off running, carrying their babies and kids.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook. She and her husband eventually were able to drive away safely.\n\n\"We thought the fire was going to kill us,\" she told CNN.\n\nParadise, roughly 80 miles north of Sacramento, is where four people were found dead in different vehicles and one person was found dead near a vehicle on the road where Vaughn recorded her video.

The county, in deep-blue portion of South Florida, is notoriously slow in counting its votes and as its tally mounted, Scott's lead had predictably diminished. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump picked up the thread and accused the Democrats of attempting \"Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\"\n\nBut Scott's request for an investigation into election-related fraud did not go far. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was told by the Department of State, which is run by a Republican Scott-appointee, that they had received \"no allegation of criminal activity.\" Still, Scott's campaign issued an ominous-sounding statement on Saturday morning \"encouraging every Florida Sheriff to watch for any violations and take appropriate action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nelson's campaign filed suit against the state over its process for validating vote-by-mail ballots.\n\nDemocratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is running the Nelson recount effort, argued that Florida's signature matching process put an undue onus on the \"untrained opinions\" of poll workers, which led to a \"complete lack of uniformity\" in how the ballots were being judged.\n\n\"This serves as an outright disenfranchisement and burden on the right to vote,\" Elias told reporters on a call Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has also injected himself into the fight, alleging on Thursday and Friday -- like Scott and the President, with no proof -- that there are \"shenanigans going on in Broward and Palm Beach\" before suggesting that a sinister cabal of liberals from Washington was at work trying to rig the election. In fact, out-of-state lawyers from both parties, including a handful who had significant roles 18 years ago, have been flocking to Florida ahead of the recount.\n\nLeading a call for Scott's campaign on Saturday, Graham touted Scott's legal team and again skewered Broward and Palm Beach election officials for their lack of transparency.\n\n\"Rick has a good team of lawyers,\" Graham said. \"Lawyers are not going to decide this race, the voters will. I support every valid vote being counted. But I also support the rule of law when it comes to voting.\"\n\nAround the state on Friday, allegations and rumors of misplaced or lost votes fueled simmering anger and confusion as the campaigns, lawyers, operatives and freelance rabble-rousers girded themselves for a re-run of the pitched partisan combat that took over the state during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nOutside a mail distribution center in Miami-Dade County, a group of activists with images they said showed undelivered ballots inside tried and failed to get a meeting with a supervisor.

(The court cited security concerns .)\n\nKavanaugh also seems inclined against a prominent role at next week's annual meeting of the Federalist Society, the group working with the White House to confirm conservative judges, to which Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first appointee, gave a rousing keynote speech last year.\n\nWithin the court, Kavanaugh has deferred to his colleagues in oral arguments and quickly adhered to the court's institutional traditions. The other justices have gone out of their way to be publicly welcoming and have shown an unusual degree of collegiality all around during arguments so far this term, even laughing more at one another's jokes.\n\nIn the few cases he has handled so far, Kavanaugh has declined some opportunities to favor the Trump administration, separating himself from Gorsuch in early votes. He has aligned more with Chief Justice John Roberts than the far right of the bench.\n\nAll told, Kavanaugh appears to be lying low after the volatile confirmation process and buttressing Roberts' efforts to move the court away from the white-hot media spotlight.\n\nYet Kavanaugh, a political insider who spent 12 years on a US appeals court, also understands that the media scrutiny will fade. The record of Kavanaugh, 53 and appointed for life, will become clear only over many months and years.\n\nFor the law in America, the newest of the nine represents only part of a momentous change underway. For years as the justices met privately to decide cases in a rich oak-paneled conference room, the person whose views mattered most was Justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded.\n\nA conservative with centrist tendencies on social issues -- including abortion, race and gay rights -- Kennedy was regularly the deciding vote. Like the lawyers who stood at the lectern and publicly argued before the high court, individual justices often tailored their arguments around the private conference table to Kennedy.\n\nNot one of the current nine has a similar centrist approach. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide are watching Kavanaugh for any clues about how to best approach the new justice.\n\nKavanaugh was carefully vetted by a Trump team that did not want a vacillating jurist in the mode of Kennedy.\n\nGorsuch has fulfilled those expectations , often partnering on the far right with Justice Clarence Thomas for an originalist approach to the law, tied to the Constitution's 18th-century origins.\n\nKavanaugh's style is different and he appears to be trying to make good on his oft-repeated confirmation mantra about \"always being a team player on the team of nine.\"\n\nWhere Gorsuch immediately opted against having his clerks join the clerk pool that collectively screens petitions for certiorari, seeking review of cases lost in lower courts, Kavanaugh has had his clerks join. (All justices but Gorsuch and Samuel Alito are in the so-called cert pool, which dates to the 1970s.)\n\nIn the private conference, the junior justice has the responsibility of taking notes on the proceedings and answering the door if any aide knocks to offer a document or even a fetched set of forgotten reading glasses or a coffee cup requested by a justice.\n\nThat person is now Kavanaugh. He will also be last in line to cast his vote. In tight cases, he likely would be the fifth conservative, sealing a victory for the right wing. Or he may prove unpredictable, perhaps even defying his benefactor.\n\nBefore this week's midterm elections, as Trump tried to rally Republicans, he constantly invoked Kavanaugh's appointment and the Democratic opposition he faced. The day after the election, the President boasted that the Kavanaugh strategy paid off.\n\n\"By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings,\" Trump said at a White House news conference.\n\n\"Tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Voter: Kavanaugh hearing was 'embarrassing' 05:29\n\nPlaying nice in public\n\nKavanaugh's response to the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford prompted some lawyers and judges, including retired Justice John Paul Stevens, to question his temperament and ability to be an impartial jurist.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Kavanaugh described Ford's claims as part of \"a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election ... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\"\n\nIndividual justices are conflicted over how Kavanaugh's confirmation unfolded, yet all have an incentive to be collegial and forward-looking. They have projected a \"business as usual\" image, even appearing to be getting along better on the bench.\n\nKavanaugh has now sat through three weeks of oral arguments. He has held back and let his colleagues air their queries before jumping in. He also has tried to take opportunities to question both sides in fractious cases, perhaps to avoid being labeled with a predictably conservative approach.\n\nFellow justices have shown regard for his questioning, occasionally picking up on his line of inquiry.\n\n\"What the treaty seems to prevent,\" Justice Elena Kagan observed to a lawyer at the lectern in one case, \"is the state from taking either travel or, as Justice Kavanaugh says, travel with goods.\"\n\nAt another point, Kagan, who sits next to Kavanaugh on the bench, said, \"I think the import of Justice Kavanaugh's question is that in the usual case. ... \"\n\nIn a separate dispute, after Kavanaugh had tried to enter the fray but was interrupted, Roberts stopped the lawyer at the lectern. \"I think Justice Kavanaugh had a question,\" Roberts said, ensuring Kavanaugh an opening.\n\nLater in the same argument, Kavanaugh said, \"to pick up on the chief justice's comments. ... \"\n\nJUST WATCHED Chief Justice: We speak for the Constitution Replay More Videos ...

Roberts may end up inching to the left himself in some cases, to avoid some 5-4 splits, and may find a new ally in Kavanaugh.\n\nHow those justices on the right band together -- or not -- could make a difference in the cases the court takes up and the fate of long-standing precedents, for example on abortion rights. Where Kavanaugh falls on the ideological spectrum could also affect larger constitutional dilemmas, provoked by Trump's demonstrated disregard for legal norms.\n\nKavanaugh and Roberts, a decade older at 63, have known each other for nearly 30 years. Both served in the US Solicitor General's Office during the George H.W. Bush administration, Roberts as a deputy SG and Kavanaugh on a fellowship for young lawyers. During the George W. Bush administration, Kavanaugh obtained top legal jobs and Roberts won court appointments, first to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in 2003, and then to the Supreme Court, in 2005.\n\nKavanaugh himself then served on the DC Circuit, reinforcing their common path. They have long had a friendly relationship.\n\nLast month, when Kavanaugh underwent a ceremonial investiture at the White House, following his 50-48 confirmation vote by the Senate, he went out of his way to praise Roberts.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary,\" Kavanaugh said. \"As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.\"\n\nRoberts returned the favorable comments when he spoke of judicial independence, after referring to \"the contentious events in Washington,\" at the University of Minnesota the following week.\n\n\"As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation,\" Roberts said.\n\nNot siding with Trump -- yet\n\nThe 2018-19 session, which began a week before Kavanaugh was seated last month, is still so new that he and most justices have yet to issue any written opinions. But Kavanaugh has taken actions that separate him from the conservative stalwarts.\n\nIn late October, when the court took up a challenge to the Commerce Department's addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, Kavanaugh was with the majority in allowing lower court proceedings to continue and testimony to be taken from a key Justice Department lawyer in the dispute, while his fellow conservatives Gorsuch and Thomas dissented. (Separately, the full court blocked the challengers from obtaining testimony from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.)\n\nA week later, on November 2, the court by a 6-3 vote rejected a subsequent administration request to postpone the trial . Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch publicly dissented, but Kavanaugh, who may have been predicted to join them, did not.\n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court -- again over public dissents from Thomas and Gorsuch -- rejected a Trump administration request to block a lawsuit by youths who want to hold the government responsible for emissions policy and climate change.\n\nIn none of those three matters did Kavanaugh write anything that became public.\n\nTrump had no public comment on any of them, either. The President still speaks enthusiastically of his new nominee and suggests he believes the high court will be more on his side.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a decision that blocked the administration from ending an Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the United States when young from deportation, Trump said he would be happy to take the case to the nine.\n\n\"We want to be in the Supreme Court on DACA,\" Trump told reporters Friday morning, later adding, \"where we'll be given a fair decision.\"\n\nAnd earlier in the week, before Tuesday's elections, the President raised Kavanaugh's name to rally campaign crowds. He cast Kavanaugh as a victim of false accusers and their Democratic enablers.\n\n\"False accusations. False accusations,\" Trump said. \"They want to ruin a man or a woman.

It has also created new controversies, with legal experts debating about the legality of the appointment and news stories featuring his past criticisms of Mueller and defense of Trump.\n\nThe transformation of Sessions from influential early backer of Trump's improbable presidential campaign to frequent target of the President's scorn is a study in the fickleness of political alliances in Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorney general received the call everyone in Washington knew was coming some day soon.\n\nJohn Kelly, the White House chief of staff, asked Sessions to submit his resignation, according to multiple sources briefed on the call. Sessions agreed to comply, but he wanted a few more days before the resignation would become effective. Kelly said he'd consult the President.\n\nSoon, the sources say, top Justice officials convened on the 5th floor suite of offices for the attorney general. Eventually, there were two huddles in separate offices. Among those in Sessions' office was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, his deputy Ed O'Callaghan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nA few yards away, Whitaker strategized with other aides, including Gary Barnett, now his chief of staff.\n\nThe rival huddles, which haven't been previously reported, laid bare a break in the relationship between Sessions and Whitaker that had emerged in recent weeks, after it became clear that Whitaker played a behind-the-scenes role in an aborted effort to oust Rosenstein.\n\nA source close to Sessions says that the former attorney general realized that Whitaker was \"self-dealing\" after reports surfaced in September that Whitaker had spoken with Kelly and had discussed plans to become the No. 2 at the Justice Department if Rosenstein was forced to resign.\n\nIn recent months, with his relationship with the President at a new low, Sessions skipped several so-called principals meetings that he was slated to attend as a key member of the Cabinet. A source close to Sessions says that neither the attorney general nor Trump thought it was a good idea for Sessions to be at the White House, so he sent surrogates. Whitaker was one of them.\n\nBut Sessions did not realize Whitaker was having conversations with the White House about his future until the news broke in late September about Rosenstein.\n\nOn Wednesday as aides began drafting Sessions' resignation letter, the distrust for Whitaker burst into the open.\n\nThe fact that Whitaker would become acting attorney general, passing over Rosenstein suddenly raised concerns about the impact on the most high-profile investigation in the Justice Department, the Russia probe led by Mueller. The Mueller probe has been at the center of Trump's ire directed at Sessions and the Justice Department. Whitaker has made comments criticizing Mueller's investigation and Rosenstein's oversight of it, and has questioned the allegations of Russian interference.\n\nRosenstein and O'Callaghan, the highest-ranked officials handling day-to-day oversight of Mueller's investigation, urged Sessions to delay the effective date of his resignation.\n\nSoon, Whitaker strode into Sessions' office and asked to speak one-on-one to the attorney general; the others left the two men alone. It was a brief conversation. Shortly after, Sessions told his huddle that his resignation would be effective that day.\n\nO'Callaghan had tried to appeal to Sessions, noting that he hadn't heard back about whether the President would allow a delay. At least one Justice official in the room mentioned that there would be legal questions about whether Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general is constitutional. Someone also reminded Sessions that the last time Whitaker played a role in a purported resignation -- a few weeks earlier in September, with Rosenstein -- the plan collapsed.\n\nSessions never heard in person from the President -- the man who gained television fame for his catch-phrase \"You're fired\" doesn't actually like such confrontation and prefers to have others do the firing, people close to the President say.

Sessions liked him, but even if he didn't, the plan was already hatched for him to take the role, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nLeonard Leo, the influential executive vice president of the Federalist Society, recommended to then-White House counsel Don McGahn that Whitaker would make a good chief of staff for Sessions.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo said Friday.\n\n\"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department,\" he added. \"Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager.

He convened a late afternoon meeting with senior department officials. He kept remarks brief, saying he was proud to lead them, that they've been doing good work and to keep doing what they're doing. Another call, also brief, with US attorneys around the country followed.\n\nOn Friday, he sent his first department-wide message, thanking Sessions for his service and extolling the work of colleagues around the country. \"As we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nSessions' last day\n\nThe ignominious end to Sessions' tenure is a far cry from the early days of the 2016 campaign, when he became an eager surrogate. Sessions' hardline views on immigration became suffused in the rhetoric that Trump adopted.\n\nSessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump at a time when establishment Republicans were still staying away, and he left his safe Alabama Senate seat to take the attorney general job.\n\nSeveral members of his staff also joined the President's team, helping to craft some of the harsh immigration policies that Sessions often preached from Capitol Hill and which have become a cornerstone of stump speeches that Trump regularly uses to excite his political base.\n\nBut months into the job, Trump had soured on Sessions for the sin of recusing himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible connections to the Trump campaign.\n\nMore recently, Sessions appeared at peace with the prospect of being ousted from office.

Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "FDA plans to launch new restrictions on e-cigarette flavors", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sautk1x1bCQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Taking on epidemic levels of teen e-cigarette use, the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce new restrictions on the sale of e-cigarette products an agency official confirmed Thursday.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as next week.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors share gun stories, demand action after NRA tells them to 'stay in their lane'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DpMBghpNdxY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

It's a higher rate for the 50 largest metropolitan areas combined, with 4.9 people per 100,000 killed by a gun. This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this?

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46142276", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:00:50", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year\n\nThe way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck \"in the 18th Century\", leading doctors say.\n\nEvery year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled.\n\nIt said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money.\n\nThe RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations.\n\nGetting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help.\n\nIt said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done.\n\nDr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: \"It's an 18th Century system.

I put my hands to my head and I was drenched in sweat. I knew straight away it was a heart attack,\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\nShe was a healthy 38-year-old when she had a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), a rare and often undiagnosed condition.\n\nIt is the leading cause of heart attacks in women of childbearing age, affecting around 1,000 women a year.\n\nIt occurs when there is a sudden tear in one of the coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart.\n\nIn hospital, Hayley, from Congleton in Cheshire, feared the worst.\n\n\"I can remember saying to them, 'am I dying?' And they just kept saying, 'we've tried everything we can, but nothing is working,'\" she said.\n\n'I felt less of a woman'\n\nShe survived, but like many women with SCAD, was told pregnancy would mean the risk of another heart attack.\n\n\"I think it was another thing that was stolen from me, so I almost don't allow myself to think about it, because it could take you down a dark path of sadness,\" Hayley reflected.\n\n\"I felt less of a person, less of a woman, more of a failure, like I was faulty.\"\n\nWhat is SCAD?\n\nSpontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an under-diagnosed heart condition\n\nIt affects mainly women, occasionally during - or soon after - pregnancy\n\nMenopause, extreme stress and exercise have also been associated with it\n\nDuring an attack, a sudden tear or bruise develops in one of the coronary arteries blocking the blood follow\n\nIt can cause death, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and require heart bypass surgery\n\nSource: Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit\n\nPatient's decision\n\nHayley is the kind of woman who consultant cardiologist Dr Abi Al-Hussaini is trying to help, with her clinic at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.\n\nImage caption Dr Al-Hussaini aims to allow women to make an informed decision on whether to have a baby.\n\nDr Al-Hussaini assesses the damage done to the heart by the SCAD and reviews the patient's medication, generally lowering the amount they are on.\n\nShe uses that information to advise the patient how risky a pregnancy could be.\n\nThis does mean sometimes she has to advise that the risk to health might be very high, but the key is the patient makes the decision, rather than the usual blanket advice not to get pregnant.\n\nIf one of her patients decides to proceed, they are referred to the pre-existing \"high risk pregnancy team\" at the hospital, who monitor them throughout the pregnancy.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of patients over the last few years who have come to me unhappy that they have been told they cannot have a child ever again,\" she explained.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I established the clinic, to give these patients the correct advice and allow them to make an informed decision themselves.\"\n\nShe believes a lack of research into the condition is why most cardiologists prefer the blanket advice.\n\nSharp pain\n\nOne of the first women helped by the clinic was Julie Murphy, 40, from Ruislip.\n\nImage caption Julie Murphy and Holly play with baby Bella, who was born in April\n\nShortly before her honeymoon in 2013, she started to feel unwell, like she had flu. While on holiday in Kenya, the symptoms got worse.\n\nThen, while swimming, she had a sharp pain in her chest. When she got home, she had tests on her heart and, \"the next day I found out I'd had a heart attack\".\n\nThe days and weeks that followed were very tough.\n\n\"All the medication I was on really slowed me down so I couldn't even walk up the stairs when I came home from hospital.

But she became part of a research project led by Dr Al-Hussaini and had her first daughter, Holly, in 2015.\n\n'Awesome team'\n\nShe then became one of the clinic's first patients when she became pregnant for a second time.\n\n\"I was worried that they would say there's no possibility or it would be too dangerous for us to try to have a baby, that it might mean that I'm putting my life at risk,\" she said.\n\nBella was born in April.\n\n\"They're such an awesome team that you felt so looked after,\" Julie said.\n\nDespite the hope she is giving patients, Dr Al-Hussaini says she has encountered resistance from doctors around the world, in terms of what advice they give their patients.\n\n\"In America, they are against becoming pregnant any time after a heart attack, or having had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection,\" she said.\n\n\"But again, I think that's because there hasn't been a huge amount of research - but there is a growing amount of research at the moment that's been developed.\"\n\nFollow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Epilepsy: 'I'm not daydreaming Miss, I'm having a seizure'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46099603", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Olivia was diagnosed with absence seizures at the age of 11\n\n\"When I was younger my teachers thought I was naughty and 'away with the fairies'.

While they remain threatened they have done well in places such as Cantabria in northern Spain where their numbers have almost doubled in ten years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolf sightings have increased in Germany and France in recent years\n\nBut conservation success is also increasing the chances of human-wildlife conflict.\n\nWolf numbers have increased in Germany to such an extent that the animals now roam into the Netherlands where they have been linked to an increase in attacks on sheep.\n\nDespite these wild carnivores being protected by law in most countries, that hasn't stopped farmers reaching for their guns when their domestic animals have been attacked.\n\nThis has become a significant issue in some countries. In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears. The farmers will also be entitled to compensation for building electric fences and buying guard dogs.\n\nIndirect expenses, including veterinary bills for the treatment of wounded sheep or cattle, and the costs of searching for missing animals, will also be fully met.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners welcomed the move.\n\n\"It's taking away an excuse for killing the animals by saying there are preventative measures you can take which can reduce, if not completely eliminate the threat,\" said Dr Jo Swabe from Humane Society International.\n\n\"We hope it will make a difference on the ground.\"\n\nImage copyright NurPhoto Image caption French farmers have held protests against plans to allow wolf numbers to increase\n\nThere has been a lot of pressure from governments in Germany and France to allow culls of wolves as a way of protecting domestic livestock. And some have raised concerns that humans could also be attacked.\n\n\"You have essentially scaremongering politicians saying we need to have this option because sometimes it could be a child that's attacked,\" said Dr Swabe.\n\n\"But if you look at wolf behaviour, it's highly unlikely that a child would ever be attacked. They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments. Experts say that in Romania, for example, payments for damage caused by large carnivore attacks have been withheld.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "ExoMars: Life-detecting robot to be sent to Oxia Planum", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153332", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption ExoMars: A copy of the rover undergoing testing\n\nThe robot rover that Europe and Russia will send to Mars in 2020 will be targeted at a near-equatorial site on the Red Planet known as Oxia Planum.\n\nThe area was recommended by an expert panel meeting at Leicester University.\n\nOxia is rich in clays and other minerals that have resulted from prolonged rock interactions with water.\n\nThe ExoMars vehicle will carry a drill and sophisticated instruments to this ancient terrain to look for signs of past or even present life.\n\nTechnically, Oxia remains just a recommendation at this stage; it still needs to be signed off by the heads of the European and Russian space agencies.\n\nBut it is hard to see the considered view of the Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG) being overturned.\n\nImage copyright IRSPS/TAS; NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State Universi Image caption Oxia Planum: The landing possibilities have been studied for more than four years\n\nThe two-day gathering in Leicester was informed by specialists in Mars geology, and engineers whose chief concern was identifying a location that minimised the risks of landing.\n\nGetting down safely to the surface of the Red Planet is notoriously difficult. More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Unofficial Florida Vote Tallies Submitted to State Election Officials", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/unofficial-florida-vote-tallies-submitted-to-state-election-officials/4653074.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Florida election officials are expected to announce soon whether hotly-contested midterm election races for the U.S. Senate and governor will be subject to recounts after unofficial tallies were submitted Saturday.\n\nThe contentious U.S. Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has Scott ahead by about 15,000 votes, a lead of less than 0.25 percent.\n\nThe governor's race between Republican former congressman Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has DeSantis leading by almost 36,000 votes, or about 0.4 percent.\n\nFlorida law requires a statewide machine recount when the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent and a manual recount if the margin is less than 0.25 percent.\n\n\n\nUnofficial vote counts from county canvassing boards were due to be submitted by midday Saturday.

It toppled centuries-old monarchies and established new states out of the ashes of the dead empires.\n\n\u200bSelf-determination, in theory and practice\n\nImmediately after the war ended, said Georgetown University history professor Aviel Roshwald, it looked as if a new era had dawned in which nations could claim their fates and determine their futures.\n\n\"In the immediate term of 1918-19, it looked as though the advocates of self-determination of the smaller peoples of Europe had won, as the big multinational empires like the Hapsburg empire, the Romanov empire, in the Middle East the Ottoman empire, either collapsed, were conquered or both, and gave way to new entities,\" he said.\n\n\u201cBut each of those emergent or enlarged new nation-states that emerged from the rubble of empires was born in conditions of international chaos, economic disruption born of war, and their ostensible victories already carried in them the makings of future conflicts and future defeats.\"\n\nThough victorious, the newly minted countries were far from peaceful or stable. Their very sovereignty was being challenged from the start by the ethnic minorities they incorporated inside their new borders. It was a hard lesson in the shortcomings of self-determination, Roshwald said.\n\n\"Self-determination does not offer a solution to ethnic problems; it's a formula that raises questions that can only be solved \u2014 all too often have been solved \u2014 through massive violence,\" he said.\n\nHistorian John Lampe, global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said that when then-President Woodrow Wilson proposed his Fourteen Points that would inspire the creation of the League of Nations, self-determination is not what he had in mind, especially not in the way it has been interpreted through the years.\n\n\"It's a phrase that's been much used,\" Lampe said. \"If self-determination means a constitutional government, a chance for all of the citizens to vote, that's one thing, that's fine. If it means self-determination for our ethnic group alone, then obviously it's not a recipe for success.\"\n\nAlienation of ethnic minorities\n\nPostwar Europe proved this well. As the victors claimed their territories and doled out punishments on the defeated nations, waves of ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses followed, deepening hostilities and polarizing the affected populations.\n\n\"The result was an almost immediate alienation of the large ethnic minorities that each of these states incorporated within their territories,\" said Roshwald. \"Had there been a greater willingness to grant meaningful autonomy to regionally based minorities, perhaps some of these conflicts could have been defused.\"\n\nThe historian said these postwar traumatic events allowed for radical ideologies to take hold and dictate world events for ensuing decades.\n\nWithout the violent disruption of World War I, he said, \"the kind of radicalization and polarization that we associate with communism \u2014 and of course at the other end of the spectrum with Nazism and fascism \u2014 it's hard to imagine those emerging from the fringes of the political spectrum to become central factors in European and global history the way they did.\"\n\nLIke many other historians, Lampe sees a direct link between the abuses and recriminations that followed World War I and the even deadlier war that followed.\n\n\"This Second World War \u2026 is very much a settling of scores from the First World War that Hitler can play on,\" Lampe said. \"Also, the Bolshevik party would not have come to power in Russia without the First World War and the strains imposed there.\"\n\nNeed for tolerance, respect, dialogue\n\nRoshwald says the concept of self-determination for nations poses more questions than it solves in today's world of mixed populations and shifting identities. And when it results in redrawn borders, it often produces more upheaval.\n\n\"In all too many cases, changes of borders create new sources of recrimination and irredentist claims in later years,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe historians said the lessons learned from the two world wars are enshrined today in powerful trans-Atlantic organizations designed to facilitate cooperation and dialogue among Western powers.\n\n\n\nWATCH: John Lampe: Learning the Lessons of World War II\n\nSuch connections have enabled Germany and France \u2014 bitter enemies in the two world wars \u2014 to sit today as allies at the helm of the European Union.\n\nThe lessons include a greater understanding of the need for tolerance, the rule of law, compromise and dialogue, along with respect for the rights of others.

Bush.\n\nTrump\u2019s choice of Whitaker to take the helm of the Justice Department and oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election sparked a pushback from congressional Democrats and even some prominent Republicans.\n\n'A great guy'\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion that he doesn\u2019t know Whitaker directly contradicts what he told Fox News last month, when he said, \u201cI mean, I know Matt Whitaker\u201d and that he is \u201ca great guy.\u201d CNN also reported that Whitaker has visited the White House a dozen or more times since becoming Sessions\u2019 chief of staff and that he had a good relationship with the president.\n\nThe White House doesn\u2019t release lists of visitors. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the number of times Whitaker has met with and briefed Trump or members of his administration.\n\nWhitaker's future at the helm of the department, however, appeared in doubt, with several other candidates under consideration for the permanent top job.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted Friday that a permanent replacement could be named soon for Whitaker, a conservative activist who has frequently voiced skepticism about Mueller\u2019s probe and insisted there was no evidence of collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign officials and the Russians.\n\n\u201cI think this will be a very interim AG (attorney general),\u201d McConnell said.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t revealed who he has in mind for the top job but nearly a dozen prospective candidates' names have cropped up in recent days, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, outgoing Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nJohn Malcolm, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group with close ties to the White House, said it's possible Trump will nominate Whitaker for the top post if he \u201cdoes a really great job\u201d as acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment came after Trump forced out Sessions following months of complaining about the attorney general\u2019s decision, just weeks into office, to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia probe. Trump blamed the recusal for Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nMueller investigation\n\nBecause Sessions had recused himself, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein supervised Mueller\u2019s investigation. Now, the task has fallen to Whitaker, and Democrats are demanding that he, too, should recuse himself because of his past criticism of the Mueller investigation. Whitaker\u2019s defenders, though, say there is no reason for him to step aside.\n\nWhitaker was appointed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law that allows the president to appoint any senior government official as acting head of an agency for up to 210 days. But some constitutional scholars have questioned the legality of the appointment, citing a constitutional requirement that the attorney general must be approved by the Senate.\n\nBrenna Bird, a Republican county prosecutor in Iowa who worked at Whitaker\u2019s former law firm, praised Whitaker as a \u201chighly respected\u201d former U.S. attorney who has earned the president\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cObviously, the president has a great deal of trust in him to put him in charge at this time,\u201d Bird said. \u201cAnd I know he\u2019s met with the president along with the former attorney general several times as well. I don\u2019t think President Trump would choose him for this job if he didn\u2019t think he was up to it, and he is.\u201d\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Vote Tallies Due in Florida\u2019s Tight Senate, Governor Races", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/vote-tallies-due-in-florida-tight-senate-governor-races/4652759.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Unofficial vote tallies in Florida\u2019s elections were due by midday Saturday, which could prompt recounts in the hotly contested races for governor and U.S. Senate.\n\nAt stake was the tight and acrimonious U.S. Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. The governor\u2019s race between former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, might also face a recount.\n\nThe recounts reflect a deeply divided electorate in a state that will play a critical role in the 2020 election and will determine whether Nelson will return to Washington for a fourth term or the Republicans will pad their majority in the Senate.\n\nGillum conceded to DeSantis on Tuesday night, but when the results began to narrow, he said every vote should count. DeSantis has said little about the recount and is instead proceeding as if he won the election, appointing a transition team and preparing to take office in January.\n\nHeated Senate fight\n\nThe battle for Nelson\u2019s Senate seat has been much more heated, with both sides filing lawsuits and trading verbal jabs. Scott has said Nelson is trying to steal the election, while Nelson is accusing Scott of trying to stop elections officials from counting every ballot.\n\nScott had asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections departments in South Florida\u2019s Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties after his lead narrowed in ballot-counting that continued through the week. However, a spokeswoman for the agency said Friday that there were no credible allegations of fraud; therefore, no active investigation.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, filed lawsuits in both counties seeking more information on how their ballots were being tallied. Nelson filed his own federal lawsuit Friday, seeking to postpone the Saturday deadline to submit unofficial election results.\n\nJudges sided with Scott in rulings late Friday ordering election supervisors in the two counties to release information on ballot-counting sought by the governor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Broward Canvassing Board met Friday to review ballots that had been initially deemed ineligible. Lawyers from the campaigns, journalists and citizens crowded into a room to observe the proceedings.\n\nVery tight races\n\nScott\u2019s lead had narrowed by Friday evening to 0.18 percentage points, a lead of less than 15,000 out of nearly 8.2 million ballots cast, and below the threshold for a recount. Florida law requires a machine recount when the leading candidate\u2019s margin is 0.5 percentage points or less, and a hand recount if it\u2019s 0.25 or less.\n\nIn the race for governor, DeSantis was leading by 0.43 percentage points late Friday.\n\nA third statewide race that could go to a recount, the agriculture commissioner race between Democrat Nikki Fried and Republican Matt Caldwell, is the tightest of all, with Fried holding a 3,120-vote lead, a margin of 0.039 percent."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Readies to Stave Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-ebola-drc-border/4653039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

The FDA's planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.\n\nThere has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an \"epidemic.\"\n\n\"E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 trend among teens,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. \"The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we're seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end.

The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.\n\nThe planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.\n\nJuul competitors\n\nThe only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc.\n\nThose products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nE-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul's business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco's global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.\n\nAltria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA's concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nRepresentatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening. A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.\n\nDivisive products\n\nJuul has previously said the company wants to be \"part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people\" but that \"appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.\"\n\nMeredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency's move was a \"good first step,\" but added that \"the final step should have happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"Why not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?\" she said.\n\nE-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.\n\nLast year the FDA, under Gottlieb, extended until 2022 a deadline for e-cigarette companies to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Prepares to Fight Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-prepares-to-fight-off-ebola-along-drc-border-/4651129.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

The Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, to be exact.\n\nSo could it be that the object, called Oumuamua, Hawaiian for 'scout', is truly some kind of alien artifact, or an actual space probe sent to spy on all us Earthlings?\n\nHate to be a bummer, but no!\n\nLet's throw away our scientific and journalist objectivity for a moment and admit that most people want the answer to be 'yes.'\n\nThat's why scientists spend so much time looking for extrasolar planets that are like Earth, and why we want to get closer looks at Mars, and send probes to Europa or Enceladus or any place with oceans of liquid water. Researchers and astronomers all want some proof that humans are not all alone in the universe.\n\nBut in this case, based on conversations VOA has had with astronomers, and based on everything scientists know about space rocks, comets, and asteroids, Oumuamua doesn't seem to be acting much differently than any other space rock out there in the void.\n\nBut here's what scisntists do know about Oumuamua, and that might help explain why some scientists are so excited about it, whether it offers proof of alien intelligence or not.\n\nOumuamua was the first interstellar object to visit our solar system. That means it came from another star system like our own. It flew between Mercury and the Sun in November 2017, almost exactly a year ago.\n\nIt moved really quickly, at about 136-thousand kilometers per hour. Michele Bannister from Queen's College in Belfast told VOA that scientists only had about three weeks to get a good look at it.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nOumuamua is reddish, and about 400 meters long. However, it's 10 times longer than it is wide, so basically it looks a bit like a giant, dirty interstellar icicle. In space terms, 400 meters is tiny, so just finding the thing was a big win for astronomers.\n\n\u201cFor decades we\u2019ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there,\" says NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen \"and now\u2015for the first time\u2015we have direct evidence they exist.\u201d\n\nThat's really interesting, but how did the whole \"aliens\" thing get started? Well, it turns out that Oumuamua is definitely 'unusual' in that it isn't just ambling through the galaxy. It's changing speed and direction by itself. Bannister calls this \"non-gravitational acceleration.\"\n\nIt turns out that's not particularly strange or even unusual. Bannister says this rock is likely filled with the kinds of things that comets and asteroids generally have in abundance. Carbon monoxide, for instance or cyanide. If so, when they get close to the sun and get warm, these gases shoot out like jets in a process called sublimation. This is likely what made Oumuamua look like it was acting under its own power, because it was in a way.\n\nHere's how NASA explains this outgassing acceleration:\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nWe'll never really know\n\nBut that perfectly reasonable explanation didn't stop Harvard scientists Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from putting forth a few possible alternate possibilities for Oumuamua, including one that suggests our interstellar space rock was a lightsail, a giant sail that uses energy from the sun instead of wind to push a vehicle through space.\n\nThey suggest this might be a possibility because some other studies suggest our interstellar wanderer isn't a comet and isn't doing any outgassing. Hence the solar sail idea. And the team does the math to show how Oumuamua might fit the bill.\n\nThe other possibility put forward by Bialy and Loeb is that \"Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\" They do the math here as well to show how Oumuamua's trajectory might make sense if it was aimed our way.\n\nIt's important to note that the paper hasn't been peer reviewed yet, which is the process all scientific research goes through before it gets published by reputable journals like Science, or Nature. That means other scientists in the same field read it over, give input and check on its validity. So we'll see what happens with this paper.\n\nBut as far as Oumuamua goes, it's too small for even our best telescopes to get a look at, so researchers have all the information they'll ever have.\n\nBut don't worry, there are likely a lot more Oumuamua's out there. \u201cThe galaxy is filled with flying rocks,\u201d Bannister says. \"Trillions upon trillions\" of space rocks, ranging in size from a \"skyscraper\" to a planet, are likely roaming around the galaxy. And if we're lucky, Bannister says we should be able to see about one a year.\n\nSo, in a way the Earth is getting visitors from other stars, but they're just random rocks passing through. So, no aliens, but still pretty really great science."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Study Links Social Media to Depression, Loneliness", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/study-links-social-media-to-depression-loneliness/4652794.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "University of Pennsylvania researchers say that for the first time they have linked social media use to increases in depression and loneliness.\n\nThe idea that social media is anything but social when it comes to mental health has been talked about for years, but not many studies have managed to actually link the two.\n\nTo do that, Penn researchers, led by psychologist Melissa Hunt, designed a study that focused on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe results were published in the November issue of the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.\n\nHow study worked\n\nThe study was conducted with 143 participants, who before they began, completed a mood survey and sent along photos of their battery screens, showing how often they were using their phones to access social media.\n\n\u201cWe set out to do a much more comprehensive, rigorous study that was also more ecologically valid,\u201d Hunt said.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

What struck me the most was that in less than a generation, a fairly small pool of young women broke into this institution, powered through these various obstacles to form an internationally successful team, and ultimately became heroes of sorts for this entire region,\u201d he said.\n\nIn \u201cCool Runnings\u201d fashion, the women have emerged as respected contenders on the international stage and have received visits from the likes of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and four-time Olympic ice hockey gold medallist Hayley Wickenheiser.\n\nIt\u2019s an inspiring story adorned with the sort of photos (of makeshift ice rinks and Himalayan landscapes) you can spend a long time staring at.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nFor more great stories from India, follow @HuffPostIndia.

Perpetrators historically rarely faced more than a fine, experts say, but can now be sentenced to up to five years in prison thanks to a law that took effect in September.\n\nThe Sexual Harassment Law was passed earlier this year amid an uproar over the arrest and swift release of a man who ejaculated on a fellow bus passenger. The crime was considered a misdemeanor.\n\nThis classification gave perpetrators a sense of impunity and showed a lack of regard for violence against women, said Silvia Chakian, a S\u00e3o Paulo prosecutor who focuses on crimes against women.\n\n\u201cThese cases used to be left in a legislative gap,\u201d Chakian said. \u201cIt was difficult to find a legal framing between \u2018insult to decency,\u2019 which is a misdemeanor with an insignificant penalty, and the crime of rape, which is a more serious crime with prison terms of six to 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe new law defines sexual harassment as a lewd act against someone without their consent that is committed by someone \u201cto satisfy their own lust or that of a third person.\u201d It carries a penalty of one to five years in prison.\n\nBetween Sept. 25, when the law took effect, and Oct. 23, 36 incidents of sexual harassment were reported on buses, trains and subways in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area alone, according to a HuffPost Brazil analysis of transit authority data.\n\nDespite the problem\u2019s persistence, the law is widely seen as a crucial step toward curbing harassment of women in public spaces.\n\nReporting Harassment\n\nThe first arrest for sexual harassment on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public transit system was made the day after the law took effect.\n\nA woman reported that a man sat next to her on a train and ran his hand over her legs. She got off the train at the next station and reported the incident to security officials, who found the suspect and brought him to police. After an initial hearing, the man was released pending the outcome of his trial, but he is required to check in with authorities each month until the case goes to court, according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Court of Justice.\n\nThe incident was one of 13 cases of sexual harassment reported between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23 on S\u00e3o Paulo trains, according to transit authority data. Six other cases were reported on metro area buses. Seventeen incidents were reported on the city\u2019s subways, and subway officials say 13 of those resulted in arrests.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This file photo from 2013 shows passengers riding escalators to access subway platforms in Sao Paulo.\n\nThe three companies that manage public transportation in the greater S\u00e3o Paulo area advise victims of sexual harassment to immediately seek help from transit employees \u2014 bus drivers or security officials at train and subway stations \u2014 and to identify perpetrators, if possible. Representatives from the companies said they had trained their employees to help these women and have been intensifying campaigns to combat harassment.\n\nMetr\u00f4, the city\u2019s subway authority, allows users to report incidents and send photos and videos to authorities via a mobile app or SMS service. The city\u2019s train authority allows also allows victims to report harassment anonymously through its own SMS service.\n\nUsed Condoms In Bags\n\nBut the reporting system hasn\u2019t been effective for everyone. Clara Novais, a 27-year-old journalist, told HuffPost Brazil that she couldn\u2019t find any subway authority to help her after a man put a used condom in her bag.\n\n\u201cI felt a liquid dripping on me and thought it might be my lunch that was leaking out of my backpack, but when I stopped to look closely, it was actually a used condom,\u201d she said. \u201cI had seen other freaky sexual cases on the subway, and my first reaction was to think, \u2018I do not believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d The alleged incident happened on a train on Oct. 2,10 days after the law took effect.\n\nNovais said she could not find an employee to help her once she got off the train. \u201cI complained on the [train authority] website and published [my account] on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cSo before going to the police station, I was interviewed by some media outlets and went to make the police report at night.\u201d\n\nOther stories began to emerge after Novais went public.\n\nRebecca Barboza, a 25-year-old designer, told HuffPost Brazil she found a condom on her belongings on the same day as Novais.\n\n\u201cIt happened on my birthday. I was already leaving the subway, on the escalator, and was distracted answering texts when I felt something cold on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran my hand over it and smelled something terrible.

The woman brought Barboza to transit authority staff, who advised her to file a police report at a station inside the terminal.\n\nAuthorities there refused to label the offense as sexual harassment, Barboza said, and instead classified it as a misdemeanor \u201cinsult to decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the time I arrived, I said it was sexual harassment, and the official said it was not,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked why, and he said there was no physical contact.\u201d\n\nI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment. ...

And we come from a judiciary system that still needs to learn to deal with gender issues, to understand what gender violence, sexual violence, and lewd acts are. The law has not yet comprehended these concepts and replicates the chauvinist and patriarchal culture.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the two condom cases, Chakian said it was impossible to say if they can be framed under the new criminal classification, adding that each would have to be carefully assessed.\n\nIn response to inquiries about the classification of both condom incidents, the Civil Police said that each case \u201cis classified based on the report given by the victim at the time of registration and may be changed during the investigations, without prejudice to the accountability of harassers.\u201d Both cases are currently under investigation."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Ryanair Sacks Cabin Crew For Allegedly Faking Photo Of Sleeping On Airport Floor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryanair-cabin-crew-sleeping-airport-fired_us_5be3d415e4b0dbe871a6d726", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Ryanair has sacked six cabin crew members who were photographed sleeping on the floor of a Spanish airport last month due to flight disruptions.\n\nThe low-cost Irish airline alleges that the image, which has been widely circulated on social media, is a \u201cfake\u201d and the staff had subsequently been dismissed for gross misconduct on Monday.\n\nFirst shared on Twitter by Jim Atkinson, the image purported to show crew members based in Portugal forced to sleep on the floor after flights to the city of Porto were disrupted \u201cdue to storms.\u201d\n\nThis is a Ryanair 737 crew based in Portugal, stranded in Malaga, Spain a couple of nights ago due to storms.

Carol Becker, president of the adoption group God\u2019s Greyts, told the Times that many are on \u201cpins and needles\u201d trying to line up foster homes and future vet care for when the tracks start closing.\n\nOthers aren\u2019t as concerned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a panic, we are not going to change the way we do adoptions,\u201d Maryann Tolliver, president of the Greyhound Pets of America Tampa Bay, told the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nSince the ban doesn\u2019t fully kick in until 2020, Tolliver said, the end of racing will likely be more like a phase-out, meaning dogs will trickle into rescues as opposed to coming all at once.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The identification tattoo on the ear of a former racing greyhound.\n\nSo, how do I adopt one of these greyhounds? Do I have to live in Florida?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to live in Florida to adopt a retired greyhound, since there are rescue groups around the country that receive ex-racing dogs and work to find them local homes. That means the best way to apply to adopt a greyhound is to find a rescue group near you.\n\nThe Greyhound Project Inc. has a directory of adoption groups by state on its website. If you aren\u2019t able to adopt but still want to help, you can ask an organization if it needs foster homes, volunteers or donations.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Former greyhound racers Josephine, left, and Turkey.\n\nWhat should I know about greyhounds?\n\nLike any type of dog, greyhounds\u2019 personalities vary from individual to individual. That said, there are a few things to generally keep in mind if you\u2019re interested in adopting a retired greyhound.\n\nGreyhounds are known to be sociable and loving with people and are often nicknamed \u201c40 mph couch potatoes.\u201d That\u2019s because, though they can run high speeds, they also tend to spend most of their time lounging and napping.\n\nNumerous rescue groups also point out that greyhounds do need exercise and regular walks, but it\u2019s a misconception that the dogs are hyperactive or need enormous amounts of room.\n\nMichael McCann of The Greyhound Project previously told The Bark that greyhounds are great \u201cif you\u2019re looking for a dog you can take walks with, and then come home and settle right down.\u201d But, he noted, greyhounds typically are dogs that need to be in a fenced-in yard or on a leash, since they\u2019re apt to sprint off at a moment\u2019s notice if something catches their eye.\n\nMany greyhounds also have a high prey drive and are apt to chase small animals, meaning that not all of them can be safely homed with smaller pets like cats. However, many greyhounds can ultimately live in harmony with cats, so you\u2019ll need to assess your situation with the rescue group.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Greyhounds are known to give a lot of love to people."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "California Faces Its Most Destructive Wildfire In State History", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-most-destructive-wildfire_us_5be6fe01e4b0dbe871ab8910", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "California continues to reckon with the most destructive wildfire it has ever seen as thousands of structures topple and the death toll rises to nine.\n\nThe Camp fire, centered on the Northern California town of Paradise, has incinerated 90,000 acres and nearly 7,000 structures, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported.

She also visits communities that are vulnerable to raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and distributes information about undocumented people\u2019s legal rights and how to prepare a family when a relative is set to be deported.\n\n\u201cIt can be very difficult to see the pain in people\u2019s faces and the panic,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cUnless you are facing the threat of deportation, you don\u2019t understand that kind of terror.\u201d\n\nAugust saw a massive ICE presence in Sumner, Texas, where agents arrested 159 people at a trailer manufacturing company. RAICES offered legal services to 170 people as a result of the raid and helped pay bond for 20 or so detainees, according to NBC.\n\nPe\u00f1a sat down with HuffPost to explain what it\u2019s like working to connect undocumented people with legal representation and shared some of the biggest challenges she and her colleagues face.\n\nHow did you first get involved with RAICES?\n\nI joined RAICES in March of 2017, but I volunteered the previous December when ICE released over 450 asylum-seeking families from detention, stranding them at the San Antonio bus station, many without tickets for forward travel or even the means to contact their family members or sponsors who were receiving them in the United States. The RAICES emergency shelter was overflowing. Allied shelters were beyond capacity. The entire city was overwhelmed, and ICE could not or would not say why these families were released en masse.\n\nSeeing these families, all of whom were fleeing terror, corruption and violence in their home countries, with no way to move forward, made a huge impression on me. That was my wake-up call.\n\nIt\u2019s really powerful and moving to understand the resiliency and the courage these families have to make a trip like that, knowing that there is the possibility they may not be granted asylum, they may be returned back to their home country. They are still willing to undertake such incredible risks to keep their family safe \u2015 it really touched me.\n\nHow did you feel when the family separations were revealed earlier this year?\n\nMy first thought was for the mental health of these children. The terror of being ripped away from their mothers and fathers is unimaginable. How is a 4-year-old child supposed to process that? How is that child ever going to feel safe again?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for most people to understand that RAICES represents children who would otherwise appear alone in immigration court. Can you imagine a child going up against the full weight of the U.S. government without access to counsel? Yet it happens regularly. We are here to shine a light on this broken immigration system.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge you currently face in your job?\n\nAdequately explaining to the public how dire the situation is. Every single day, we have attorneys, social workers and legal assistants going into detention centers and making sure that vulnerable immigrant populations have access to due process, legal counsel. We want to make sure our staff has access to the centers, that they are getting in, that they are able to work with these families and prepare them for their next legal steps. Unless they have access to pro-bono services, they are lost in this sea of immigration proceedings.\n\nWe are here to shine a light on this broken immigration system. Barbara Pe\u00f1a, Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services\n\nAnd you have to remember that there is a language barrier. So even if they have access to an interpreter, the interpreter may not understand their accents or may speak too quickly \u2015 there is always the possibility of miscommunication. There are a very high number of families who come from southern Mexico and Guatemala who are indigenous accent speakers, and there are very often no interpreters available for those families.\n\nWhat are some other roadblocks that hinder the work you\u2019re doing in this political climate, which is so openly hostile to immigrants?\n\nHere in the United States, we do ourselves such disservice by not having an interest in the immigration debate until it impacts us on the southern border. We fail to understand the root of the problem. There is a lack of information about the country conditions that are driving these families to come here seeking asylum in the first place.\n\nIf you look at a place like El Salvador, not much has changed in the last 30 years. There is still crushing poverty, incredible rates of intrafamilial violence. Many of the women and girls we see are fleeing homicidal domestic violence. There is third- and fourth-generation gang violence in a place where there is very little governmental infrastructure, and gangs have completely overrun some neighborhoods. Your average American doesn\u2019t really understand what that kind of violence looks like.\n\nAny success stories that have made you glad to do what you do for a living?\n\nThe highlight of my summer was helping one of our clients board her flight to join her family in another part of the country. She and her daughter had been separated under \u201czero tolerance,\u201d and through the diligent work of our attorneys, they were reunited. I will never forget the look of hope on her face as she and her daughter received their boarding passes. Even something as simple as being able to sit together on the flight to their new home was very meaningful for them. It made me want to work harder on behalf of those families who have yet to be reunited.\n\nEarlier this year, RAICES said it would help reunite migrant families separated under \u201czero tolerance\u201d by using the $20 million from a viral fundraising campaign.

Sherrod Brown may be America\u2019s most underrated politician. The question now is whether that\u2019s about to change.\n\nThe day after a midterm election that saw President Trump losing ground in cities and suburbs while holding his own everywhere else, talk among Democrats has already turned to 2020.\n\n\u201cWhat did Tuesday say about how the Democrats can win back the White House?\u201d operatives and observers began to ask even before the last ballots were counted. \u201cAnd which candidates-in-waiting saw their stock rise as a result?\u201d\n\nSo far speculation has swirled around rising star Beto O\u2019Rourke, who came within 2.6 percentage points of unseating incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in ruby-red Texas.\n\nProgressives have pointed to red-state losses among centrist senators such as Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota as evidence that moderation won\u2019t work two Novembers from now; centrists have pointed to red-state losses among progressive heroes such as O\u2019Rourke, Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Andrew Gillum of Florida to make the opposite argument.\n\nAnd the usual suspects \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris \u2014 have been mentioned again and again.\n\nFew, however, have been mentioning Brown. That\u2019s probably a mistake.\n\n\u201c[Brown] has a reservoir of wisdom the Dems could draw from,\u201d former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello declared Tuesday on Twitter.\n\nOf all the Democrats who could plausibly play a part in the looming drama of the next presidential campaign, the raspy, rumpled populist emerged from Election Day with by far the most to brag about.\n\nLike his fellow Rust Belt Democrats \u2014 Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania \u2014 Brown cruised to reelection in a state that broke for Trump in 2016.\n\nUnlike Stabenow, Baldwin or Casey, however, Brown managed to win in a state that backed Trump by 8 percent two years ago \u2014 not less than 1 percent, like the others \u2014 and where Republicans swept all of 2018\u2019s other competitive contests, from governor on down.\n\nYahoo News Supporters of Sen. Sherrod Brown celebrate his victory on Nov. 6, 2018, in Columbus.\n\nIn fact, Brown received 280,000 more votes than his party\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, Richard Cordray, and 100,000 more than Cordray\u2019s victorious Republican rival, Mike DeWine. Brown actually won by a larger margin Tuesday than in 2012, when Barack Obama was on the ballot to boost Democratic turnout. And the gap between his victory this year and Trump\u2019s in 2016 \u2014 a swing of 14.5 percentage points \u2014 was wider than all but Jon Tester\u2019s in Montana and Joe Manchin\u2019s in West Virginia.\n\nThe kicker is that while Tester and Manchin ran as moderates, and while Casey, Stabenow and Baldwin tend to legislate from the center-left, Brown has compiled one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate \u2014 a record on which he proudly campaigned. According to the data journalists at FiveThirtyEight, Brown votes with Trump only 28.2 percent of the time \u2014 roughly 41 percent less often than you would expect based on how strongly Ohio supported Trump in 2016. That\u2019s the second-largest \u201cTrump-minus\u201d score in the entire Senate.\n\nFor Brown, defying the odds is nothing new. As a 2017 BuzzFeed profile put it, the senator has \u201ccombined a fierce populism and unapologetic progressive ideals to repeatedly win local and state elections \u2014 even as Ohio has trended increasingly conservative.\u201d He\u2019s won in cities and rural communities, old manufacturing hubs and college towns, diverse districts and mostly white districts.\n\nAnd now he\u2019s won 10 times in row.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 1992, Brown secured reelection two years later by picking off Republican-leaning workers who\u2019d previously backed Ross Perot\u2019s anti-NAFTA presidential bid. In 2012, running for a second Senate term, he earned 95 percent of the black vote and outperformed his GOP rival, state Treasurer Josh Mandel, in many white, industrial parts of the state \u2014 including Mahoning and Trumbull counties, where Brown took 66 percent and 62 percent of the vote respectively. On Tuesday, Brown again won both counties by 15- to 20-point margins.\n\nGetty Images Brown shakes hands with workers as they leave the Ford Engine Plant in 2006 in Brook Park, Ohio.\n\nAs Yahoo News has previously reported, Brown didn\u2019t accomplish this by moderating his staunchly liberal views on social and cultural issues. He was one of only two members of Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996; he\u2019s pro-LGBTQ, pro-abortion rights, pro-gun control, and pro-criminal justice reform. (He was the first senator to oppose Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as attorney general.)\n\nInstead, Brown keeps winning in Ohio because he has spent his entire career obsessing, first and foremost, over the concerns of workers.\n\nNot just white workers, the way Trump did in 2016. All workers.\n\n\u201cI do my very best to fight for working people in this job,\u201d Brown told Yahoo News last year. \u201cAnd that means all workers \u2014 whether you punch a time sheet or swipe a badge, make a salary or earn tips. Whether you\u2019re on payroll, a contract worker or a temp \u2014 working behind a desk, on a factory floor or behind a restaurant counter. The fact is, all workers across this country are feeling squeezed.\u201d\n\nOther, higher-profile Senate populists \u2014 Sanders and Warren \u2014 tend to view the world through an anti-Wall Street lens. Brown sees everything from a pro-worker perspective. To the casual listener, Sanders and Warren can sound as if they\u2019re bashing billionaires or bankers because they\u2019re billionaires or bankers \u2014 a message that might resonate in liberal enclaves like Vermont or Massachusetts but doesn\u2019t play as well in middle America.\n\nIn contrast, Brown is always careful to remind voters that the real problem isn\u2019t corporate profits per se \u2014 it\u2019s that \u201cworkers are no longer sharing in the wealth they help create.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Sherrod, the message works because of the messenger,\u201d Perriello explains. \u201cHe has never wavered in standing up to power brokers in D.C. \u2014 and even in his own party \u2014 to fight for families, workers and consumers. He can sell it because people buy that he means it, that he is fighting for us.\u201d\n\nFor 18 years, Brown refused to enroll in a congressional health plan, saying he would not accept federally subsidized care until the American public could also avail itself of the same option. As a state representative in the mid-1970s, he spent long days listening to tales of worry and woe at the steelworkers\u2019 union hall in his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. He went on to lead the bipartisan opposition to NAFTA, crossing then-President Bill Clinton; more than two decades later, he helped torpedo the Trans-Pacific Partnership, defying Barack Obama. In between, Brown wrote a book called Myths of Free Trade. On election night 2016, he surprised his gloomy staffers by immediately offering to help Trump renegotiate NAFTA (a promise he\u2019s kept). And when Brown rescued a shaggy black dog, he named it Franklin \u2014 as in Roosevelt, the Democrat who created the New Deal.\n\nAFP Brown looks on as Teamsters Union President James P. Hoffa voices his opposition to Mexican trucks entering the U.S. under the NAFTA deal, in Washington, D.C., in 2001.\n\nWhen asked about a possible White House bid, the senator tends to dismiss the notion with lukewarm responses such as \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of running for president\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t \u2026 have any real interest in that\u201d \u2014 though he also admits he hasn\u2019t ruled it out.\n\n\u201cI hear it more and more,\u201d Brown conceded in a September interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cI think about it from time to time.\u201d\n\nIn truth, Brown seems much more excited about the idea that his strategy could serve as a road map for some other 2020 candidate. \u201cI hope the message that I win with \u2014 the dignity of work and whose side are you on \u2014 gets into the national debate,\u201d he recently told CNBC. \u201cBecause plenty of my colleagues want to be president a lot more than I do.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Brown has released a suite of populist policy proposals that would strengthen key labor standards to reflect an economy that increasingly relies on alternative work arrangements (temps, subcontractors, freelancers, and such). He wouldn\u2019t just raise the minimum wage and require paid sick days and paid family leave. He would also expand collective bargaining rights. He would ensure that alternative workers get benefits too. And he would crack down on employers that force people to work off the clock, refuse to pay the minimum wage, deny overtime pay, take tips, or knowingly misclassify workers to avoid paying fair wages.\n\nFinally \u2014 and perhaps most potently \u2014 Brown would implement what he calls a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach to big companies that slash labor costs to pad their profits.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are going to cut taxes on the largest corporations and the wealthiest people in the country,\u201d the senator has explained. \u201cI think \u2026 those companies that pay a living wage and provide health benefits and retirement benefits and don\u2019t outsource their jobs, they should get a lower tax rate. But the companies that pay $10 or $11 [an hour] so that their employees get food stamps and Medicaid and Section 8 housing vouchers? Those companies should pay a Corporate Freeloader Fee, because taxpayers have to subsidize those corporations\u2019 wages.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s plan is probably too bold to become law anytime soon \u2014 but as a declaration of intent aimed directly at blue-collar Americans, it couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cBecause he gets how much families are struggling, Sherrod knows that you make smart solutions more appealing not by cutting the idea in half but by doubling it,\u201d Perriello says. \u201cWhile Beltway pundits try to label ideas on a mythical left-right spectrum, people in Ohio and around the country care only about where it fits in terms of making a difference at the kitchen table.\u201d\n\nYahoo News Brown, surrounded by members of his family, speaks in Columbus after his campaign victory.\n\nWho knows whether voters outside of Ohio will ever hear a message like Brown\u2019s. It\u2019s possible, even probable, that Democrats will continue to shy away from so-called class warfare and resist even a progressive concept of class identity \u2014 a concept that sees class not as a way to turn white workers against the rest of the electorate, as Trump has done, but rather as a way to unite all working-class Americans, regardless of their other identities, around a set of reforms that might help them withstand a 21st-century economy that has rapidly and ruthlessly turned against them: black or white, gay or straight, blue-collar or white-collar.\n\nBut if 2018\u2019s divided results demonstrated anything, it\u2019s that, going forward, such an approach may be the surest way for Democrats to succeed again in states like Ohio that have been trending red; to stymie Trump in purple states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania; and perhaps to win back the White House.\n\n\u201cLet our country \u2014 our nation\u2019s citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country \u2014 let them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest, to our Great Lakes state,\u201d Brown said in his victory speech Tuesday night. \u201cYou showed the country that progressives can win \u2014 and win decisively \u2014 in the heartland, [and] that by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work, we can carry a state Donald Trump won by nearly 10 points.\u201d\n\nLest anyone missed the point, Brown went on to contrast his kind of populism with Trump\u2019s \u2014 and to link his winning campaign to the coming presidential election.\n\n\u201cPopulists are not racists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not appeal to some by pushing down others. We do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border. \u2026 We will never ever give up the hallowed ground of patriotism to the extremists \u2014 at the statehouse and in the White House.\n\n\u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the reluctant Brown will challenge Trump in two years\u2019 time; his decision will probably depend on whether another Democrat is willing to pick up the pro-worker baton.\n\nAnd even if he does run, it\u2019s unclear that his gruff, earnest, understated style would translate to a national stage where Trumpian brashness and bombast have increasingly become the norm.\n\nStill, for anyone trying to find a 2020 message in the aftermath of 2018, Brown\u2019s may have been the clearest signal amid a lot of noise.\n\n_____"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "How Rep. Steve King Almost Lost", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressman-steve-king-almost-lost-white-supremacist_us_5be5f7a2e4b0769d24cd2a77", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 Yidnekachew Yilma immigrated to the U.S. seven years ago from Ethiopia. On Tuesday evening, he was among a handful of voters inside a Lutheran church\u2019s gymnasium, casting a ballot near a basketball hoop. He walked out into the cold and the wind, the sun setting over Sioux City, smiling. He felt proud.\n\n\u201cI got my citizenship two months ago, so this is the first time\u201d to vote, he told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nYilma, 33, works at a meatpacking plant. The man who represents him in Congress, white supremacist Rep. Steve King, would rather people like Yilma not live in northwest Iowa, or anywhere else in America.\n\nKing is arguably the most bigoted member of Congress. For years, he\u2019s parroted and promoted the propaganda of white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and openly associated with fascist and far-right figures at home and overseas. \u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d he once wrote in a tweet.\n\nYilma said he\u2019d heard King didn\u2019t like immigrants. He decided to vote for King\u2019s Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, after seeing one of Scholten\u2019s campaign ads on YouTube. \u201cI trust him,\u201d Yilma said.\n\nIn the week leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, to the shock of political observers, it seemed Scholten had a real shot at unseating King, an eight-term congressman who\u2019s routinely won re-election by over 20 percentage points in this rural, deeply conservative corner of the Hawkeye State. One pre-election poll had shown Scholten trailing King by just 1 percentage point.\n\nBut by late Tuesday night, the dream of a Democratic upset here was over. Scholten \u2014 a towering, 38-year-old former minor league baseball player and paralegal with a shaved head \u2014 walked around his election night party at a hotel on the Missouri River. He hugged and thanked supporters, posed for selfies and did interviews with local TV stations.\n\nAs the party died down, Scholten was a couple of beers deep and feeling candid. Earlier, he\u2019d done the polite and customary thing of calling King to congratulate him.\n\nCongressional Quarterly via Getty Images Iowa Democratic candidate J.D. Scholten\n\n\u201cStraight up, it sucked,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost about the call. He\u2019d lost to King by 3 percentage points.\n\n\u201cThe difficult thing in all of it is why the Iowa I know, the Iowa I grew up in, continues to go for King,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly, that\u2019s the toughest question I have, and I still don\u2019t have a good answer for it. It\u2019s frustrating because, like, the bar of white nationalism, the bar of racism, the bar of anti-Semitism is so damn low. And we don\u2019t have a representative who can cross that bar. And that\u2019s difficult for me to grasp.\u201d\n\nKing has never denied being a white nationalist. On Oct. 21 he even appeared to defend the term itself, telling a local TV host that, although \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d is \u201ca derogatory term today, I wouldn\u2019t have thought so maybe a year, or two or three ago.\u201d\n\nYet on election night, over 159,000 people in Iowa voted for King anyway. And although there are multiple reasons for why King keeps winning here \u2014 including racism, name recognition, party loyalty and issues like abortion rights \u2014 it\u2019s maybe more instructive to consider why King came so close to losing this time.\n\nThere are 70,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. President Donald Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton here by 27 points. That Scholten came within 3 points, or about 10,000 votes, of King is remarkable and shows he garnered support from Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for Scholten,\u201d a middle-aged white woman said softly to HuffPost Monday night at a campaign rally for Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. King, who had spoken at the rally, was standing just a few feet away. \u201cHe\u2019s too extreme,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be named, said of King.\n\nAlthough King has long been a bigot, he\u2019s been particularly transparent about his fascist beliefs during his eighth term in Congress. Just last month, King endorsed a mayoral candidate in Toronto who has recited the \u201c14 words,\u201d a neo-Nazi slogan. Also last month, HuffPost uncovered an interview that King had given to an Austrian publication associated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement.\n\nIn that interview, King pushed the anti-Semitic idea that the liberal, Jewish billionaire George Soros is funding what\u2019s called the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d the conspiracy theory that immigration from non-white countries spells the end of white European culture and identity. (It\u2019s the equivalent of the \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d chant at the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally last year.)\n\nKing had managed to espouse all this nonsense with little political consequence until late October, when the massacre of 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue by a white nationalist brought King\u2019s own white nationalism under heightened scrutiny. Two days after the shooting, the polling firm Change Research published a poll showing King leading Scholten by only 1 percentage point.\n\nSuddenly the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee felt compelled to denounce King. Corporate campaign donors, under pressure for giving money to a bigot, ditched him. The Sioux City Journal, which had endorsed King in prior elections, endorsed Scholten, whose campaign was being inundated with donations: $640,000 in one 48-hour period.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to say how many voters abandoned King because of his bigotry. When King spoke at Gov. Reynolds\u2019 rally Monday night, he wasn\u2019t interrupted by a heckler calling him a racist. He was interrupted by a 44-year-old farmer, Dolf Ivener, upset over the price of soybeans.\n\n\u201c$7.50 for soybeans, I\u2019m going to go broke because of you, Steve King!\u201d Ivener yelled, before being escorted out of the rally. \u201cI\u2019m going to go broke because of you.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war with China, which King supports, has taken a real toll on farmers here. China bought 94 percent fewer soybeans this year from America than in 2017.\n\nScholten likes to remind reporters of the Midwest\u2019s oft-forgotten history of progressive economic populism. In the 1980s, it wasn\u2019t a far-right figure like King representing this part of Iowa. It was a Democrat named Berkley Bedell, one of Scholten\u2019s political heroes. Bedell was a populist who focused on economic inequality. (Scholten keeps a photo on his phone of a Bedell campaign flyer from the \u201980s: \u201cDoes the 1% now own your government? Does the 99% have a chance?\u201d)\n\nCourtesy of the J.D. Scholten campaign.\n\nScholten\u2019s campaign, which refused to take corporate PAC money, focused less on King than it did on progressive economic policies: increasing the minimum wage (Iowa has one of the lowest minimum wages in the country), strengthening unions and fighting Big Agriculture, which is squeezing farmers here for every penny they\u2019re worth.\n\n\u201cThe average person in Congress is 58 years old with a net worth of a million dollars,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m different. I\u2019m 20 years younger and about a million dollars short of that average because, you know what, I understand what it means to live paycheck to paycheck. I understand what it means to not have health care at times.\u201d (Note: The median net worth in Congress is about $900,000. Over half of the members of Congress are millionaires.)\n\nScholten campaigned hard. For six months, he drove around in an RV he called \u201cSioux City Sue,\u201d visiting voters in each of the district\u2019s 39 counties, sometimes attracting hundreds of people to town halls in deep-red parts of the district. At night he slept in the RV, which he often parked at Walmarts. (King, meanwhile, barely campaigned here, buying his first TV ad only a few days before the election.)\n\nAlthough Scholten was forceful in denouncing King\u2019s bigotry on the campaign trail, he spent more time depicting King as an absent and ineffective representative.\n\nIt was a message that resonated with The Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board, which called its endorsement of Scholten \u201ca no-brainer for any Iowan who has cringed at eight-term incumbent King\u2019s increasing obsession with being a cultural provocateur.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his almost 16 years in Congress, King has passed exactly one bill as primary sponsor, redesignating a post office,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s board wrote. \u201cHe won\u2019t debate his opponent and rarely holds public town halls. Instead, he spends his time meeting with fascist leaders in Europe and retweeting neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nHuffPost tried multiple times in Iowa to ask King\u2019s campaign about why he was polling so poorly in this year\u2019s midterm election campaign. At Reynold\u2019s campaign rally on Monday, King\u2019s son and campaign manager, Jeff King, blocked a HuffPost reporter from attempting to talk to King.\n\nOn election night, at King\u2019s results-watching party, Jeff King asked HuffPost to leave the building. When asked why, he instructed HuffPost to refer to his quote in The Des Moines Register.\n\n\u201cWe are not granting credentials to The Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth,\u201d read Jeff King\u2019s quote.\n\nOther alleged \u201cleftist propaganda\u201d outlets barred from covering King\u2019s party included the conservative Weekly Standard and The Storm Lake Times, a Pulitzer-winning newspaper based in King\u2019s district. It seemed King, known for being generous with reporters on Capitol Hill, was suddenly on the defensive.\n\nWith the close election results, there\u2019s hope among progressives that Scholten could mount a successful race next time. He had no name recognition when he started this race. Now people know who he is.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Scholten\u2019s phone lit up with text messages from big-name Democrats, including Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey, congratulating him on running such a good race. Earlier he\u2019d heard from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nFor now, though, Scholten won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll run against King in 2020. All Scholten knew, he said, was that he wanted eggs for breakfast in the morning and that, for now, he\u2019s just another \u201cunemployed\u201d and \u201csingle\u201d thirtysomething in America."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Snipes At 'Very Insulting' Emmanuel Macron Comment As He Lands In Paris", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-snipes-at-insulting-macron_us_5be67009e4b0769d24cd768d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Macron made his call for a \u201creal European army\u201d in a French radio interview. \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia \u2014 and even the United States,\u201d he said, Agence France Press reported.\n\nEurope had to be able \u201cto defend itself better alone,\u201d he said, the BBC reported.\n\nMacron said Europe had to think about its own security as the U.S. becomes a \u201cless reliable\u201d ally.\n\nHe pointed to Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a 1987 arms control agreement with Russia that helped end the Cold War.\n\nMacron said \u201cEurope and its security\u201d would be the \u201cmain victim\u201d of such a move.\n\nA French official insisted to CNN that Trump had taken Macron\u2019s words out of context.

They would be the first humans on the list, which classifies endangered, threatened and vulnerable animal species around the globe.\n\nA video from the advocacy group (see above) makes its point in part by dressing individuals with Down syndrome in costumes resembling such endangered, threatened and vulnerable species as polar bears, lions and rhinos.\n\nThe campaign is a reaction to the fact that genetic screening has led to a significant decrease in people born with Down syndrome.\n\nSince the prenatal tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, for example, almost 100 percent of women who received a positive test for Down syndrome opted for an abortion, according to CBS. As a result, the condition has been almost completely disappeared from Iceland\u2019s younger population.\n\nSome people may believe that eradicating the condition is a good thing. But advocates argue that this kind of attitude contributes to a stigma that people with Down Syndrome are lesser humans. And that kind of thinking impacts societal awareness, funding and job opportunities for those who have Down syndrome and desperately need aid \u2014 hence the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s underfunded support programs for education, higher rates of unemployment, extended waitlists for appropriate housing, or even just negative public perception and stigma, the challenges faced by people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t decreasing \u2014 they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Laura LaChance, the board chair for the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, said in a press release.\n\nThe group told HuffPost Canada that by pushing to add people with Down syndrome to the endangered species list, it\u2019s advocating for the same kinds of \u201cfunding, protections, government intervention and public awareness that species on the Endangered List receive.\u201d\n\nMany people still found the campaign\u2019s comparison of humans to animals dehumanizing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine folks with Down Syndrome would want to be considered a separate species.

Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The FDA Just Approved An Opioid 10 Times More Powerful Than Fentanyl", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fda-opioid-approval-dsuviafentanyl_us_5be58e8ce4b0dbe871aa19e5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "The Food and Drug Administration approved a controversial new opioid formulation this month, even as critics warned that it would likely be abused.\n\nThe drug, called Dsuvia, is a synthetic opioid that\u2019s 10 times more powerful than fentanyl, the potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the 72,000 drug overdose deaths the United States logged in 2017.\n\nThe newly approved formulation of Dsuvia is a tablet version that goes under the tongue.

According to my family, I had enough hearing to adapt to the hearing world and attend mainstream school. I struggled through school, not only to hear my teachers \u2015 some of whom begged for my parents to get me hearing aids \u2015 but also to hear my classmates. I felt isolated and disconnected from people most of the time, even though my mother is deaf and the Deaf world was part of my life. I experienced the jokes, bullying and rejections of growing up hard of hearing in a world where everyone can hear.\n\nYet I did learn how to adapt to the hearing world. I learned to read lips, decipher body language, and find patterns in daily activities to predict conversations. (People are predictable.) I even use reading to learn new words so it will be easier for me to grasp words within conversations. I\u2019m grateful that I understand at least 85 percent of most conversations around me. I can glide around mainstream culture and act as if I have normal hearing even if I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids.\n\nIf I\u2019m not wearing my hearing aids, I pretend I can hear everything when I really don\u2019t, just to be part of the hearing world. The truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on. On most days, that works.\n\nI use my phone flash for notifications and captions to watch TV. I ask people to repeat themselves, and I can\u2019t follow a group conversation in a noisy restaurant. I can\u2019t walk and listen at the same time. I need to see a person\u2019s face to get the full conversation. I have to strain to hear certain voices \u2015 like children\u2019s \u2015 even if I have hearing aids. The aftermath is that I get exhausted more easily. Then I avoid these necessary social interactions, even if I want to be a part of them. These challenges leave me feeling isolated, lonely and fatigued.\n\nThe truth is I miss words and nod to inaudible conversations while smiling. Sometimes, I depend on other people to tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I fit into the hearing world. But I don\u2019t fit into the Deaf world either.\n\nMy mom gave me an inherited connection to the Deaf world. She is immersed in the Deaf culture \u2015 a vibrant, talented beautiful community. Profoundly deaf in one ear since birth, my mother attended schools for Deaf children and uses interpreters to communicate with the hearing world. Her experiences provide her with a sense of belonging to the Deaf world, but they also come with constant discrimination from the hearing world.\n\nThere are some differences that create a disconnection between me and the Deaf world. As a CODA \u2015 child of a deaf adult \u2015 when I\u2019m with Deaf friends, my default role becomes that of an unofficial interpreter. I become the assigned interpreter of the group because I have enough hearing to carry a conversation with a hearing person. I remember having to interpret for my mother as a child. I was forced to interpret for her at doctor\u2019s appointments, government offices and everywhere else. Most times, I\u2019d have to miss school to attend these appointments with her.\n\nWhile the ADA law states that an interpreter must be provided to a Deaf person, the reality is that more often than not, an interpreter is not offered. So I interpret for her, but having moderate hearing loss affects my ability to interpret. I always feel anxious; I have to listen to all the verbal and non-verbal cues of the speaker, process the message, and translate to American Sign Language (ASL) \u2015 all while delivering the message simultaneously to the Deaf person. This is a much more involved and complicated process that I have not fully mastered even after years of practice.\n\nMy hearing usually leaves me uncertain of the message and stressed about the implication of delivering it incorrectly. Basically, I am terrified of getting it wrong. If I\u2019m interpreting for a friend at a doctor\u2019s office, misunderstanding how many pills she has to take can result in an overdose. Many times, a person can fully hear the message someone else is trying to communicate but doesn\u2019t understand it. This added stress makes me shy away from Deaf friends. I feel guilty because I want to relax with friends without the pressure of interpreting.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture.\n\nAnother reason I don\u2019t fit entirely into the Deaf world is that I don\u2019t need to use some of the resources available to that community. I don\u2019t personally use an interpreter to communicate. I don\u2019t need a flashing doorbell or flashing smoke alarms. I don\u2019t need video phones. I learned ASL as a child but I mainly communicate with my voice, speaking English or Spanish to friends and family.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve tried to immerse myself in the Deaf world, I have felt that my hearing loss is not profound enough to fully embrace the Deaf culture. In the past, I\u2019ve been discouraged from using my voice and pushed to only communicate in ASL. But using my voice is part of who I am, not a denial of the Deaf culture.\n\nI have a hearing husband and two sons, one whom is hard of hearing. None of them have fully mastered ASL. Learning a language is difficult and requires years of practice. Even if my husband and sons take the time to learn the language, they may never be completely fluent. Thus, we still use our voices at home when we communicate.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the Deaf community has been welcoming to me. I\u2019ve always wanted to feel like I belonged in both the Deaf and hearing worlds, but I don\u2019t fully feel a part of either.\n\nAs I continue my journey, I realize how badly I need more accessibility, compassion and acceptance from the hearing world. I don\u2019t use the same resources other people with hearing loss may request, but I still need certain accommodations. I rely on subtitles, and as a consumer of all media platforms, I still find gaps when I access videos. Video feeds have expanded; the option to caption videos in all platforms should expand as well. This is especially true for live video streams such as Instagram Live. As a creator of Facebook and Instagram videos, I find myself with limited captioning options, so I understand the limitations. Yet it is a necessary feature.\n\nAs noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nFace-to-face conversations are perfect opportunities to show compassion. It\u2019s helpful when people look at me while they speak and don\u2019t get frustrated if I ask them to repeat themselves. It\u2019s hard for me to hear people when they cover their mouths, turn away from me or talk to me from another room. Some people get frustrated when I ask them to repeat themselves, and their first response is to say, \u201cnevermind.\u201d Nevermind sounds to me like \u201cYou are not worth my time.\u201d As noisy as the world is, I\u2019m amazed at how we take for granted that someone \u2015 with or without a hearing loss \u2015 can hear or understand us.\n\nAbove all, I would like for people to accept that despite my hearing loss, I can accomplish anything I want. I\u2019m neither lucky nor unlucky. I\u2019m a professional writer, a data analyst, and I\u2019m successful in my life. My hearing loss is not a hindrance. My hearing loss does not determine my intelligence, skills, talent, focus or the lack thereof. I am hard of hearing and I work hard to succeed. I use all the resources I need to make my life work for me. Any hinderance I face comes from the unacceptability of my uniqueness.\n\nI invite the hearing world to embrace our differences so we can learn from each other and create a new world full of opportunities and adventures for everyone."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michelle Obama Reveals She Used IVF To Conceive Her Daughters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-daughters-ivf_us_5be57e9ae4b0769d24cc3eab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michelle Obama says she felt \u201clost and alone\u201d after having a miscarriage 20 years ago and underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive her two daughters.\n\n\u201cI felt like I failed because I didn\u2019t know how common miscarriages were because we don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d the former first lady said in an interview broadcast Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u2033We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama, 54, said she and Barack Obama underwent fertilization treatments to conceive daughters Sasha and Malia, now 17 and 20.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @MichelleObama to @RobinRoberts on suffering a miscarriage 20 years ago: \u201cI felt lost and alone.\u201d More coming up on @GMA and then watch the @ABC special covering her journey to motherhood and more from her memoir, \"Becoming,\" Sunday night 9/8c. https://t.co/LivWLBgeRA pic.twitter.com/gzIe8LTYC2 \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cI realized that as I was 34 and 35,\u201d the famously fit Mrs. Obama said in excerpts from an ABC special set to air Sunday. \u201cWe had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nThe revelations come ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of Mrs. Obama\u2019s memoir \u201cBecoming,\u201d in which she writes openly about everything from growing up in Chicago to confronting racism in public life and becoming the country\u2019s first black first lady.\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of \u201cBecoming,\u201d one of the most anticipated political books in recent memory.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united.

And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.\u201d\n\nEvent organizers published a list of five demands for protesters to coalesce around, including pay equity, greater transparency at several levels in Google and an end to forced arbitration agreements.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nProtesters at the walkout in New York City hoisted signs calling out sexual misconduct and gender inequity in tech, with at least a couple of pointed references to Rubin\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cHappy to quit for $90 million,\u201d read one woman\u2019s sign. \u201cNo sexual harassment required!\u201d\n\nThe first of many coordinated #GoogleWalkout protests has begun - this is at the firm\u2019s office in Singapore.
