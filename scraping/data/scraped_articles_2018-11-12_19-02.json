Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nOn Arizona's race between Reps. Kyrsten Sinema (D) and Martha McSally (R), Trump tweeted this : \"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\"\n\nHere's the thing: Nothing that Trump is alleging in these two tweets is accurate.\n\nFlorida is in the midst of an automatic machine recount that was triggered by the narrowness of the margins for both Scott (in the Senate race) and DeSantis (in the governor's race). Trump's allegation that \"large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere\" is either a) a reference to the high-profile -- and misunderstood -- story of a teacher in Broward County finding a box labeled \"provisional ballots\" (the box contained office supplies and zero actual ballots) or b) Trump's misunderstanding (purposeful or not) that the original vote count in Broward County took longer than some other counties in the state. Either way, what Trump is alleging is not accurate -- or at least not accurate given all publicly available evidence.\n\nIn Arizona, it's similarly hard to figure out what Trump is even talking about. I believe his \"SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH\" claim is related to potential discrepancies between the signatures on mail-in ballots and those the state has on file for voters. In those instances where a clear discrepancy is found, a call is placed to the voter to ascertain if they were, in fact, the person who had voted. ( This is a good explainer on the real story in Arizona .)\n\nThe point here is that in both circumstances, Trump is yelling \"FRAUD\" despite a decided lack of evidence to that end. What appears to be happening -- in both Florida and Arizona -- is that the election law is being followed. Is it a cumbersome process in both places? Absolutely! But that doesn't mean an election is being stolen from anyone. In fact, both Scott and DeSantis are still very likely to win -- as machine recounts very rarely produce huge vote flips, the sort of flips Democrats need to win those states. In Arizona, Sinema appears to be headed to a narrow but not razor-thin win. ( Sinema is ahead by 1.5 percentage points with more than 2.1 million votes counted .)\n\nTrump's approach is fact-free, yes. But that's nothing new.\n\nWhat IS important, though, is what Trump's baseless claims about the Florida and Arizona races tell us about how he will approach his own re-election race in 2020.\n\nWe already know that Trump is simply unwilling and unable to accept that he doesn't win -- or isn't the best or the most popular or whatever -- in every single situation. To do that, he often makes things up like that he had the largest inauguration crowd ever or that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. Or that the 2018 election was \"very close to complete victory\" for him and Republicans.\n\nNow, fast forward to November 8 (or so) 2020. (The election is on November 3 in 2020.) And imagine that Trump has lost the White House as a result of a close loss -- a 1 percentage point margin -- in Florida. Is there ANY circumstance you can imagine where Trump doesn't claim fraud? Doesn't insist that the election is being stolen from him -- and, by extension, his supporters? Doesn't refuse to concede the race and instead seeks to invalidate the result?\n\nI can't. Not based on a) what we know about Trump and b) how he has approached the aftermath of the elections in Florida and Arizona. (REMINDER: Republicans are VERY likely to win both the Senate race and governor's race in Florida.) And such an unwillingness by a outgoing president to acknowledge his defeat could have consequences well beyond what Trump has wrought with his many other false claims over the past three years.\n\nIt's not great to have the President claim that he would have won the popular vote if not for millions of illegal votes. But it doesn't change the underlying political reality: Trump is President because he won -- with no questions or asterisks -- the Electoral College vote, and that is the way we choose presidents.\n\nIt's a very different thing if the President of the United States is defeated and refuses to acknowledge that fact because, well, he is incapable of seeing the damage he is doing to the peaceful transfer of power that makes American democracy a beacon of hope around the globe. An unwillingness to concede -- coupled with the likelihood that Trump would argue that the whole process had been rigged against him -- could create a major crisis, particularly given the unquestioning loyalty his supporters have shown for him in the first two years of his tenure.\n\nNow, this all could be a moot point if Trump wins a second term. But at the moment, Trump's approval numbers suggest he will face a very serious fight for another four years -- and he could very well lose. And that's when the irresistible force runs into the unmovable object: A documented loss on the one hand, Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge defeat on the other.\n\nThat would not end well -- for democracy.\n\nCORRECTION: This story's headline has been updated to correctly refer to the Senate race in Arizona."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Defeated GOP congressman blames McCain for House flipping", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GtwaaAya7aA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A Republican unseated in the midterm elections last week has come out with an op-ed blaming the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain for the party losing control of the House.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece , outgoing Minnesota GOP Rep. Jason Lewis pinned the wave of Democratic victories last week on McCain's vote in July 2017 to sink a GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\"MCain's last-minute decision prompted a 'green wave' of liberal special-interest money, which was used to propagate false claims that the House plan 'gutted coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,'\" Lewis wrote.\n\nMcCain, along with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, crossed party lines to defeat the GOP's so-called \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare. The bill would have allowed states to waive key provisions in the landmark health care law, such as the requirements that insurers provide comprehensive coverage and put limits on consumers' out-of-pocket spending. This would have likely raised costs for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHealth care was one of the most talked about issues in the midterm elections, and Obamacare's protections for those with pre-existing conditions became a major point of focus. Despite the provisions of the White House-supported repeal effort and the Justice Department's own legal filings to the contrary, President Donald Trump tweeted in late October that \"Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions.\"\n\nMcCain died earlier this year and was a famed veteran of the Vietnam War. Lewis' op-ed was published on Veterans' Day.\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of the late senator, responded to the piece on Twitter, writing, \"This is abhorrent.\"\n\nLewis, in his op-ed, maintained that under Obamacare \"all policyholders are charged as if they are sick.\" The House GOP repeal bill contained provisions that \"were an attempt to alleviate the pre-existing condition problem, not exacerbate it,\" and that without the bill being passed, Republicans couldn't campaign on it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "What has changed since election night", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/qjfzVMRUzTM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The state of play in key races has shifted since election night almost one week ago, offering a different picture of where the balance of power will stand in Washington come January.\n\nDemocrats have taken the lead in a handful of key House races and in the Arizona senate race, while the margin in Florida's senate race has narrowed, forcing a recount.\n\nTwo governors' races remain undecided in Georgia and Florida.\n\nHere's a breakdown of where key races stand:\n\nHouse\n\nIn the six days since election night, Democrats picked up three House seats, while Republicans picked up one.\n\nDemocrats so far have picked up a net of 30 seats in the House of Representatives, with 10 key races still undecided.

Ron DeSantis being forced into a recount."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "What you should know about Florida's vote recount", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/IYI7IOedruI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Florida secretary of state announced Saturday afternoon that the razor-thin races for governor , senator and agriculture commissioner will be reviewed in a series of recounts which were triggered because the margins in all three contests are under .5%.\n\nAccording to unofficial results filed by the counties, Republican Gov. Rick Scott leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or about .15%. The spread in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, for a lead of .41%. In the narrowest contest, Democratic agriculture commissioner candidate Nikki Fried's advantage stands at 5,326 votes \u2014 just .06% \u2014 over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nLawsuits, Lawsuits and more lawsuits\n\nAs the counting continues, the biggest daily developments in this story will likely be the flurry of lawsuits that can and will be filed from all the campaigns. There will be a pattern. Republican lawsuits will be designed to preserve the vote totals as they currently exist, the Democrat ones will be designed to expand the pool of available votes. That is not a good vs. evil comparison. It is a one side is winning vs. one side is losing comparison. Among the ones to expect: a lawsuit of some kind to allow Palm Beach County to extend their recount beyond the Thursday deadline (Read: CNN's Gregory Krieg's piece on the deadline here ). And could Gillum, who has yet to sue anyone, finally join the fray and either file a suit on his own, or join an existing legal battle?\n\nThe PR battle is almost as important as the legal battle\n\nThese lawsuits are expensive, important and do offer up the possibility of having a tangible impact on the vote count. That impact may not be nearly as important as what it does for the public relations battle both sides are playing. Case in point: Scott's two successful lawsuits against Palm Beach and Broward County. They had no real impact on the vote total, but it does allow the Scott team to respond that both County Elections Supervisors were found to be \"violating the Constitution\" whenever anyone asks them to point to real evidence of fraud. Those cases had nothing to do with fraud. It was about releasing records that were eventually going to be released, but just a bit early. However, it certainly makes for a powerful talking point.\n\nWhat will the candidates do?\n\nYou will continue to see Scott's team use strong language to describe Nelson's role in this. \"Fraud\" & \"Steal\" will be a constant refrain. The Nelson team will continue to paint Scott as someone willfully attempting to prevent valid votes from being cast -- and even using his powers as governor to do so. (Democrats compared him to a socialist dictator Sunday night).\n\nTo keep an eye on: Will Scott go to DC next week for a photo-op with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Photo Op? His team says it is still being \"considered.\"\n\nNelson should be back in DC as the Senate resumes session. He has not been seen in public at all since the closing days of the election.\n\nAs for the gubernatorial candidates, expect DeSantis to attempt to be as far above the fray as possible. If he does anything (and we don't think he will), it will all be in a role as governor-elect. He knows his chances of losing are slim, and he has the restraint to not get in the way of things. Gillum has already made two high-profile public appearances with another one scheduled for Monday night. He is expected to make several more in the coming days. He will give a speech in Boyton Beach Monday night. This is largely to capture the captive national audience. They remain realistic (or clear-eyed) about the eventual outcome. His is of course, in search of a new job.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nIt is NOT easy to recount 8.5 million votes in this short of a window. A lot could go wrong. Already we've seen longer than expected periods of time to sort ballots and calibrate machines. Some counties will have no issues, others will struggle. There is also the chance that bins of ballots could go missing or machines could fry. All of those issues are on the table. Remember, none of that matters in the eyes of Florida law. The recount must be done by Thursday at 8 p.m. ET or the Saturday count stands.\n\nThere are a lot more voters\n\nWhy is Florida so bad at this? Didn't they figure this out after what happened 18 years ago? Some context here. First, Florida did fix these problems since 2000. The state overhauled its ballot process and machines, it set finite timelines for the completion of these tasks and made the recount laws clear and specific. But these laws were written when the expected pool of voters in Florida was around the 5 million mark. This election was at 8.5 million. It is a lot quicker and easier to recount 5 million votes than it is 8.5 million. Second, this was an extraordinarily close election. And there were three of these extraordinarily close elections. This is a perfect storm of difficulty and one even the best-run election systems would have a hard time with. Honestly, so far, despite the hyperbole and a few minor hiccups, this one has not really been that bad.\n\nWhat is the next big moment on the timeline?"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Don Lemon: Trump must be really, really rattled", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/tN1yBSbsKho/dons-take-trump-rattled-don-lemon-ctn-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Conditions are expected to persist overnight and Monday, threatening new flare-ups that could reach beyond containment lines, Osby said.\n\nHe urged those in mandatory evacuation zones to leave, warning that they can get in the way of firefighting efforts\n\n\"We must remain vigilant and not let our guard down,\" Osby said.\n\nOsby and other officials echoed Brown's sentiments about the threat of climate change.\n\nThe southern part of the state used to be able to rely on help from their counterparts up north around this time of the year, Osby said, when the threat of fire was much less prevalent in those communities. But that's no longer the case.\n\n\"And as evident by the Camp Fire in Northern California -- which is larger than this, more structures have been lost than this, more lives have been lost -- it's evident from that situation statewide that we're in climate change and it's going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Osby said.\n\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward . That leaves a lot of dry vegetation to feed fires.\n\nCrews searching for the dead\n\nCrews on the scene of both fires are combing through blackened ruins of homes. The number of dead more than doubled late Saturday, and continued to rise on Sunday.\n\nSo far, 29 bodies have been recovered in or near Paradise, a town of about 26,000 that's been all but leveled by the Camp fire. Of the six discovered Sunday, five were in homes and one was in a vehicle.\n\nOn Sunday, officials confirmed that two deaths in Malibu were related to the Woolsey Fire, bringing the statewide death toll to 31.\n\nSheriff deputies walk through a neighborhood destroyed by the Camp Fire on November 10, 2018 near Paradise, California.\n\nThe painstaking process of finding the missing and identifying the dead is challenging, with some of the bodies recovered burned beyond recognition.\n\n\"In some cases, the only remains we are able to recover are bones or bone fragments,\" Honea, the Butte County sheriff and coroner, told reporters. \"I know that members of the community who are missing loved ones are anxious, and I know that the news of us recovering bodies has to be disconcerting.\"\n\nMany bodies recovered from the Camp Fire were found inside or near homes or in vehicles, officials said.\n\nYuba County Sheriff officers carry a body away from a burned residence in Paradise, California, on November 10, 2018.\n\nHours after the fire broke out, residents fleeing Paradise became trapped in gridlock traffic as the fire closed in.

It burned through 20,000 acres in less than 14 hours on Thursday. By Monday, it had reached 113,000 acres.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties doubled in size in a 90-minute period Friday morning, to 8,000 acres. By Monday morning, it was up to more than 91,500 acres. The Hill Fire in Ventura County has torched 4,531 acres.\n\nHere's why the fires are moving so quickly:\n\nPowerful winds\n\nIn Southern California, the Santa Ana winds pushing the fires are expected to remain strong in Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said Monday.\n\nIn fact, the strongest winds for Southern California may come Tuesday and could reach near-hurricane gale force, he said.\n\nThese winds, which began in the middle of last week, may last through the end of this week.\n\nIn Northern California, the offshore winds that had been whipping the area for days are expected to die down Monday, Hennen said. The classic offshore flow was similar to the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLack of rain, dry conditions\n\nThough the drought in California has eased somewhat, all of the state is still abnormally dry, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes a lot of dry vegetation for the fires to burn.\n\nMore than half the state is in a moderate drought or worse and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nTim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said the Camp Fire is \"unique to be this late in northern California.\"\n\nNormally, a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, he said Friday at a news conference. But it hasn't rained much this fall, he said, creating \"mid-summer-like conditions.\"\n\n\"It kind of lined up perfectly to have the large 90,000-plus acre fire run we had (Thursday),\" Chavez said. \"Fuels will continue to get drier and drier and drier until we do finally get a season-ending rainfall event.\"\n\nThe terrain makes it hard for firefighters\n\nThe hills and canyons of Southern California are beautiful, but they can make it difficult for firefighters to gain access to wildfires.\n\nThe fire that broke out Friday near the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens occurred on a steep hillside that could not be accessed by firetrucks, so firefighters had to approach the fire on foot, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\n\nThe canyons can accelerate fires. They act as funnels for the wind, which pushes already heated air upward.\n\nJUST WATCHED Family prays as they drive through wildfire Replay More Videos ...

That's contributing to more days of extreme fires, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nCalFire says the 10 most destructive fires in California history have occurred since 2015. The organization has been keeping statistics for 100 years. The list does not include the Camp Fire, which would top the list.\n\nAnd a Columbia University study released in 2016 says human-induced climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires in the Western United States over the last 30 years.\n\nCalifornia's fourth climate change assessment, issued last August, said the state's forests will become more vulnerable to wildfires because of climate change.\n\nThe assessment says that by the year 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77%.\n\nThis story has been updated to give the latest acreage for the three major wildfires."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Midterm fury fuels Trump's assault on constitutional norms", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/hwqIB6BMQVg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is intensifying his challenge to constitutional constraints and governing norms that are already facing their gravest test since Watergate in the 1970s.\n\nTrump has reacted to the coming Democratic majority in the House by upping the assault on the Washington system he was elected to upend, but in a way that could be taking the nation into perilous political territory.\n\nIn the days since the fracturing of the Republican majority on power in Washington, Trump has challenged political order across a broad front.\n\nThe President has installed Matthew Whitaker, an acolyte who shares his skepticism of the Mueller probe as acting attorney general. In addition, he has stoked conspiracy theories about stolen elections in the wake of Florida's latest vote counting controversy and has threatened to use the mechanisms of government to investigate Democrats if they investigate him.\n\nAnd he has stepped up his assault on the press, including by confiscating the White House pass of CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who asked multiple, challenging questions of Trump during a White House news conference.\n\nAll of this came days after Trump used his power as commander-in-chief to dispatch troops to the border to meet what he said was an imminent criminal invasion from a migrant caravan that is yet to materialize.\n\nThe President's moves, with the prospect of more to come, have precipitated a surreal moment in politics, with Washington veterans debating whether a constitutional crisis is looming \u2014 or whether it is already here.\n\nDoes the acting AG threaten the rule of law?\n\nThe current epicenter of the debate concerns Whitaker, the former chief of staff to fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions who took his boss's job.\n\n\"He should never have been appointed and ... it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country,\" the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nGrowing questions over Whitaker's position will hike pressure on the President to swiftly nominate a permanent attorney general. But that nominee will face an inquisition from the Republican-led Senate over their positions on the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker's critics fear he will refuse to sign off on subpoenas Mueller might request, narrow the mandate of his investigation or suppress the special counsel's final report.\n\nHis appointment has raised fears that the President intends to use him to derail the Russia investigation. That is a realistic possibility since Trump already admitted in an NBC interview last year that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the investigation -- a move that critics say in itself amounts to an abuse of power and obstruction of justice.\n\nWhitaker appears unlikely to heed calls to recuse himself from the probe given a decision by Sessions to do so sparked Trump's fury and poisoned his tenure.\n\nIt may fall to the new Democratic House majority, therefore, to act as a check on any attempts by Trump to use Whitaker to interfere with Mueller, despite the President's challenge to legal norms represented by his appointment.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nThe President has frequently made claims of massive voter fraud in the United States, despite the fact that all available evidence suggests that it is not a significant problem.\n\nSo it is no surprise that he has leapt into action to proclaim that Florida's latest vote controversy is a flagrant example of Democratic larceny at the polls.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning after having spent the weekend in Paris.\n\nAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\n\nNo one is disputing the Sunshine's State's unfortunate tendency to trigger election controversy. And answers are overdue about the stewardship of elections in Broward and Palm Beach counties for instance.\n\nLawyers for Democratic and Republican candidates are now launching dueling campaigns. Each side has every right to make their case after the state's Republican secretary of state ordered recounts to begin given thin margins.\n\n\"Every vote should be counted, but, by gosh, not let fraudulent or anti-Constitutional behavior prevail,\" Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who ran the Republican Senate midterm campaign, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nBut Trump seems to be reacting not to evidence of fraud, but to vote counts that are narrowing the gap between Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum and the presumed Republican victors.\n\nThus the Florida controversy marks the latest occasion when he is prioritizing his personal interests over a President's duty to protect the nation's democracy.\n\nBut by intervening personally in the race, the President is casting doubt on the integrity of the election and potentially risking long-term damage to America's political system itself, which relies on public consent.\n\nHis furious intervention contrasts with the reaction of President Bill Clinton during an even higher-stakes confrontation in Florida, the bitterly contested recount in the 2000 presidential election, eventually handed to George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore by the Supreme Court.\n\nClinton took steps to avoid politicizing the process, reasoning that America's system depended on him staying out of it.\n\n\"I don't think I should be involved in that,\" Clinton said soon after the disputed election.\n\nTrump's intervention 18 years later is one reason why his critics fear he is oblivious or disdainful of traditional norms governing presidential behavior.\n\nLashing out at scrutiny\n\nThe Democratic capture of the House guarantees an uncomfortable period of investigation and oversight for the White House that the Republican majority deemed unnecessary during his first two years in office.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nIn the latest worrying sign for the President, top Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler told Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Democrats would examine hush payments to women who allege past affairs with Trump that may infringe campaign finance laws.\n\n\"That might very well be an impeachable offense,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump has denied the alleged affairs.\n\nThe President already reacted with fury to the notion of a new era of scrutiny from Democrats, promising a \"warlike\" posture if it took place, and hinted he could use the mechanisms of government to investigate them during a news conference last week.\n\nThe President also acted in a way many observers fear raises First Amendment questions by taking the unprecedented step of confiscating Acosta's permanent White House press pass after he questioned the President on the migrant caravan.\n\nHow deep is the crisis?\n\nEvents of the last few days point clearly to an escalating challenge by the White House to political conventions and guardrails, one that could further sharpen if Trump's reshuffle of top officials rids him of remaining restraining influences.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the President's actions have already tipped the nation into a constitutional crisis or whether the system of checks and balances has kept him on the right side of that line.\n\nAfter all, two years after he was elected, voters did decide to introduce new accountability in Washington with a Democratic House after Republicans gave no sign they were willing to rein in the President's excesses.\n\nThe courts have tempered some of Trump's most radical ideas, watering down a Muslim travel ban he authored early in his presidency. Trump's new use of executive power to limit asylum claims, in an apparent contravention of international law, will soon get its own day in court.\n\nBut political systems need to be nurtured constantly if they are to remain healthy. And the President's rhetoric on the Florida controversy especially seems to edge close to the danger zone.\n\nOne veteran observer, Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and defense secretary under President Barack Obama, believes the nation's institutions are standing firm.\n\n\"I think ultimately the institutions that our forefathers put in place are strong enough to be able to survive any administration,\" Panetta said Thursday on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nBut the fact that the question is even relevant is testimony to the darkening mood in Washington."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Republicans sharpen 'fraud' claims, Democrats compare Scott to a 'dictator' as Florida recount ramps up", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/RgDYRP8iyHY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The recount in Florida only began this weekend, but time is already bleeding away for election officials racing to meet the state's Thursday deadline to complete their work.\n\nAs volunteers rush to complete the legally mandated review, Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- who leads in his race against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson -- is again upping the stakes by suing to require law enforcement officials to seize ballots and tallying machines in Broward and Palm Beach counties during any break in the action.\n\nThe suit, which will be heard early on Monday, is part of a larger developing Republican strategy to cast the recount as an opportunity for fraudsters to hijack the election. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was not investigating anything related to the election after the Florida Department of State said there were no allegations of criminal activity.\n\nScott and President Donald Trump have alleged, without evidence, that Democrats were conspiring to overturn the initial results. The President, alleging that \"many ballots are missing or forged,\" tweeted Monday morning that \"an honest vote count is no longer possible,\" and Scott accused Nelson of trying to \"commit fraud to try to win this election.\"\n\n\"No ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from DC will be allowed to steal this election,\" Scott told Fox News on Sunday morning, shortly before he launched a trio of new lawsuits.\n\nFlorida Democrats reacted to Republican legal maneuvering by comparing Scott to a strongman striking out at the infrastructure of the vote.\n\n\"Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\" the state party said in a statement. \"The Governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\"\n\nEugene Pettis, an attorney for controversial Broward elections chief Brenda Snipes, responded to the lawsuit by insisting she had already secured the facilities.\n\n\"Dr. Snipes has taken multiple measures to make sure that the election machines and ballots are in safe keeping,\" Pettis said.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Pam Bondi is also pushing for increased law enforcement involvement in the process.\n\n\"I fail to see how the Florida Department of Law Enforcement can legitimately refuse to investigate where there is reasonable suspicion that may lead to the discovery of criminal actions in the conduct of the 2018 election,\" she wrote in a Sunday letter to the department, which has pointed to the Department of State's insistence that there is nothing to investigate.\n\nBondi also addressed the Department of State, asking the Republican-appointed secretary to dig deeper and, \"when you find any indication creating a reasonable suspicion of potential criminal activity,\" report it to the law enforcement agency.\n\nSarah Revell, the communications director for the Department of State, replied to Bondi's letter by effectively repeating what the agency has been saying for days.\n\n\"Department staff continues to observe the administration of the election in Broward County,\" Revell said. \"Our staff has not seen any evidence of criminal activity in Broward County at this time.\"\n\nNelson lawsuit\n\nNelson's campaign is also gearing up for a legal challenge that could, perhaps more than any recount, lead to a fundamental shakeup of the race. Their lawsuit, which alleges that state law requiring signatures on mail-in ballots match those on record is unconstitutional, will have a hearing in federal court on Wednesday.\n\n\"If we are successful, that will add thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted and we believe have gone uncounted in violation of the US Constitution's guarantee of the right to vote and should be counted,\" Marc Elias, Nelson's top recount lawyer, told reporters on Saturday night, adding: \"We have sought a statewide remedy because we believe that all voters -- whether they voted for Sen. Nelson or for Gov. Scott -- should not be disenfranchised because an election worker doesn't believe that their signature in two different places are closely resembling.\"\n\nMore suits are likely as the week ramps up ahead of the Thursday, 3 p.m. ET, recount deadline.\n\nThe top election official in Palm Beach County has already said it will be \"impossible\" for volunteers there to finish in time, an expectation she shares with both Republicans and Democrats on the scene to monitor the counting.\n\nPalm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett told CNN that the county's inability to meet the deadline would be \"good news for Republicans because our candidates are ahead.\"\n\n\"If they're not able to meet the deadline, the secretary of state of Florida may go ahead and certify the elections for our candidates,\" Barnett said. \"In that case, you can bet your butt there will be lawsuits filed everywhere.\"\n\nRevel confirmed Barnett's prediction later Sunday, telling CNN that if a county does not submit new figures by Thursday afternoon, \"then the results on file at that time take their place.\"\n\nFlorida governor's race\n\nSunday also marked a return to the spotlight for Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is trailing Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis as the recount kicks into gear, but revoked his concession a day earlier and plans to aggressively pursue any possible avenue -- including new legal action -- if rumors of unduly uncounted ballots persist.\n\n\"I'm not here to ask for votes. I'm not here to campaign for votes. I'm not here to make a closing argument for what it means to become the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum told supporters in Fort Lauderdale late Sunday. \"I'm simply here to say for the votes that have been cast, they ought to be counted. Every last single one of them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, DeSantis has been very careful with his public posture in the wake of the recount. He has given only one statement, a taped video announcement directed to supporters, and has not held any events or press availabilities. Late Sunday, Scott's official schedule as governor was revised to include a note that he and DeSantis met. It was described officially as a \"meeting with Gov-Elect DeSantis.\" and took place in Naples, where the two discussed the upcoming transition.\n\nTensions rising\n\nThe war of words has escalated alongside increasingly testy exchanges between demonstrators, mostly in Broward County, where Snipes has come under withering criticism by Republicans across the state.\n\nIn Broward, the recount process began at 7 a.m. Sunday with officials recalibrating the machines that count the votes and performing a series of logic and accuracy tests. After verifying that all of the machines worked and passed the tests, which took longer than planned, they began the process of separating the first page of the ballot, which contains the relevant races that need to be recounted.\n\nOfficials in Broward County now plan to work without a break until the recount is complete -- or the deadline hits.\n\nOutside of Snipes' office in Broward, a rowdy circus convened for a third straight day. A large \"Trump 2020\" banner hung from a crane attached to a truck over the protest zone, and \"Bikers for Trump\" signs mixed in with demonstrators in the colors of the four ticket-topping candidates.\n\nLater in the afternoon, pro-DeSantis and Trump protesters pounced and shouted \"fake news, fake ballots\" and \"only count legal votes\" when reporters with cameras began to prep for remarks by Democratic state Sen. Perry Thurston.

That he chose to run a series of national ads to do so shouldn't be lost on anyone. Bloomberg sees himself as a national figure and has always been desirous of a national platform. That desire, coupled with his party switch (he's a Democrat again) and his massive personal wealth, all suggest that Bloomberg is dead serious about running. The question is whether he -- a white guy from NYC -- is what the party is pining for.\n\n10. Beto O'Rourke: One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has : One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has historically been very skeptical of the now-failed Senate candidate. Sometimes, though, out of the ashes of failure rises success. O'Rourke came the closest for a Texas Democrat to winning a Senate race in a generation. He only lost to Ted Cruz by less than 3 points . O'Rourke did so as an unabashed liberal who inspired millions of Democrats across the country. Importantly, he proved be a tireless worker, which could serve him well on the presidential campaign trail. Still, O'Rourke lost in 2018, was just a three-term member of the House and is man running in a party becoming dominated by women. We're more than just a little skeptical.\n\n9. Sherrod Brown: On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018. He represents a state that President Donald Trump won by 9 points in 2016, and Republicans recruited a credible challenger -- Rep. Jim Renacci -- into the race against him. It didn't work out that way, as Brown cruised to a win even as some of his fellow Democrats in states Trump carried were losing on Tuesday night. : On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018.

The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited : Some politicians are coy about running. The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited Iowa multiple times and New Hampshire as well. But showing signs of running isn't enough to get you on this list. One thing we like about Bullock is he has a lane that doesn't seem overly crowded ... yet. He's the outsider western governor in a party that is becoming more dominated by urbanites. That also means that his natural base within the party is very small. One other problem for Bullock is that most people have no clue who he is. In a crowded field, he may get buried before he ever has a chance to shine.\n\n7. Julian Castro: Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Castro told Rolling Stone recently . \"I have a strong vision for the country.\" Given the rising influence of Hispanic voters within the Democratic coalition and Castro's proven star power -- his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention was a tour de force of political oratory -- he's someone to keep an eye on.\n\n6. Bernie Sanders: The case for Sanders remains as obvious as it ever was.

He came in second in the 2016 presidential primary, maintains a high favorable rating with Democrats and he's quite progressive in a party moving to the left. Yet, it seems like his moment may have passed . Sanders placed a distant second in CNN's October poll on the Democratic primary , despite high name recognition. There's no sign that he has solved his problem of attracting black voters. Additionally, Sanders might be a victim of his own success. There will likely be other Democrats running this time around who are outsiders (such as Bullock) or are very liberal (such as Harris).\n\n5.

On a trip through Iowa (DING) last month to stump for candidates up and down the Hawkeye State ballot (DING DING), he said this: \"This might be the Midwest, I grew up in the Northeast, but folk are folk.\" (DING DING DING). Folk are folk! Booker has been somewhat outshined as the rising star within the changing Democratic Party by Harris, but he is a gifted orator and someone who seems to want it badly. Both of which matter in the grind of a presidential primary.\n\n4. Amy Klobuchar: A lot of people will disagree with putting the Minnesota senator this high on the list, but hear us out. Democrats are desperate to win back the Midwest. If they are, then doesn't it make sense to nominate someone who just won reelection to the Senate from a key Midwestern state by 24 points.

What does Klobuchar offer the base? She gives them a calm but prosecutorial demeanor that she could use to fight Trump. That served her well during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings . Not being a fire-breathing liberal could hurt her in the primary, however.\n\n3.

In the final days of the 2018 campaign, Biden, hoarse from shouting, held 12 rallies for Democratic candidates -- uttering classic Bidenisms like \"It's time to get up. Remember who in the hell we are. This is America.\" So why isn't Biden at the top of our rankings? Because he's in his mid-70s, is a white male and has spent his entire adult life in politics. It's not clear to us that profile sells in this coming Democratic primary.\n\n2.

They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 44 homes and six other locations and found lead levels were at the legal limit. It wasn't enough to sound alarm bells.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Vitamin D, omega-3 supplements do not prevent cancer or heart disease, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Naj9wr7EC9U/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements do not prevent cancer or heart disease, a new study finds, the latest in the years-long debate over their benefits.\n\nThe trial enrolled more than 25,000 Americans of various ethnicities who were over the age of 50 and had no history of cancer, heart attack, stroke or other forms of heart disease.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned a daily dose of vitamin D, omega-3 or a placebo. After more than five years, no significant heart disease or cancer difference was seen between those taking supplements and those taking a placebo.\n\nLead researcher Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medincine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the study distinguishes itself because it is the world's largest randomized trial of its kind.\n\nPrevious research has looked at bone health or used high-risk populations, she added, but her study had the \"the primary aims to look if vitamin D and omega-3 could reduce risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease\" in typical people with no history of such conditions.\n\nThe results of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL -- known as VITAL -- were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago and published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nVITAL's initial trial took place last year and included more than 8,000 participants.\n\nResearch has suggested that the fatty acid omega-3 could prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases, the study says, and vitamin D has been suggested to reduce cancer risks because there are fewer cancer cases in countries with high sun exposure. Such observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors for a lower cancer rate in places where there is greater sun exposure, because people who spend more time outside are most likely also engaging in other healthy habits such as exercise.\n\n\"If you're already taking one or both of these supplements, there's no clear reason to stop. If you want to consider starting, our recommendation is to talk with your health care provider, but this does not need to be done on an urgent basis,\" Manson said.\n\nLittle protection from vitamin D\n\nThe study was a large clinical randomized trial, noted Brian Power, honorary senior dietitian at University College London Hospital and lecturer in nutrition who was not involved in the research. He described it in an email as \"the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness of interventions of this sort; bias and confounding are reduced.\"\n\nLooking at moderate to high dosages of 2,000 IU of vitamin D, 1,617 people developed cancer; of these, 793 were regular vitamin D takers, and 824 were in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, 905 participants developed major cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart attack or death from cardiovascular disease. Of them, 396 were taking vitamin D supplements daily; the placebo group had 409 cases of a major cardiovascular event.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the difference is too small and says there is no link between vitamin D and a lowered risk of major cardiovascular events or invasive cancers.\n\nAnastasia Z. Kalea, senior lecturer at the Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics at University College London who was not part of the study, said the results are \"very important but not surprising.\" Both conclusions were suspected, and the trial supports them, she added.\n\nThe study shows that it is not possible for vitamin D supplements to prevent cancer, and the differences in the placebo and vitamin D groups are minimal, Kalea said.\n\nHowever, over the course of the study, deaths from cancer were significantly reduced, by 25% for those who took vitamin D supplements. This finding needs further research, but Manson thinks it can be explained with vitamin D affecting tumor biology, making it less likely that the tumor grows and spreads.\n\nRecent research also disproved the theory that vitamin D improves bone health and prevents fractures, but some experts disagree with this, citing small time periods and sample sizes as well as insufficient dosages.\n\nSome benefit from omega-3\n\nIn the omega-3 analysis, invasive cancers were found in 820 participants taking daily supplements of 1 gram of omega-3 and in 797 who received a placebo.\n\nAlso, 386 people taking 1 gram of omega-3 experienced cardiovascular events during the study, as did 419 people taking a placebo.\n\nBut for heart attacks specifically, findings showed an overall 28% reduction in those taking omega-3 supplements. For African-Americans, the study found a 77% reduction in heart attacks linked to daily of omega-3 supplements.\n\nIn people who don't eat the recommended one or two servings of fish a week, the supplements were linked to a 40% reduction in heart attacks. But for people who followed the recommendation, there was no such association.\n\nManson recommends trying to get omega-3 from a healthy diet that incorporates fish. But people who don't eat or don't like fish should talk to a health care professional about the option of omega-3 supplements.\n\n\"It could be a chance finding,\" Manson said, and thus it needs to be replicated. But if confirmed this could point to a \"promising approach to reducing health disparity.\"\n\nNathan Davies, lead for the Clinical Nutrition and Public Health program at University College London, said these findings are not \"radical findings by any means. There could be benefits there, but they are not as clear-cut.\"\n\nThe findings show that omega-3 oils are not harmful, added Davies, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHowever, he noted that the study could have benefited from longer duration. \"You always want an even longer duration, especially if you are looking at cancer.\"\n\nIt also doesn't analyze whether there is a dose dependency effect and a higher dose could lead to better results, Davies said.\n\n\"Diet is more important than supplementation.

He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "National Action trial: Three guilty of neo-Nazi group membership", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-46151838", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright West Mids Police Image caption Claudia Patatas and Adam Thomas named their baby Adolf out of \"admiration\" for Hitler\n\nA couple who named their baby after Adolf Hitler have been found guilty of being members of a banned terrorist group.\n\nAdam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, from Banbury, along with Daniel Bogunovic, 27, from Leicester, were convicted of being in National Action.\n\nBirmingham Crown Court heard the couple gave their child the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader.\n\nJurors saw images of Thomas in Ku Klux Klan robes while cradling his baby.\n\nThe Neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.\n\n'White supremacy'\n\nProsecutors said the Midlands chapter of the group \"shed one skin for another\" and \"rebranded\" after being banned.\n\nThey said the case was about \"a specific type of terror... born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy\".\n\nThomas told the court that the pictures showing him wearing KKK clothing were \"just play\", but he admitted being a racist.\n\nThomas was also found guilty of having a copy of terrorist manual the Anarchist Cookbook.\n\nImage copyright West Mids Police Image caption Daniel Bogunovic, Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas stayed in National Action after it was banned\n\nThomas and Patatas had two machetes, one with a serrated 18in (46cm) blade, in the bedroom where their baby son slept.\n\nA police search of their home in January also found one of two crossbows just a few feet from the baby's crib, the jury was told.\n\nAlso found was a pastry cutter shaped like a swastika in a kitchen drawer, as well as pendants, flags and clothing emblazoned with symbols of the Nazi-era SS and National Action.\n\nBarnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said a deleted Skype log was recovered from Thomas's laptop.\n\nHe said the messages sent between two parties spoke of National Action being \"destroyed\", with its leaders agreeing to disband with \"no attempt at revival\".\n\nNational Action\n\nThe group was founded in 2013 by Ben Raymond, now 29, and Alex Davies, now 24\n\nIt was intended to be an explicitly neo-Nazi party\n\nRaymond was a politics graduate from the University of Essex, and Davies was a Welsh former member of the British National Party\n\nNational Action shunned democratic politics, regarding itself instead as a youth-based street movement\n\nIt is believed it never had more than 100 members\n\nIts activities involved leafleting university campuses, aggressive publicity stunts and city-centre demonstrations\n\nIn 2015, 25-year-old member Zack Davies used a hammer and machete to attack a Sikh dentist and was jailed for attempted murder\n\nAfter the murder of Jo Cox in 2016, an official National Action Twitter account posted: \"Only 649 MPs to go #WhiteJihad\"\n\nThe group was banned later that year after the government concluded it was \"concerned in terrorism\"\n\nIt became the first far-right group to be proscribed in this country since World War Two\n\nReading from the log, Mr Jameson said: \"But the Midlands branch of NA, which is just 17-20 of us, have decided to ignore this and we've renamed ourselves the Thule Combat League.\n\n\"Traitors.

They put me in a room on my own, I was in isolation,\" says Casey, 16.\n\nMore than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year, a BBC News investigation has learned.\n\nCasey's school disputes the length of time he spent on his own and said he was \"regularly disruptive\".\n\nThe teenager says he was placed on his own after he contracted fibromyalgia.\n\nHe takes the painkiller Tramadol for the chronic pain condition.\n\nMore than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage.\n\nDozens of them had education, health and care plans (EHCPs) provided for children with complex needs.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says school isolation can be \"distressing and degrading\" and she is concerned it is being used \"as a gateway to excluding and off-rolling\", where pupils are removed from a school's register.\n\nThe Department for Education says children should be in isolation no longer than is necessary and that the health, safety and welfare of pupils must always be put first.\n\nCasey's father died when he was nine and he lives with his grandmother in Bristol.\n\n\"I was quite athletic, I was happy, then I fell ill. That's when it all went downhill.\"\n\nHe says he didn't learn during the isolation period and spent much of his time copying out of GCSE revision books, often without a teacher present.\n\n\"It made me feel there was no point to learning,\" he said.\n\nCasey says the experience has had a lasting impact on him.\n\n\"I locked myself into my room every day after I came home and shut the blinds,\" he said.\n\n\"It felt like being isolated was normal. I wouldn't expect them to treat a dog like that. It was just vile.\"\n\nCasey's school says the room he was in was not the school's actual isolation facility.\n\nIn a statement, it said that schools were increasingly encountering pupils \"in crisis\" who are being \"failed by a combination of public services\".\n\nWhat is school isolation?\n\nIsolation rooms, or internal inclusion units, are facilities pupils are sent to when it is thought they need to be removed from a classroom during the school day.\n\nThey vary in their nature significantly. Many include so-called isolation or consequence booths - partitioned desks in which children typically face the wall and work in silence.\n\nOccasionally schools use \"seclusion\" units - rooms where children sometimes remain on their own - while others place pupils in more conventional classrooms to work in silence.\n\nA recent government report on alternative provision said that schools with internal inclusion units saw them as a halfway point between excluding a pupil and keeping them in a mainstream classroom.\n\nImage caption Isolation booths used in a primary school\n\nHow are isolation rooms being used?\n\nThe BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to more than 1,000 secondary schools and academy chains across the UK asking how they use isolation and around 600 responded.\n\nIt learned that more than 200 schools in England used isolation booths, with 12 in Wales and six in Scotland but none in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile the majority had rules for children spending a maximum of one, two or three continuous days in isolation, 225 pupils in England and one in Wales spent a whole week in isolation booths as a single punishment last year.\n\nThe investigation also learned:\n\nmore than 5,000 pupils with special educational needs in England spent time in isolation\n\nchildren with autism and ADHD have attended isolation\n\none school had five separate isolation rooms, each permanently staffed at an annual cost of more than \u00a3170,000\n\nsome schools prevent pupils from using the playground during the day and the dining hall at lunch\n\ntwo schools - which included a bathroom as part of the facility - do not allow pupils to leave the unit all day.\n\nImage caption A seclusion room used in a primary school\n\nWhat rules are there for using them?\n\nGovernment guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there \"no longer than is necessary\".\n\nThe guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be \"reasonable\" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account.\n\nSchools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do.\n\nImage caption A pupil sitting in an isolation booth\n\nPaul Dix says he has probably visited more isolation facilities than anyone else in his work as a behavioural consultant in schools across England.\n\nHe says he has seen 50 children at one time in isolation in one school and children with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD in isolation rooms and met one child who said they had spent 36 days in isolation in one school year.\n\n\"That is not education, it is a custodial sentence,\" he said.\n\n\"Where's the regulation around it, where's the reporting, where is the accountability?\"\n\nHe said he has heard of pupils being placed into isolation for not bringing a pen or wearing the right shoes.\n\nPaul says disruptive pupils may need to be removed from classrooms but believes they should be returned after a short period and a discussion of their behaviour with an experienced teacher.\n\n\"That is the intelligent way. Isolation is desperation,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Isolation booths are used in hundreds of schools in England\n\nWhy are they used?\n\nRichard Sheriff is the executive head for eight schools - three of which have rooms with isolation booths - as well as president of the Association of School and College Leaders.\n\nHe says his schools would never place pupils in isolation booths for five consecutive days, but understands why some schools feel the need to find ways of tackling extreme behaviour.\n\n\"There is a gathering storm with regards to student behaviour,\" he says.\n\n\"We've seen cuts in services in local authorities, but also in the ability of schools to purchase well-run, good quality alternative provision.\"\n\nHe says a lot of society's problems are now being \"laid at the door of schools\".\n\nImage caption Richard Sheriff is executive head of three schools which use isolation\n\nThe government's school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, says isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms.\n\n\"When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,\" he said.\n\nHe believes removing students from classrooms should be seen as a positive solution.\n\n\"It can be a way of preventing fixed-term exclusions by keeping them in the school and being looked after,\" he said.\n\nYou can follow Noel Titheradge on Twitter at @NoelTitheradge\n\nHas your child spent long periods in school isolation?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018 Report\n\nWhat is the latest on the Camp Fire?\n\nEmergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise.\n\nThe town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday.\n\nAt a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle.\n\nHe said that at least 228 people were still unaccounted for, adding that DNA testing equipment was being sent should it be required to help identify victims.\n\nThe mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, gave the BBC an update on the situation in the town.\n\n\"Most of the residential [area] is gone. I would say 90%,\" she said. \"I had an opportunity to go up there and take a look for myself. Just about everyone I know lost their home.\"\n\nThe fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest.\n\nIt has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said.\n\n\"Containment\" refers to a physical barrier around a fire that stops it spreading - such as a river, or a shallow, 10ft(3m)-wide trench dug by fire crews. If a fire is 100% contained, this means it has containment lines around its whole perimeter. However - the fire may still burn for days or weeks to follow.\n\nPolice said suspected looters were arrested in Paradise on Saturday, and may have been trying to impersonate Forest Service workers.\n\nWhat about the Woolsey Fire?\n\nThe blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles.\n\nIt has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fleeing through flames: \"I'm so scared right now... so terrified\"\n\nLooting was also reported in the southern fire area over the weekend.\n\nLuxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames.\n\nHollywood actor Gerard Butler shared a picture of a charred house on Twitter, writing: \"Returned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California.\" He thanked firefighters for their \"courage, spirit and sacrifice\".\n\nParamount Ranch in Agoura Hills, where the HBO series Westworld is filmed, was also destroyed.\n\nOn Saturday, firefighters used a respite from strong winds to drop fire retardant in a bid to strengthen firebreaks.\n\nBut officials warned that winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) are expected over the coming days, meaning fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly.\n\n\"Winds are already blowing.

But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round.\n\nThe current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions.\n\nLow humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.\n\nThe state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited\n\nAnd then there's climate change.

It was that every day. Every single day. They put me in a room on my own, I was in isolation,\" says Casey, 16.\n\nMore than 200 pupils spent at least five straight days in isolation booths in schools in England last year, a BBC News investigation has learned.\n\nCasey's school disputes the length of time he spent on his own and said he was \"regularly disruptive\".\n\nThe teenager says he was placed on his own after he contracted fibromyalgia.\n\nHe takes the painkiller Tramadol for the chronic pain condition.\n\nMore than 5,000 children with special educational needs also attended isolation rooms at some stage.\n\nDozens of them had education, health and care plans (EHCPs) provided for children with complex needs.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says school isolation can be \"distressing and degrading\" and she is concerned it is being used \"as a gateway to excluding and off-rolling\", where pupils are removed from a school's register.\n\nThe Department for Education says children should be in isolation no longer than is necessary and that the health, safety and welfare of pupils must always be put first.\n\nCasey's father died when he was nine and he lives with his grandmother in Bristol.\n\n\"I was quite athletic, I was happy, then I fell ill. That's when it all went downhill.\"\n\nHe says he didn't learn during the isolation period and spent much of his time copying out of GCSE revision books, often without a teacher present.\n\n\"It made me feel there was no point to learning,\" he said.\n\nCasey says the experience has had a lasting impact on him.\n\n\"I locked myself into my room every day after I came home and shut the blinds,\" he said.\n\n\"It felt like being isolated was normal. I wouldn't expect them to treat a dog like that. It was just vile.\"\n\nCasey's school says the room he was in was not the school's actual isolation facility.\n\nIn a statement, it said that schools were increasingly encountering pupils \"in crisis\" who are being \"failed by a combination of public services\".\n\nWhat is school isolation?\n\nIsolation rooms, or internal inclusion units, are facilities pupils are sent to when it is thought they need to be removed from a classroom during the school day.\n\nThey vary in their nature significantly. Many include so-called isolation or consequence booths - partitioned desks in which children typically face the wall and work in silence.\n\nOccasionally schools use \"seclusion\" units - rooms where children sometimes remain on their own - while others place pupils in more conventional classrooms to work in silence.\n\nA recent government report on alternative provision said that schools with internal inclusion units saw them as a halfway point between excluding a pupil and keeping them in a mainstream classroom.\n\nImage caption Isolation booths used in a primary school\n\nHow are isolation rooms being used?\n\nThe BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to more than 1,000 secondary schools and academy chains across the UK asking how they use isolation and around 600 responded.\n\nIt learned that more than 200 schools in England used isolation booths, with 12 in Wales and six in Scotland but none in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile the majority had rules for children spending a maximum of one, two or three continuous days in isolation, 225 pupils in England and one in Wales spent a whole week in isolation booths as a single punishment last year.\n\nThe investigation also learned:\n\nmore than 5,000 pupils with special educational needs in England spent time in isolation\n\nchildren with autism and ADHD have attended isolation\n\none school had five separate isolation rooms, each permanently staffed at an annual cost of more than \u00a3170,000\n\nsome schools prevent pupils from using the playground during the day and the dining hall at lunch\n\ntwo schools - which included a bathroom as part of the facility - do not allow pupils to leave the unit all day.\n\nImage caption A seclusion room used in a primary school\n\nWhat rules are there for using them?\n\nGovernment guidance in England says schools are free to decide how long pupils should be kept in isolation, but they should be there \"no longer than is necessary\".\n\nThe guidelines also say that in order for isolation to be lawful as a punishment it should be \"reasonable\" in all circumstances, and factors such as special educational needs should be taken into account.\n\nSchools do not need to record use or report to parents that their child has been sent to isolation, although many do.\n\nImage caption A pupil sitting in an isolation booth\n\nPaul Dix says he has probably visited more isolation facilities than anyone else in his work as a behavioural consultant in schools across England.\n\nHe says he has seen 50 children at one time in isolation in one school and children with Asperger's syndrome and ADHD in isolation rooms and met one child who said they had spent 36 days in isolation in one school year.\n\n\"That is not education, it is a custodial sentence,\" he said.\n\n\"Where's the regulation around it, where's the reporting, where is the accountability?\"\n\nHe said he has heard of pupils being placed into isolation for not bringing a pen or wearing the right shoes.\n\nPaul says disruptive pupils may need to be removed from classrooms but believes they should be returned after a short period and a discussion of their behaviour with an experienced teacher.\n\n\"That is the intelligent way. Isolation is desperation,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Isolation booths are used in hundreds of schools in England\n\nWhy are they used?\n\nRichard Sheriff is the executive head for eight schools - three of which have rooms with isolation booths - as well as president of the Association of School and College Leaders.\n\nHe says his schools would never place pupils in isolation booths for five consecutive days, but understands why some schools feel the need to find ways of tackling extreme behaviour.\n\n\"There is a gathering storm with regards to student behaviour,\" he says.\n\n\"We've seen cuts in services in local authorities, but also in the ability of schools to purchase well-run, good quality alternative provision.\"\n\nHe says a lot of society's problems are now being \"laid at the door of schools\".\n\nImage caption Richard Sheriff is executive head of three schools which use isolation\n\nThe government's school behaviour expert, Tom Bennett, says isolation rooms can be effective in tackling disruption in classrooms.\n\n\"When you're a lone adult with a class of 25 pupils, it only take two people to really persistently wilfully misbehave for that lesson to be completely detonated,\" he said.\n\nHe believes removing students from classrooms should be seen as a positive solution.\n\n\"It can be a way of preventing fixed-term exclusions by keeping them in the school and being looked after,\" he said.\n\nYou can follow Noel Titheradge on Twitter at @NoelTitheradge\n\nHas your child spent long periods in school isolation?

They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nMr Eustice had said: \"Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.\"\n\nHowever, the APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, \"these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle\".\n\nWeight of science\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nOn 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: \"The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.\"\n\nThe department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset.\n\nDr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.\n\n\"Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.\"\n\nIn response, a Defra statement said: \"The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.\n\n\"Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nDr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed.\n\nOn Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness \"lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation\".\n\nBut two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.\n\nJan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.\n\nShe said: \"Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers.\n\n\"Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.\"\n\nDefra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: \"This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.\"\n\nMedia access\n\nMuch of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey.\n\nDefra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.\n\nA spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFormer Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: \"When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nDefra responded: \"Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.\n\n\"As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change protests leads to '22 arrests' over blockade", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46172661", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Protesters lay chained together on the pavement outside the UK government's energy department\n\nEnvironment activists who have blockaded the UK's energy department in London say 22 people have been arrested during the protest.\n\nThe Met Police confirmed at least eight protestors have been detained.\n\nThe UK is seen as a leader in policies to reduce greenhouse gases and will soon be considering tougher targets.\n\nBut the protesters say research suggests the chance of keeping the global temperature rise under a 2C danger threshold is just one in 20.\n\nThe demonstrators blocked entry to the offices by lying chained together on the pavement, while some glued themselves to the doors of the department building.\n\nFurther protests are planned through the week and the demonstrators believe the public will take them seriously, as they are willing to go to jail for their cause.\n\nImage caption Some demonstrators also glued themselves to the door of the building\n\nThey compare themselves with the suffragettes, the anti-apartheid movement, the followers of Gandhi, and the US civil rights movement, although their critics point out that these groups didn't have the vote.\n\nThey have declared Saturday as Extinction Rebellion Day \u2013 the day they\u2019ll commit acts of civil disobedience in the hope of jolting governments round the world into stronger action.\n\nWhy are they happy to be arrested?\n\nImage caption Gail Bradbrook says she wants to protect the planet for her children's sake\n\nOne of the protesters, Gail Bradbrook - a mother of two from Stroud - said: \u201cI want the planet protected for my children.\n\n\u201cChange comes when people are willing to commit acts of peaceful civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cFifty people in jail for a short time is likely to bring the ecological crisis into the public consciousness.\u201d\n\nThe first mass meeting of the organisation last month drew 1,000 people to Westminster and blocked roads for two hours.

However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas.

Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Friends Excitedly Gather Around Man\u2019s Phone To Watch Shaky Footage Of Concert", "article_link": "https://local.theonion.com/friends-excitedly-gather-around-man-s-phone-to-watch-sh-1830386986", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "CHICAGO\u2014Exclaiming and pushing past each other as they jockeyed for a clear view of the screen, friends of local man Carl Michaels excitedly gathered around his phone Monday to watch the shaky footage he had recorded of a recent Mt.

Members of the Stanford team said they could tell which island a Darwin was from simply by studying the shape and thickness of its mutton chops.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe breathtaking diversity of Charles Darwin we see in the Gal\u00e1pagos is the result of each species having adapted to survive in different environments,\u201d said head researcher Dr. Robert Colletti, citing the example of a cold-blooded, 6-inch-long scaly Darwin that can fit into small holes on the sides of volcanic cliffs. \u201cWe see Darwins of every conceivable sort, like an avian Darwin with a sophisticated vocal mechanism that allows it to mimic observations about natural history, or a bright pink, feathered Darwin that stands on long legs in shallow water and gets its color from the massive quantity of brine shrimp it consumes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOur analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago,\u201d Colletti added. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely remarkable.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ecologists explained that the proliferation of Charles Darwin in the Gal\u00e1pagos began with a now-extinct mammalian species, which at one time roamed the islands foraging for specimens of flora and fauna it could collect, place into categories according to their physical characteristics, and then carefully label before sending off to Cambridge University for expert analysis by contemporary naturalists.\n\n\n\nAs time passed, many highly adaptive traits appear to have emerged in its descendants, such as the thin, nimble talons that allowed one species of Darwin to examine the physiology of earthworms and determine its effects upon the soil before going on to write a popular book on the subject. Another remarkable adaptation can reportedly be observed in the still-extant citron-crowned Darwin, which displays its brilliantly colored bald spot during its courtship dance to woo sexual partners with its presumed virility.\n\n\n\nAccording to Colletti and his team, most Charles Darwins are now vanishingly rare, as are many of the species that depend upon them, including a critically endangered orchid that can only be pollinated by one uniquely adapted Darwin with a 12-inch-long proboscis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe must act quickly if we wish to save the Darwins,\u201d said Colletti, expressing concern about the potential overfishing of aquatic Darwins, which he worried would be traded as exotic pets or sold as meat. \u201cThroughout the Gal\u00e1pagos, invasive species represent a real threat: Darwins are unable to compete for scarce water with large land mammals such as cattle and donkeys. And even the fittest Darwins, unfortunately, are unable fend off attacks from the feral pigs that now roam the islands.\u201d\n\n\n\nThough scientists cannot be certain what caused the sudden explosion of divergent Darwin species 200 years ago, they have noted that newly unearthed journals of the British naturalist Charles Darwin describe in detail the many nights he spent alone in the Gal\u00e1pagos longing for the intimate embrace of another.\n\n"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Trump Hacks Through Thick Central American Jungle In Search Of Entirely New Ethnic Group To Demonize", "article_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/trump-hacks-through-thick-central-american-jungle-in-se-1830384914", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "TALAMANCAN MONTANE FORESTS, COSTA RICA\u2014Venturing deep into rainforest no outsider has dared explore, President Trump slashed through the thick vines of a Central American jungle Monday in search of a previously unknown ethnic group to vilify. \u201cLegend has it that this land is home to a lost race of people living in complete isolation, and if I can manage to find them, I will be able to stereotype them in any way I choose,\u201d said the machete-wielding commander in chief who was wearing a tan field jacket as he led a group of loyal Republican allies through the oppressively hot and humid thicket in search of the mythic tribe. \u201cThis discovery could change everything.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center,

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

But people familiar with the talks said this week that Long Island City and Crystal City have emerged as front runners for the ``HQ2'' project and its total of 50,000 jobs.\n\n\n\nA look at two communities said to be at the top of Amazon's list.\n\n\n\nLong Island City\n\n\n\nIt's already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation's most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\n\n\nIf chosen, the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City's reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon would also cement Long Island City's transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\"I joke that we're experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\" says Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\n\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\n\n\nDays before the potential Amazon news emerged, the city announced a $180 million plan to address Long Island City's packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, says area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\n\n\"I know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can't just be good for Amazon,\" says van Bramer, a Democrat.\n\n\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\n\n\nThe neighborhood's rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \"Sex and the City,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"The Sopranos'' have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\n\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area's growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\n\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\n\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\n\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC .

The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\n\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\n\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\n\n\nCrystal City is populated by `70s and `80s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\n\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, who faces a black Democratic challenger in a Nov. 27 runoff, said Sunday that her Nov. 2 remark was \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" for someone who invited her to speak, and \"any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\"\n\nMississippi has a bitter history of racially motivated lynchings of black people. The NAACP website says that between 1882 and 1968, there were 4,743 lynchings in the United States, and nearly 73 percent of the victims were black. It says Mississippi had 581 during that time, the most of any state.\n\nHyde-Smith is challenged by former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary Mike Espy.\n\n\"Cindy Hyde-Smith's comments are reprehensible,\" Espy campaign spokesman Danny Blanton said in a statement Sunday. \"They have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country. We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\"\n\nThe video was shot in Tupelo, in front of a statue of Elvis Presley, who was born in the city in northeastern Mississippi. It shows a small group of white people clapping politely for Hyde-Smith after a fellow cattle rancher introduced her.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to temporarily succeed Cochran, who retired amid health concerns in April. She will serve until the special election is resolved.\n\nHyde-Smith and Espy each received about 41 percent of the vote in a four-person race Tuesday to advance to the runoff. The winner gets the final two years of a term started by longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.\n\nEspy in 1986 became the first African-American since Reconstruction to win a U.S. House seat in Mississippi, and if he defeats Hyde-Smith, he would be the first African-American since Reconstruction to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, and after being appointed is trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state.\n\nLamar White Jr., publisher of a left-leaning Louisiana news site called The Bayou Brief, posted the video Sunday on social media. White told The Associated Press he received the video late Saturday from \"a very reliable, trusted source,\" but he would not reveal the person's name. He said that source received it from the person who shot the video.\n\nWhite said he believes he received the video because he has been writing about racism in the South for about a dozen years.\n\n\"There's no excuse to say what she said,\" White said of Hyde-Smith.\n\nThe national NAACP president Derrick Johnson, who is from Mississippi, said Hyde-Smith's comment shows a lack of judgment.\n\n\"Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith's shameful remarks prove once again how Trump has created a social and political climate that normalizes hateful and racist rhetoric,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Hyde-Smith's decision to joke about 'hanging,' in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African Americans, is sick. To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people, Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful.\"\n\nA Republican activist who initially supported another candidate in the special U.S. Senate election said he will vote for Hyde-Smith in the runoff, even though he considers her a weak candidate.\n\n\"That comment about `a public hanging' is much ado about nothing,\" said Scott Brewster of Brandon, who is white. \"She's not very smart and made a tone-deaf comment. It doesn't make her a racist.\"\n\nA Republican state lawmaker in Mississippi, Rep.

Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters.\n\nThe developments make this a tumultuous political moment in Florida. This recount process is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren't aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nIn Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to accuse Broward's supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, of \"incompetence and gross mismanagement.\"\n\nBroward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He's seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots \"when not in use until such time as any recounts.\" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law.\n\nThe court didn't immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate.\n\nJuan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of \"using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn't think her department could meet Thursday's deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there.\n\nThe recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday.\n\nUnofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor's contest. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered.\n\nRepublicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on.\n\nGillum and Nelson insist that each vote should be counted and the process should take its course.\n\nScott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer's objection of Palm Beach County's rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen.\n\n\"He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told Fox News. \"Bill Nelson's a sore loser. He's been in politics way too long.\"\n\nNelson's campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn't authorized to object to the ballot's rejection, as \"Non-citizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\"\n\nGillum appeared Sunday evening at a predominantly African-American church in Fort Lauderdale, declaring that voter disenfranchisement isn't just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that \"a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void.\"\n\nBoth the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nThat didn't stop protests outside Snipes' office, where a mostly Republican crowd gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting \"lock her up,\" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts. One protester wore a Hillary Clinton mask.\n\nRegistered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, \"I'm not here for Trump! I'm here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!\" He said the office's problems \"don't make me feel very much like my vote counted.\"\n\nFlorida also is conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida's three Cabinet seats.\n\nFor some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nMuch has changed since then.\n\nIn 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards - voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn't fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians.\n\nNow the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate's name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test, and the process for recounts is clearly spelled out."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Back from Paris, Trump Assails Europe on Defense, Trade", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/back-from-paris-trump-assails-europe-on-defense-and-trade/4654826.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump, back in Washington Monday after commemorating the centenary of the end of World War I in Paris, immediately assailed Europe for its defense spending and trade surplus over the United States.\n\nTrump, in a string of Twitter comments, said \"much was accomplished\" in his meetings with other world leaders.

In the real world, healers and midwives also used creepy-named plants for medicinal purposes, and they didn't need to visit Hogwarts to get them. They could be purchased at an ordinary apothecary (a pharmacy or drugstore).\n\nToday, one of the best preserved apothecaries in the United States has been turned into a museum in historic Alexandria, Virginia, and provides a fascinating glimpse of medicines before the days of antibiotics and modern drugs.\n\nFor more than 140 years, from 1792 to 1933, the family-owned Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary served customers with an amazing assortment of medicines. When the shop closed down, the new owner kept it just the way it was and turned it into a museum.\n\nThe apothecary usually provided remedies \"for minor ailments, rashes, the flu, or a headache,\" explained Lauren Gleason, manager of the museum.\n\nCurator Callie Stapp oversees the intriguing collection of thousands of objects, most in excellent condition. They include weighing scales, weird bloodletting tools, and cobalt glass bottles that stored poisonous liquids.\n\n\"The apothecary is so much the same that if the owners were still alive today they would feel at home in it,\" she said.\n\nFamous patrons\n\n\n\nThe shop serviced famous clients, including President George Washington and his wife Martha, who had items delivered to their nearby Mount Vernon estate. The museum even has a note written by Mrs. Washington, requesting the delivery of castor oil, which was used as a laxative.\n\n\n\nLike a modern drugstore, the apothecary sold more than medicine.\n\n\"Lots of other chemicals like paints, dyes and perfumes, would have been made and sold here,\" said Gleason. But \"other items like sewing machines, pens, razors and baby bottles were sold here as well.\"\n\nThe store's original gleaming white shelves hold dozens of clear hand-blown glass bottles for liquids, labeled in gold leaf.\n\n\"These bottles have probably been part of this pharmacy's collection since the 1850s,\" Gleason explained. \"The various concoctions helped with things like coughing, an upset stomach and kidney disease.\"\n\nRemnants of the past\n\n\n\nA number of the bottles have traces of residue from the ingredients. Others, amazingly, still contain liquids that go back decades, including cinnamon for nausea, iodine, an antiseptic, and opium, which is derived from the poppy flower.\n\n\"Opium was a very effective pain killer, and it would often be used to treat the flu or dysentery,\" Gleason said. \"And it would have even been used to treat depression, though we know today it would not have been helpful.\"\n\nA dimly-lit upstairs room looks like something out of a Harry Potter movie, with its old wooden boxes and drawers for storing herbs and other botanicals.\n\nDragon's Blood is hand-written on one of the drawers. It supposedly comes from dragons and is used to make potions in the wizardly world. But Dragon's Blood actually comes from a tree whose red resin was mostly used as varnish.\n\nStraight out of Harry Potter\n\n\n\nA container marked aconite, once held a topical pain reliever that is poisonous to eat. But in the Potter series, the plant, also called wolfsbane, helps control violence by werewolves during their full moon transformations.\n\n\n\n\"So if you're having werewolf trouble, it will get you through to the next full moon,\" remarked tour guide Jim Williams with a smile. \"But the practical use was for gout and joint pain.\"\n\nDried wild carrot tops were once used as an anti-inflammatory. Stapp carefully opens a sticky drawer that is stuffed with them. \"They look surprisingly the same way as when they were packaged many years ago,\" she said.\n\nWhat's old is new again\n\n\n\nVisitor Christine Zapata from California said she was intrigued by the variety of plants, including cannabis, the marijuana plant.\n\n\"Herbs and plant-based medicine are coming back now, so it was most interesting for me since I work in the cannabis industry.\"\n\nWilliams pointed out a timeworn box that used to contain bottles of Coca-Cola. The original drink was first marketed in the late 1800's, not as a beverage, but as medicine that could cure a number of ailments. The problem was it could also be addictive.\n\n\"On the box it says 'for exhaustion and headache.' That's when coke still had the cocaine in it,\" he noted.\n\nWhile some medicines were discarded after it was known they were toxic, we still rely on others found in the apothecary for today's modern remedies."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Potions of Yore Preserved in Small US Museum", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/apothecary-museum/4654010.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Dragon's blood, mandrake root and devil's snare were used for potions and spells in the Harry Potter series.

That term, ecologically valid, means that the research attempts to mimic real life.\n\nThe study divided the participants into two groups: The first group was allowed to maintain their normal social media habits. The other, the control group, was restricted to 10 minutes per day on each of the three platforms: Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe restrictions were put in place for three weeks and then the participants returned and were tested for outcomes such as fear of missing out (FOMO), anxiety, depression and loneliness.\n\n\u200bResults of study\n\nThe results showed a very clear link between social media use and increased levels of depression and loneliness.\n\n\u201cUsing less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese effects are particularly pronounced for folks who were more depressed when they came into the study.\u201d\n\nShe calls her findings the \u201cgrand irony\u201d of social media.\n\nWhat is it about social media that\u2019s just so depressing?\n\nHunt says that it\u2019s two major things. The first is that social media invites what Hunt calls \u201cdownward social comparison.\u201d When you\u2019re online, it can sometimes seem that \u201ceveryone else is cooler and having more fun and included in more things and you\u2019re left out,\u201d she said. And that\u2019s just generally demoralizing.\n\nThe second factor is a bit more nuanced.\n\n\u201cTime is a zero-sum game,\u201d Hunt told VOA. \u201cEvery minute you spend online is a minute you are not doing your work or not meeting a friend for dinner or having a deep conversation with your roommate.\u201d\n\nAnd these real life activities are the ones that can bolster self-esteem and self worth, Hunt said.\n\nWhat to learn\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway?\n\nPeople are on their devices, and that\u2019s not going to change, she said. But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said. But she expects her results should generalize at least for people through the age of 30.\n\nHunt says she is now beginning a study to gauge the emotional impact of dating apps."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "For Autistic Kids, Robots Can Be Social, Learning Study Buddy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/for-autistic-kids-robots-can-be-social-skills-learning-study-buddy/4652742.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "Robots have been put to work assembling cars in factories, answering questions at conventions and hotel lobbies, moving packages in warehouses, and more.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "A Black Security Guard Was Killed By Police As He Tried To Stop A Shooting", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-chicago-security-guard-shot-by-police_us_5be9a032e4b0caeec2bbcbb3", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "A black security guard was shot dead by a police officer as he held down a suspect in a shooting at the bar where he worked.\n\nJemel Roberson, 26, was working early Sunday at Manny\u2019s Blue Room \u2015 a bar in the predominantly black Chicago suburb of Robbins, Illinois \u2015 when a patron who was part of a drunken group that had been kicked out returned with a gun at 4 a.m. and opened fire, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nBack at the White House on Monday, Trump tweeted that \u201cmuch was accomplished\u201d in his meetings, but voiced a familiar complaint about America\u2019s allies. He said the U.S. pays billions \u201cprotecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.\u201d\n\nHis France trip made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech during ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 in Paris. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, Pool)\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nBENOIT TESSIER via Getty Images Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (L), Moroccan King Mohammed VI (3rd L) and his son Crown Prince Hassan Moulay (2nd L), U.S. First Lady Melania Trump (C), U.S. President Donald Trump (3rd R), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (2nd R) and French President Emmanuel Macron attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on November 11, 2018 as part of commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the 11 November 1918 armistice, ending World War I. (BENOIT TESSIER/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn\u2019t stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "A Black Security Guard Was Killed By Police As He Tried To Stop A Shooting", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-chicago-security-guard-shot-by-police_us_5be9a032e4b0caeec2bbcbb3", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:53", "body_paragraphs": "A black security guard was shot dead by a police officer as he held down a suspect in a shooting at the bar where he worked.\n\nJemel Roberson, 26, was working early Sunday at Manny\u2019s Blue Room \u2015 a bar in the predominantly black Chicago suburb of Robbins, Illinois \u2015 when a patron who was part of a drunken group that had been kicked out returned with a gun at 4 a.m. and opened fire, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "16 Gifts For Fitness Enthusiasts Who'd Rather Be Working Out", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fitness-gifts-for-fitness-lovers-him-her_us_5be8b0d8e4b0e843889944eb", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "DisobeyArt via Getty Images\n\nThey wake up at the crack of dawn, schedule workouts in-between work meetings and book hotels based on their proximity to gyms and studios.

What first drew us together was our love of style. That night I chatted so openly with him because I believed he was gay. He was wearing a purple Lanvin suit with a floral tie, a polka-dotted pocket square and striped socks. I couldn\u2019t believe that a man who dressed so well could actually be straight.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after our third \u201cdate\u201d (he wore a blue window-paned suit and red shoes) that I began to realize that he wasn\u2019t interested in being my stylish gay friend, but my stylish boyfriend.\n\nEverything blossomed. We spent weekends vintage shopping, he flew out to join me when I traveled for work, he would stay over at my place for days on end. But something was amiss. He never wanted me to visit his apartment.\n\nI wondered what he was hiding \u2014 a second family, a love of taxidermy, a mother? It all seemed especially odd as this man with such incredible personal style would surely live in the chicest of pads.\n\nTalking him into inviting me over was a lengthy process. He swerved my requests constantly or offered frustrating platitudes like, \u201cOne day, darling.\u201d I could see that it was a sensitive subject for him and, not wishing to rock the love boat, I allowed this dynamic to continue for an entire year before something inside me snapped.\n\nI had an upcoming day filled with Manhattan-based appointments and I asked him if I could use his apartment between meetings rather than schlepping back to my Brooklyn pad in between. I saw the dodge coming as he began to shift in his chair. I broke, my request turning into an infuriated demand. This time he relented. He stood up from his chair and gathered his coat and bag, claiming he needed to \u201ctidy the place up a little\u201d before I arrived the next day. I wondered if I\u2019d ever see him again, but I had his address, or at least the address he\u2019d given me.\n\nEntering the building, I was greeted by a doorman. This boded well. I rode the elevator to the seventh floor and as I stepped out and moved along the corridor, Richard\u2019s face appeared through the crack of an apartment door.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t judge me,\u201d he quietly pleaded.\n\n\u201cOf course I won\u2019t judge you, how bad can it be?\u201d I responded.\n\nStepping inside, I was met by a scene reminiscent of the TV show \u201cHoarders.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried about me saying anything because words truly failed me. The blinds were drawn and no lights were on, but in the darkness I could make out very little floor space underneath endless piles of\u2026 stuff. He had to guide me through it by the hand. He led me into the small galley kitchen, which resembled a community theatre set of a 1980s kitchen. Faux-wood laminate cabinets hung off the walls at crooked angles and a fridge that had presumably once been white was gray. The \u201cMad Men\u201d-style apartment I\u2019d envisioned had been replaced with the reality that this was the apartment of an actual madman.\n\nNone of it made sense. This was a man who matched his eyeglass frames to his socks. This was a man who agreed that leopard print was a neutral. This was a man who once suggested I\u2019d look good in red, to which I scoffed, tried on the red dress he\u2019d picked out, twirled before the mirror and wore the dress to a party the very next day. This was a man of exquisite tastes. Or was he?\n\nFive minutes in that storage-unit-masquerading-as-an-apartment was all I could manage the first time, but I\u2019m no quitter. I came back the next day and made the first of what would turn out to be a string of demands. This one was simple: Turn the lights on.\n\nWith the full scope of the situation revealed to me by a flickering overhead light, I wasn\u2019t really sure how to react. I was horrified, but so was he. What could I say that he didn\u2019t already know? I was standing in the smoldering ruins of a marriage, a compulsive shopping habit stemming from his diagnosed OCD, and a giant relationship hurdle I wasn\u2019t sure I could clear. We shut the door on the apartment and I didn\u2019t return for a month.\n\nHumans are very adaptable, and it\u2019s true that you can get used to anything given enough time. Little by little, I started to stay over at his chaotic apartment. I couldn\u2019t find anything in the mess so it meant that I was waited on hand and foot by my continually embarrassed boyfriend. The surroundings were insufferable, but it was fun to be brought coffee and sandwiches as I tapped away on my laptop in the middle of the bed, the only area that was clear.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Ruthie Darling\n\nIf outwardly I was understanding, inside I was plotting. I just needed a window of opportunity to enact my dastardly plan, and that moment arrived one weekend when Richard announced he\u2019d be heading out of town for the day to visit his family. I knew what this meant for me: hours alone in this nightmarish place and access to cleaning products. What I was planning was risky, but someone needed to break the hex on this apartment. I didn\u2019t have a sage stick, but I did have Fantastik.\n\nAs he left the apartment he eyed me suspiciously. \u201cThere\u2019s coffee in the pot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGreat. Should I ever find it, I\u2019ll drink it,\u201d I replied with a wink.\n\nHe sighed and moved toward the elevator wearing an eggplant-colored vest over a Pucci shirt with burnt-orange pants, an ensemble only he could pull off so nonchalantly. As the apartment door clicked shut, I spun around like a Bond villainess. I think I was actually rubbing my hands together.\n\nIt took me 45 minutes to locate the vacuum cleaner, but once I found it I was cleaning those floors like a drugged-up 1950s housewife. I put clothes in the closets, I put books on shelves and wiped years of dust off of old photo frames. Anything clearly garbage was bagged up and slowly but surely, parquet floor tiles began to emerge before me.\n\nI wish I could say that my cleaning spell resembled one of those montage scenes in the movies, the kind where we see a whirlwind of activity underscored by Survivor\u2019s \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and that ends in a sparkling apartment. Alas, this would take more than one afternoon, plus I\u2019d run out of Windex.\n\nLater that evening, when I heard the key in the lock, I braced myself. I had no idea what his reaction would be. I hoped he\u2019d fall to his knees in gratitude, but I\u2019m a realist and change is hard.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d was his first question, his face full of anxiety. \u201cI had a system! How will I find anything now?\u201d\n\nI almost laughed, but thought better of it. An evening of sulking and heavy sighing on his part ensued, and I figured I had gone too far. I left for my own apartment that night and realized that my actions were perhaps invasive and cruel. I sent an apology text that went unanswered. Concerned for the state of our relationship, I returned to his apartment the next day with a rehearsed apology speech, only to run into him in the lobby pulling a handcart piled high with boxes. He smiled at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking all of these to Housing Works,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since my \u201ccleaning spell\u201d and progress has been made. Not only can we now walk about without falling over things, but some treasures have been unearthed.\n\nOne thing I will say in praise of never throwing anything away is that his apartment is truly a museum of his life, even if mostly the life he had before we met. I\u2019ve spent evenings with him reading through sweet love letters from 30 years ago, leafing through his art school projects and holding old slides up to the (now clean) windows. We even found an article a former girlfriend had written about him in Cosmopolitan in 1981 titled \u201cThe Terribly Tidy Man.\u201d The irony was not lost on us, and I\u2019m considering contacting her to collaborate on a before and after book.\n\nI know more about Richard through sifting the contents of his apartment than I ever could have hoped to by simply hearing him reminisce. Though photos of his ex-wife now reside in drawers, I would never have him throw them out. He loved her once, and who am I to discard love? All the experiences he\u2019s had in his life have formed him into the sweet, nutty man I love now. I don\u2019t wish to destroy this museum, only curate it. Some things on display, others in the archives.\n\nThe place also needs to be repainted. This will be difficult for him, I predict, but we\u2019ll do it together, not when he\u2019s out of town."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "See The Stirring Anti-Palm Oil Ad Deemed Too Political For TV", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/palm-oil-ad-too-political-for-tv_us_5be830dbe4b0e8438898e8d0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:55", "body_paragraphs": "A stirring television ad that highlights palm oil\u2019s massive wildlife destruction has been barred from TV broadcast in the U.K. after it was deemed too political.\n\nThe animated film shows an orangutan making a child\u2019s bedroom its home after its mother and rainforest habitat were destroyed by growers of palm oil, a vegetable oil that\u2019s found in roughly half of all packaged products sold in supermarkets.\n\nSuch destruction has contributed to orangutans being classified as critically endangered.\n\nBritish grocery store Iceland released the video titled \u201cRang-tan\u201d last week as its Christmas advertisement.

Sometimes I get trigger point injections \u2015 shots of lidocaine into my muscles to stop them from spasming, a frequent occurrence due to my degenerative collagen disorder. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also causes my joints to frequently dislocate, randomly and without warning, causing severe and constant pain.\n\nBut the main reason I make this 40-minute drive every month is to pick up a paper prescription for my pain meds; they\u2019re considered a controlled substance, so the law forbids me from refilling them digitally. And every time I make the trip, I\u2019m reminded that even the medical world isn\u2019t designed for sick people like me.\n\nIt starts when I pull into the parking lot and decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, even though I\u2019d obviously rather use it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether my hips are dislocated that day or not; I never use my wheelchair here.\n\nThe building has an elevator I can take to the second-floor office, but it shudders and judders the whole way up, so I use the stairs. I\u2019m then met with two heavy glass doors, and if I were sitting in my chair, the handles would be too high to reach, the doors too heavy to hold. The fact there isn\u2019t an automatic door opener here has always struck me as strange.\n\nIn the waiting room, there\u2019s no space to park myself when seated in my wheelchair; I\u2019d end up inevitably being tripped on. Plus, the doorway between the waiting room and exam rooms is so narrow that wheeling through would be an impossibility (and no automatic door openers here, either). The exam tables aren\u2019t equipped to motor down to my level, which means I\u2019d have to stand up out of my chair to clamber onto the table. The entire experience would be an effort in exhaustion and inaccessibility, so I tough it out on foot instead.\n\nIn many ways, I\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine. As a partially ambulatory disabled patient with a host of chronic health conditions, I regularly run into what feels like a never-ending gamut of issues every time I visit one of my practitioners. And I\u2019m far from the exception to the rule.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine.\n\nInaccessibility issues often start long before disabled patients make it to their appointments. I can drive myself most days or schedule my appointments when my fianc\u00e9 can drive me \u2015 and good thing, because I am never asked or given recommendations about transportation (except to be told I can\u2019t drive myself home post-anesthesia). Patients with disabilities who aren\u2019t partially ambulatory like I am often have to figure out the logistics on their own, which means complicated mass transit systems or paying out of pocket for paratransit rides. Paratransit riders often have to book 24 hours in advance, usually by telephone, and most agencies make riders pay with cash or a paper voucher. If a patient is d/Deaf, they might need a teleprinter/teletypewriter \u2015 a specialized text telephone that doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2015 to schedule the ride. Requiring cash payment means disabled people now have to take the additional step of making a separate trip to the bank in order to be able to pay.\n\nAnd before you suggest them, ridesharing options like Lyft or Uber are a far cry from a solution. They\u2019re often either inaccessible or rife with discrimination. Uber was sued in 2018 for its fleet\u2019s lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Another 2018 study found that Lyft provided a wheelchair-accessible vehicle in only three of 65 attempts to request one \u2015 a disturbing 95 percent failure rate. Uber managed only 27 out of 49 attempts for a WAV. In all, researchers located a WAV in just 26 percent of attempts (compared with a 100 percent success rate for non-accessible vehicles).\n\nMedical offices themselves are an issue, too, as is the equipment inside them. Disabled patients often have difficulty using X-ray machines, rehab equipment, scales, scanning devices like MRIs and even just getting up on exam tables. Federal civil rights laws require medical offices to be accessible, but few are \u2014 and the ones that exist are hard to find. A 2012 study of 2,389 primary care facilities in California found that a mere 8 percent were equipped with a height-adjustable exam table, and less than 4 percent had an accessible weight scale. A 2013 telephone survey of 256 specialty offices across four U.S. cities for a fictional wheelchair-using patient found that 22 percent of practices reported they couldn\u2019t accommodate the patient. Amazingly, the clinicians who refused to accommodate the fictional patient also failed to recognize that their refusal was illegal under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us.\n\nThose very same ADA laws also mandate that hospitals receiving federal funding provide deaf patients with help to ensure effective communication. However, while I frequently see hospital signs declaring patients have easy access to other language interpreters, I\u2019ve never seen one mentioning the availability of an American Sign Language interpreter. And, as a patient, I\u2019m never asked about any hearing issues, even though I\u2019m hard of hearing as a result of jaw surgery in 2013 (and far too many rock concerts without earplugs). I\u2019m rarely offered alternatives to spoken communication, like written pamphlets, and I am never asked about learning disabilities like dyscalculia, dyslexia or auditory processing disorders.\n\nDoctors carry their own deeply ingrained assumptions about disability, and non-disabled doctors simply lack the understanding of what living with a disability actually entails. Research has shown that, as a result, disabled patients receive inferior health care, including less information about prevention and fewer screening tests, such as Pap tests and mammograms. A 2006 study showed disabled women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely than non-disabled women to undergo breast-conserving surgery. Those who did were still less likely to receive standard radiation therapy. Unsurprisingly, disabled people diagnosed with such cancers were significantly more likely to die as a result.\n\nPatients with intellectual disabilities (whether the diagnosis is accurate or not) are significantly more vulnerable in medical settings than the general population, and their decreased life expectancy reflects that reality. Studies show that less than 20 percent of medical schools teach their students how to talk with intellectually disabled patients about their needs. Delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment are the No. 1 reason why individuals with intellectual disabilities die at least a decade earlier than non-disabled patients on average.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability. And as with so many issues involving disabled people, we have to start at the beginning to enact fixes. Disabled people need to be involved from the ground up. This means medical schools need to offer clear instruction that teaches future doctors how to interact with and examine disabled patients, but it also means that medical schools need to be more accessible when including and training disabled students to become future doctors. More disabled doctors mean a more widespread need and appreciation for accessibility \u2015 for patients and for those giving care, too.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability.\n\nAs usual, this means our world as a whole needs to place a much higher focus on making the world more accessible. I\u2019ve written before about how music venues and airline travel are widely inaccessible to wheelchair users, and medicine is no different. Our society hasn\u2019t yet insisted upon accessibility as a bare minimum, and disabled humans suffer as a result. It\u2019s an ouroboros of epic proportions: Disabled people are forcibly excluded, which is why non-disabled people don\u2019t think to include us. It often starts in preschool or elementary school, when the buildings are inaccessible, and continues through high school and extends into higher ed. When we can\u2019t pursue higher levels of education, we are excluded from job opportunities. Exclusion from job opportunities means we aren\u2019t the ones in medical school, insisting upon education about how to properly treat us \u2014 and we aren\u2019t the architects helping design accessible hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices, either.\n\nDisabled people make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, but 20 percent isn\u2019t enough to enact change, no matter how loud we\u2019re yelling. We need non-disabled people to join the rallying cry. If you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us. Old age will alter your mobility, your functionality, your ability to move and your autonomy. At some point, the heavy glass doors at your doctor\u2019s office will stymy you, too. Wouldn\u2019t you rather the world be an accessible place before that happens?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Gab, Social Network Favored By The Far Right, Goes Back Online", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gab-back-online_us_5be01052e4b09d43e32099a9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:56", "body_paragraphs": "Gab, a social network popular among alt-right activists and white nationalists, went back online Sunday after having gone dark following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people.\n\nThe platform, a self-labeled champion of free speech, was dropped by domain provider GoDaddy.com last week.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:56", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013. (Rubin disputes the claim.)\n\nGetty Editorial Google employees at its European headquarters in Dublin join others around the world in walking out of their offices on Nov. 1 in protest over claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism at the tech giant.\n\nThe company gave three executives similarly cushy treatment, even though it did not have any legal obligation to do so, the Times found.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above for sexual harassment,\u201d Pichai noted in his email. \u201cNone of these people received an exit package. And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.\u201d\n\nEvent organizers published a list of five demands for protesters to coalesce around, including pay equity, greater transparency at several levels in Google and an end to forced arbitration agreements.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nProtesters at the walkout in New York City hoisted signs calling out sexual misconduct and gender inequity in tech, with at least a couple of pointed references to Rubin\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cHappy to quit for $90 million,\u201d read one woman\u2019s sign. \u201cNo sexual harassment required!\u201d\n\nThe first of many coordinated #GoogleWalkout protests has begun - this is at the firm\u2019s office in Singapore.

He traveled frequently to Washington, where Saudi-paid lobbyists brought him to think tanks to give optimistic assessments about the campaign\u2019s progress and he extolled the Saudi concern for the welfare of civilians.\n\nBy 2017, however, the Saudi campaign that General Assiri oversaw in Yemen had ground into a military stalemate and, despite his assurances, a humanitarian catastrophe. But his patron, Prince Mohammed, also consolidated his power over all of the kingdom\u2019s security apparatuses, and he promoted General Assiri to the deputy head of the kingdom\u2019s spy agency, the General Intelligence Directorate.\n\nWestern analysts believe that Prince Mohammed moved General Assiri there in part to keep an eye on the spy chief, Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan, known as Abu Ali, who was close to Western intelligence agencies and suspected of harboring loyalties to one of the crown prince\u2019s royal rivals.\n\nGeneral Assiri was dismissed last month when the Saudi government acknowledged Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing and said he had organized the operation. On Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said his government had handed over a recording of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Britain and France, pressuring President Trump to more harshly punish the Saudis over the murder."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "Trump\u2019s Nationalism, Rebuked at World War I Ceremony, Is Reshaping Much of Europe", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/us/politics/macron-trump-paris-wwi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 19:01:59", "body_paragraphs": "Aside from the discord with the French president, Mr. Trump\u2019s two-day visit to Paris was marred by his decision on Saturday to scrap a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at the foot of the hill where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought.

I objected, but he insisted that the caffeine doesn\u2019t affect him, meaning it doesn\u2019t disturb his sleep.\n\nBut when I noticed how easily he became upset or angered by minor irritations many times a day, I decided to look into what is known about the bodily effects of so much caffeine and whether it might contribute to the harmful effects of stress on the heart.\n\nCaffeine is by far America\u2019s leading nonprescription drug, regularly consumed by some 90 million adults each day in coffee, tea, soft and energy drinks and some prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n\nAmounts can range widely. An 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee may contain 95 to 165 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of instant coffee delivers 63 milligrams. One ounce of espresso has 47 to 64 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed black tea, 25 to 48 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed green tea, 25 to 29 milligrams; 8 ounces of cola, 24 to 46 milligrams, whereas a 12-ounce energy drink can contain as much as 300 milligrams. Much smaller amounts of caffeine can be found in chocolate, decaffeinated coffee, some candies and even some foods like waffles."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "F.D.A.

None of the major tobacco companies would comment on the possibility of barring menthol cigarettes at this early stage.\n\nBut such a move has been long-awaited by public health advocates, who have been especially concerned about the high percentage of African-Americans who become addicted to menthol cigarettes.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency\u2019s commissioner, would not comment publicly on the proposal on Friday.

Its device resembles a flash drive, and has had a stunning appeal among youths ever since it was introduced.\n\nDr. Gottlieb focused on Juul and several other major e-cigarette makers in September, warning them to stop marketing to teenagers or risk being banned. He set a 60-day deadline for the major companies to prove they could keep their devices away from minors, and that timetable ends this weekend.\n\nAt the same time, the F.D.A. also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling the devices to minors, and issues fines to some of them.\n\nThe latest actions follow months of meetings between the F.D.A. and e-cigarette makers over how to prevent teenagers from getting hooked on their products.\n\nJuul, which has more than 70 percent of the nation\u2019s e-cigarette market and has become ubiquitous in many high schools and middle schools, submitted thousands of pages of marketing documents and related materials. But the regulators, not satisfied, then visited the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters in September and seized more.\n\nThe four other products facing the 60-day deadline were RJR Vapor Co.\u2019s Vuse, Imperial Brands\u2019 blu and devices made by Logic. None of the companies responded to immediate requests for comment.\n\nRJR, Imperial and Altria are all major tobacco companies, which along with other industry heavyweights have viewed e-cigarettes as critical to their survival now that smoking rates have declined to their lowest levels in the United States."}]
