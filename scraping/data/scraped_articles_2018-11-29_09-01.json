It is the latest sign of an increasingly aggressive effort to define the end game of the investigation with what looks more and more like an effort to use his presidential power to protect himself.\n\nTrump's latest maneuvering came amid indications that Mueller's team, after a hiatus in midterm election season, is accelerating toward a pivotal moment in an investigation that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency.\n\nAs always with the President, it is difficult to decipher whether his comments represent a clear intent to act or are a case of a volatile personality blowing off steam in a way that does not meet accepted standards for someone who could be in legal jeopardy.\n\nBut Trump appears to be making a significant gamble. His pardon comments could be interpreted as another bid to thwart Mueller's investigation into election interference in plain sight -- even as he is himself a subject of the s pecial counsel's obstruction of justice inquiries.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin on Trump comment: Egregiously inappropriate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin on Trump comment: Egregiously inappropriate 01:10\n\nTrump significantly dialed up hostilities with Mueller after several days of significant developments in the investigation and amid signs his nerves are increasingly frayed over what might happen next.\n\nAmong those developments is the revelation that Trump told Mueller, in his written answers to questions from the special counsel, that former political aide Roger Stone did not talk to him about WikiLeaks. Trump also wrote that he was not told about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting of his son and campaign officials with a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAsked in the Post interview a bout the possibility of a pardon for Manafort, who led his campaign at a key stage in 2016, Trump said that \"it was never discussed, but I wouldn't take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?\"\n\nTrump also issued a chilling warning to Democrats who will take control of the House in January that he could use his unique powers as President to target them by declassifying intelligence that would be damaging to them.\n\n\"If they want to play tough, I will do it,\" Trump told the Post, referring to documents related to the early stages of the Russia probe.\n\n\"They will see how devastating those pages are.\"\n\nIn a sign of what's on the President's mind throughout the day, he started and ended Wednesday with tweets about Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!\" Trump tweeted at 11:39 p.m. Wednesday -- exactly 15 hours after he first tweeted about the special counsel probe.\n\nWhat is behind Trump's timing?\n\nThe timing of Trump's escalation is intriguing.\n\nIt came a day after Manafort's cooperation agreement with Mueller collapsed as he was accused of lying on multiple occasions by the special counsel. That news also brought the revelation that Manafort's defense team had been sharing details about the investigation with Trump's lawyers.\n\nIn a volley of provocative tweets and attacks, Trump is also accusing Mueller of trying to force three key players -- who appear to be Manafort, Stone and his associate Jerome Corsi -- to lie or go to jail.\n\nCorsi this week claimed to have turned down a plea bargain deal with Mueller. He and Stone are being investigated for alleged ties to WikiLeaks, which published hacked Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian spies and is seen by US intelligence as a front for a hostile foreign state.\n\nTrump's comments about all three men came across as a resounding message to hang tough and to defy Mueller's investigators and any pressure to cooperate.\n\nThey are certain to raise the stakes in his confrontation with the special counsel and are likely to unleash a significant political reaction from Democrats about to take over the House, lighting a fire under congressional oversight of Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, exemplifying the potential political consequences of Trump's subsequent comments, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee delivered a warning to the President.\n\n\"I suspect they're dangling a pardon in front of Manafort,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, told CNN's Erin Burnett.\n\n\"But the President should understand that even dangling a pardon in front of a witness like Manafort is dangerously close to obstruction of justice and would just fortify a claim or a charge of obstruction of justice against the President.\"\n\nIt could be argued that Trump's comments amount only to notice that he reserves the right to wield the pardon power granted to every President under the Constitution.\n\nTo make a case that Trump had obstructed justice, Mueller would have to show that the President had acted with corrupt intent.\n\nIf he does go in that direction, it's possible that Wednesday's remarks by Trump could take their place in a body of similar evidence, including his apparent request for then-FBI Director James Comey to offer a break to his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his on-camera explanation that he later fired Comey over the Russia probe, which Comey was then overseeing.\n\n\"The complication of the past 24 hours with the Manafort plea agreement having imploded almost sets the table with a circumstantial case of obstruction,\" Harry Litman, a former deputy assistant attorney general, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin.\n\n\"Any pardon now would look like a reward to Manafort for an extraordinary kind of double-cross of the prosecutor here both promising to be truthful and not being so, then funneling information to Trump -- which I cannot tell you how extraordinary it is.\"\n\nReading Manafort's mind\n\nManafort's motivations in allegedly lying to Mueller are also crucial.\n\nSusan Hennessey, a CNN analyst who's a former senior attorney at the National Security Agency, said there were only two possibilities.\n\n\"Either he is incredibly stupid and pathological in lying to investigators after striking a plea deal or this is some kind of bid for pardon,\" Hennessey said on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\"\n\nWhatever the motivations of Manafort and the President, one thing is clear: Trump is becoming consumed by the prospect of Mueller's conclusions, tweeting out wild attacks in the morning and returning to to his preoccupation as the day wears on in a flurry of interviews.\n\nIn one sign of the President's agitation, he took a page out of a propagandist's playbook, retweeting a montage showing former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and other top former officials behind bars.\n\n\"When do the trials for treason begin?\" read a slogan on the graphic.\n\nHe told the Post that he knew Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was in the image, commenting: \"He should have never picked a special counsel.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Trump railed against plea bargain deals.\n\n\"If you told the truth, you go to jail,\" he told the Post in what effectively amounted to an attack by the country's chief law enforcement officer on a legally mandated investigation.\n\n\"You know this flipping stuff is terrible,\" Trump said. \"You flip and you lie and you get -- the prosecutors will tell you 99% of the time they can get people to flip. It's rare that they can't.\"\n\nThe President's latest attempts to discredit Mueller, part of a strategy apparently designed to shape the political battlefield ahead of the special counsel's eventual conclusions, came only weeks after Trump installed a skeptic of the Mueller investigation, Matt Whitaker, as acting attorney general.\n\nThe move potentially opened a clear channel into the inner workings of the inquiry for the President, and that might in itself account for his increased anxiety over the probe.\n\nThere are clear signs that Mueller's team is intensifying its activity.\n\nHis prosecutors are poring over the written answers to their questions that Trump submitted through his lawyers. They have also pledged to file a court submission detailing Manafort's \"crimes and lies\" that could offer never-before-seen details of the investigation.\n\nIn addition to their interest in Corsi and Stone, Mueller's prosecutors met with Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen this month.\n\nThere is mounting speculation that a new round of indictments could be imminent that could cut ever closer to Trump's inner circle."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump threatens to declassify 'devastating' documents", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/_RP77VDLyMU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said that if Democrats \"want to play tough\" when they control the House of Representatives next year, he will declassify documents that will be \"devastating\" to them.\n\n\"If they want to play tough, I will do it,\" Trump told the New York Post in an interview Wednesday . \"They will see how devastating those pages are.\"\n\nDemocrats are poised to launch a series of investigations after winning a majority in the House in November.

MUST WATCH Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\n\nTrump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.\n\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been \"upset for weeks\" about \"the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nDetails emerge\n\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.\n\nIn the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it \"totally false and deliberately libelous\" and Wikileaks was \"willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nThe paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.\n\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.\n\nIn another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.\n\nIf there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.\n\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been no talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.\n\nPotential impact\n\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.\n\n\"What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\" Ben-Veniste said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.\n\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.\n\n\"A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.\n\nIn the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.\n\nExpectations high\n\nThe latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.\n\nMueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSo expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public\n\n\"Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\" said Ben-Veniste.\n\nSuch a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nThe new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.\n\nTrump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear the White House has said there has been no talk of Trump pardoning Manafort."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Climate change is already here, report says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/aend2h4P4N0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Climate change is here and affecting our health, with extreme heat in particular also having effects on productivity, food supply and disease transmission, a new global report finds.\n\nMore people than ever are vulnerable to heat exposure globally, and numbers are rising, according to The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report by an international group of researchers, published Wednesday.\n\nIt comes just days after climate reports from the US government and the United Nations said that greater action on climate change is needed, with the UN report showing that in 2017 , the highest levels of carbon were emitted globally.\n\nOlder people in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean are most vulnerable because of larger aging and urban populations there.\n\nThe latest report estimates that 42% of over-65s in Europe and 43% in the the Eastern Mediterranean are already vulnerable to heat exposure; 38% of this group is vulnerable in Africa and 34% in Asia.\n\nThe report identified present-day changes impacting public health including lower productivity, decreased crop yields and spread of diseases such as dengue and cholera, said researchers from 27 global institutions, including universities and research centers, and the UN who put together the study.\n\nPresent changes in heat waves and labor capacity \"provide an early warning of the compounded and overwhelming impact on public health that is expected if temperatures continue to rise,\" said Hilary Graham, professor of health sciences at the University of York in the UK, who participated in the report.\n\nIn 2017, 157 million vulnerable people were exposed to heat waves globally, and 153 billion hours of labor were lost due to heat exposure.\n\nThe United States has seen more frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves and a rise in vector-borne disease, with cases of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus tripling between 2004 and 2016, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nDr. Nick Watts, executive director of The Lancet Countdown, stressed that this is \"not something that's happening in 2050 but something that we're already seeing today.\"\n\n\"High- and low- income countries are affected negatively,\" said Elizabeth Robinson, professor of environmental economics at the University of Reading, who was involved in the report. This just manifests in different ways, she added.\n\nThe second in a series, with the first released last year , the report analyzes 41 indicators tracking the link between climate change and health in five areas: climate change impacts, resilience for health, mitigation actions, finance and public engagement.\n\nRobinson explained that there \"is a lot of variability year on year,\" but \"the trend appears to be upwards,\" indicating even more heat wave events in the future. Similarly, numbers of vulnerable people \"are going up over time.\"\n\nSome progress but far from enough\n\nThere have been some promising trends, like an increase in renewable energy, with jobs in that sector rising by 5.7% between 2016 and 2017, according to the report. But the investment in renewables \"is not yet anything like what it would need to be if we are to get to the 1.5 degrees\" -- a commitment agreed during the Paris Climate Agreement to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-Industrial Revolution levels, said Paul Ekins, professor of resources and environment policy at University College London, who was involved in the report.\n\nSome positive trends were also identified in the form of coal phaseouts and cleaner, healthier transportation methods. But coal usage needs to be at 20% of 2010 usage levels by 2040 to meet targets, the report states.\n\nwho authored the American chapter of the Lancet report, said it delivers a message of hope, as action is happening, but she pointed out that \"climate change is harming the health of this country now.\" This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment Dr. Renee Salas, doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital,who authored the American chapter of the Lancet report, said it delivers a message of hope, as action is happening, but she pointed out that \"climate change is harming the health of this country now.\"This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment report published by the White House on Friday.\n\nThis year marked a record summer in many parts of the world, with much higher temperatures than most populations are used to. Watts highlighted a recent study suggesting that the 2018 heat waves across Europe were made twice as likely as a result of climate change. \"Assigning attribution for every single event is difficult, but it's clear that these sorts of events are examples of what is likely to come if we don't rapidly respond to climate change,\" he said.\n\nThe research identified that the global population was on average exposed to a temperature increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1986 and 2017. The global surface temperature change for this period was 0.3 degrees Celsius. This shows that \"populations are aging, growing and migrating in to the areas worst affected by climate change,\" Watts explained.\n\nSalas said that \"We must take aggressive action to combat climate change today so that by the end of the century, we'll have saved thousands of lives each year, along with hundreds of billions of dollars in public health cost.\"\n\nSpread of diseases and fatalities\n\nSmall changes in temperature and rainfall will also help the spread of infectious diseases, the report found.\n\nFor example, the capacity of the dengue virus to spread has increased by 7.8% since the 1950s.\n\nThe seasonal capacity for the Aedes mosquito -- the primary species spreading Zika, dengue and chikungunya -- and its ability to spread have lengthened and strengthened, the report says.\n\n2016 had the most dengue transmission on record, according to the report, and the spread is expected to rise in line with greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nKristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington who also was involved in the report, said the geographic spread of the mosquito that can carry dengue, Zika and chikunguya has increased \"dramatically with higher temperatures.\" She added that the researchers don't see the impacts individually but stressed the wide-ranging effects of climate change.\n\nLevels of global cholera bacteria are also worrying. An increasing trend of rising suitability to Vibrio, the bacteria that can cause cholera and some other illnesses, has been observed globally. The United States witnessed a 27% increase in coastline areas that are suitable for Vibrio infections between the 1980s and 2010s.\n\nWe \"can not ignore these challenges we are seeing,\" said Gina McCarthy, director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in report. She cited the California wildfires and the rise in vector-borne diseases.\n\nDeaths from pollution\n\nA \"lack of progress\" in reducing emissions continues to endanger lives and public health care systems, according to the researchers.\n\nEurope was the region with most premature deaths from ambient air pollution in the form of PM 2.5 -- particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter -- in 2015, followed by the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, the report found.\n\nParticulate matter can settle in airways and cause problems like cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions and cancers, leading to premature death, according to the World Health Organization\n\nPaul Ekins, a professor of resources and environment policy at University College London who was involved in the report, stressed that \"any notion we may have that somehow in Europe, we are kind of doing better than other regions should be displaced.\"\n\nReduced productivity\n\nExtreme heat as a result of climate change cost the world 153 billion hours of work last year, the report found.\n\nIn China alone, 21 billion hours of work were lost to extreme heat in 2017, equal to 1.4% of the country's working population. Robinson said that rising temperatures have \"a direct impact on labor.\"\n\nThe majority of labor hours losses occurred in more vulnerable regions such as India, southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and South America.\n\nAfter decades of global improvement in food security, the report shows that crop yields are falling in 30 countries, including Cuba, the UAE and Luxembourg.\n\nIn some countries, the difference between the actual crop yield achieved and the maximum crop yield proves that negative impacts of climate change cancel out technological improvements, according to a 2011 study , published in the Nature international journal of science.\n\nAre we able to cope?\n\nWatts warned that the report shows over half -- 51% -- of 478 global cities surveyed stated that their public health infrastructure will be seriously compromised by climate change, by overwhelming services with new health threats or from extreme weather events directly threatening health services.\n\nThis means \"systemic failure,\" Watts said, like the shutdown of a hospital.\n\nGlobal spending on climate adaptation for health is at 4.8% -- too little to keep in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, the researchers say.\n\nEurope and Southeast Asia are the biggest spenders, with low-income countries' funding too little to meet their needs, according to the report.\n\nThe report has upped the stakes for faster progress, Ekins said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe believes that the findings represent a \"worse outlook, because we weren't moving fast enough for 2 degrees,\" as agreed in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference, \"and we're definitely not moving fast enough for 1.5\" degrees.\n\nWatts noted that the Lancet Countdown report is not able to say in which direction the world is heading, but \"whichever way we go, it ends up shaping the health profile of countries for the next century.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Swastikas in textbooks: German schools' anti-Semitism problem", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/MliDTvw5XYY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Rachel always thought it was best to hide her religion from her high school students.

They took out their frustration by screaming anti-Semitic slurs at her.\n\nLast year, she decided to switch schools for her own safety. She has not told her new students she's Jewish.\n\nIn a country still haunted by the Holocaust, anti-Semitic incidents in the classroom offer clear evidence that deep wounds haven't healed. Some Jewish teachers and students say they are caught between a surge of traditional right-wing anti-Semitism and threats from Muslim immigrants angry at Israel.\n\nUnsure of how to deal with anti-Semitism in the classroom, Jewish teachers very often keep incidents to themselves to avoid tipping off their own religious identity, according to Marina Chernivsky, the head of the Berlin-based organization Kompetenz Zentrum f\u00fcr Pravention und Empowerment (or Competence Center for Prevention and Empowerment), which provides counseling to individual and institutions after anti-Semitic and discriminatory incidents.\n\nShe recently held a workshop to help Jewish teachers deal with anti-Semitism in their classrooms.

She said she took a risk writing the piece, but it raised awareness around anti-Semitism at her school.\n\n\"Fortunately, I have colleagues who are sensitive and a headmaster who has an interest in preventing anti-Semitism,\" says Schwartze. She cautioned that Jewish teachers who don't have similar support need to \"hide their identity.\"\n\nBerlin's Department of Research and Information on Anti-Semitism (RIAS) said serious incidents affecting Jewish students and teachers in Berlin's schools doubled from 15 to 30 in 2017 and the rate is on a similar pace this year. RIAS said most episodes still go unreported. Those that were reported included a 16-year-old girl taunted by classmates who chanted \"gas for the Jews.\" A 14-year-old boy who was bullied, kicked and shot with an air gun because he was Jewish. And a Jewish student at a prominent international prep school who had cigarette smoke blown in his face while his assailants asked how it felt to be sent to the showers.\n\nFlorian M\u00e4tzschker says he will move to Israel to escape anti-Semitism in Germany.\n\nNineteen-year-old Florian M\u00e4tzschker told CNN he faced so many threats at his Berlin high school that he had to use a separate entrance.\n\n\"As a Jew in Germany you feel attacked on all sides,\" he said. \"There's no trusting the German government to protect us.\"\n\nCareer diplomat Felix Klein, 50, was appointed in April to a newly created cabinet-level position: Germany's anti-Semitism commissioner. He said although anti-Semitic attitudes have long bubbled below the surface in Germany, those views are now exploding into the open.\n\n\"The word Jew as an insult was not common when I went to school,\" said Klein. \"Now it is, and it's even an insult at schools where there are no Jewish students. That's a problem.\"\n\nForgetting the Holocaust\n\nGerman high school students learn about the Holocaust in the ninth grade, around the age of 14 or 15. They're taught about the state-sponsored murder of millions of Jews and they take field trips to nearby concentration camps. A generation ago, teachers lingered on the events of the Third Reich, making sure to present it to students as part of their country's heritage. Now, as survivors dwindle and the immigrant population grows, Jewish leaders fear that history is being cleaved from the German experience.\n\n\"There's been an ever-growing tendency on the part of some in German education to universalize the lessons of the Holocaust,\" said Deidre Berger, the head of the American Jewish Committee in Berlin. \"This was a singular historical event that emanated from Germany, and when German students learn that they need to know that.\"\n\nAnd yet a CNN poll found that 40% of young German adults know little to nothing about the Holocaust. The numbers don't surprise Saraya Gomis, the anti-discrimination commissioner for Berlin's education, youth and family department.\n\n\"So often in schools, the Holocaust is only treated as something in the past and this has nothing to do with our present,\" said Gomis, who is half-German, half-Senegalese. \"It's not enough to just go to concentration camps and say that was a long time ago and now we are good. The result is that students don't see Jews as living people, just something that happened in the past.\"\n\nGuillermo Pineiro, who teaches Spanish and German at a high school in Essen, said the history of the Third Reich is taught at school, but for students \"it's a little more abstract.\"\n\nLast year, after an incident where a group of students were caught using Jewish slurs in class, Pineiro decided to reach out to an organization called \"Rent-a-Jew,\" which finds Jewish volunteers who want to speak about their history and culture.\n\n\"It was the first time any of them had ever met someone Jewish,\" Pineiro said.\n\nTeachers not equipped\n\nThe German government is taking steps to address anti-Semitism in schools. It has dispatched 170 anti-bullying experts to selected schools across the country. Klein said his office is creating a nationwide registry where teachers, administrators, and the general public, can report anti-Semitic incidents. Right now, no such system exists, making it difficult for authorities to understand the scope of the problem.\n\nCNN spoke with dozens of people, including Jewish teachers, students, and parents as well as German government officials and activists. They described a tendency among school administrators to cover up incidents and downplay anti-Semitic bullying. Anti-discrimination commissioner Gomis said many teachers and administrators are ill-equipped to recognize the problem and are more likely to make things worse.\n\n\"Many teachers and principals have a huge lack of knowledge when it comes to dealing with anti-Semitism,\" Gomis said. \"They're not quite sure how to detect it, and when they do, they're too busy or stressed to deal with it.\"\n\nAlthough 76% of Germany's Jews believe anti-Semitism is a problem, 77% of non-Jews in Germany believe the opposite, according to a recent government report. And parents say that makes it hard for administrators to confront anti-Semitism in their own schools.\n\n\"If you ask somebody's who's not Jewish if there are problems with anti-Semitism in Germany, they would say no way,\" said Wenzel Michalski, the father of a 15-year-old who was forced to switch schools after months of anti-Semitic bullying. \"They think it's a Jew making a fuss.\"\n\nMichalski is the head of the German chapter of Human Rights Watch. He said his son began attending Friedenauer Gemeinschaftsschule in December 2016. Its motto: \"A School Without Racism\".\n\nThe grandson of a Holocaust survivor, Michalski's son told his new classmates he was Jewish.\n\n\"He said it was like you could a hear a pin drop,\" said Michalski. \"His cover was blown. His new friends said you can't hang out with us anymore because you're Jewish and the attacks quickly became worse and worse.\"\n\nMichalski says his son, who was 14 at the time, was smacked on the head and kicked to the point where he developed bruises. Three months into his stint at the school, a fellow student shot him with an air gun while taunting him with anti-Semitic slurs.\n\nMichalski said school administrators tried to play it off as \"boys will be boys,\" and were unwilling to do anything about the incident. He ended up pulling his son out of the school three months after he enrolled.\n\nCNN has contacted the school for comment and did not receive a response. In an interview with the German publication Der Tagesspiegel, principal Uwe Runkel defended the school's actions and said that administrators reacted quickly when they learned what had happened.\n\nRunkel later posted a message on the school's website detailing the steps he took to address anti-Semitism, which included reporting the incident to Gomis' office and hosting group discussions, mediated by trained experts, where students and teachers could discuss how the school should deal with anti-Semitic bullying in the future.\n\nA year and a half later, Michalski says the school still hasn't taken the issue seriously enough.\n\n\"When you see how they react, it's not surprising that there's a new generation of kids growing up as anti-Semites,\" Michalski said.\n\nReady to leave?\n\nFive years ago, Germany's Jews would have never considered moving away from the country, according to Doron Rubin, the leader of Berlin's Kahal Adass Jisroel community organization. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Germany was in the midst of a Jewish revival -- the population had grown to over 200,000, and rabbis were ordained in Berlin for the first time since the Holocaust.\n\nNow, Rubin said, the question of leaving is being discussed again.\n\n\"I think the German establishment is surprised to be dealing with anti-Semitism again,\" said Rubin. \"They thought it was something that's past, and I think in recent years they've understood it's a broader problem that's not just going to go away.\"\n\nCommunity leaders in part blame an increase in inflammatory rhetoric from far-right parties like Alternative for Germany (AfD) for changing public discourse. They say it is not only Jews who are targeted by racist rhetoric -- Muslim, African and LGBT communities are also affected.\n\n\"Right-wing populism plays a huge role in making people feel comfortable using slurs,\" says Alexander Rasumny executive director of RIAS. \"I think we're seeing a shift in the thing that can be said in public, and opinions that are socially accepted.\"\n\nA man raises his arm in a Heil Hitler salute towards heckling leftists at a right-wing protest in Chemnitz.\n\nThe neo-Nazi banners and salutes that have appeared at recent far-right protests have alarmed German Jews, but many say the more immediate threat is from parts of Germany's immigrant population. They say they are often targeted with slurs by Muslims. According to Klein, traditional tools for tackling neo-Nazism are not a solution and he is looking to leaders in the Muslim community for help.\n\n\"When we talk about Muslim-originated anti-Semitism, I think we can only win that battle with the help of the moderate Muslims,\" Klein said. \"Without them, this won't be a successful fight.\"\n\nSome of that work is already underway. Named after a heavily Muslim neighborhood in Berlin, the Kreuzberg Initiative against anti-Semitism (KIgA) sends teaching guides into more than 40 schools across Germany to help counsel young Muslims at risk of radicalization. One of the goals: encourage dialogue among Muslim students and their Jewish peers.\n\nKIgA's chairman Dervis Hizarci cautions against painting all Muslims as anti-Semitic. Doing so, he said, further alienates young Muslims who may also be facing discrimination in German society.\n\n\"We have to make Muslims feel addressed,\" Hizarci said. \"Fighting anti-Semitism among Muslims can only succeed if we do that together with Muslims. If we talk to Muslims instead of talking about them.\"\n\nPeaceful dialogue might be a difficult proposition, especially when many young Jews are determined to defend Israel's policies. Before graduating last year, Florian M\u00e4tzschker said he was one of two Jews at a 1,200-student high school in Berlin's Wedding district. M\u00e4tzschker didn't come from a religious family, but the more he was threatened, the more he began dreaming of moving to Israel to join the Israeli army.\n\nLast December, he was sitting alone in the school cafeteria when a group of Muslim classmates came up to him and started giving him a hard time about US President Donald Trump moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He tried to defend Israel's claim to the city.\n\n\"That's when they started saying over and over again, 'We will destroy you', and then one girl said to me 'Adolf Hitler was a good guy because he killed the Jews,'\" M\u00e4tzschker said. \"She just kept saying it over and over again. I was in shock.\"\n\nHe said the comment set him off. He told her she wasn't allowed to say that. That's when the group of students started swarming him, screaming \"Israel is the murderer.\"\n\n\"I was really, really scared,\" M\u00e4tzschker said. \"I couldn't get out, they had me surrounded on all sides. It was like suffocating. I finally broke away, but even the teachers were scared to step in.\"\n\nFor the rest of the year he spent breaks sequestered from his fellow students and covered his yarmulke under a baseball cap.\n\n\"I got through because I kept saying to myself, 'One day soon, I will be in Israel and this will all be over.'\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Lion Air pilots fought automatic safety system before plane crashed into sea", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/edOqaSQXCZM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 were engaged in a futile tug-of-war with the plane's automatic systems in the minutes before it plunged into the ocean, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nBut investigators say they are at a loss to explain why the pilots didn't follow the same procedure performed by another flight crew the previous day when they encountered a similar issue.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash released Wednesday by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) reveals more details about the final moments of Flight 610, but acknowledges many questions remain.\n\nData retrieved from the flight recorder shows the pilots repeatedly fought to override an automatic safety system installed in the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane, which pulled the plane's nose down more than two dozen times.\n\nThe system was responding to faulty data, which suggested that the nose was tilted at a higher angle than it was, indicating the plane was at risk of stalling.\n\nAccording to the report, the pilots first manually corrected an \"automatic aircraft nose down\" two minutes after takeoff and performed the same procedure again and again before the plane hurtled nose-first into the Java Sea.\n\nCNN aviation analyst David Soucie said that the circumstances created by the plane's automatic correction would have made pilot intervention \"impossible.\"\n\n\"The fact that they fought against the MCAS (multiple) times with the trim settings was an impossible scenario to recover from,\" he said.\n\nJUST WATCHED What we know about the Lion Air plane crash Replay More Videos ...

What was the problem that may heard on the CVR. So why the action difference, this is the thing we need to find. At the moment I don't have the answer,\" said the NTSC's head of aviation, Capt. Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\nIssue reported two minutes into flight\n\nThe preliminary report said Flight 610 reported a issues minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital on October 29 en route to the city of Pangkal Pinang, on the island of Bangka.\n\nWithin 90 seconds of takeoff, the co-pilot asked air traffic control to confirm air speed and altitude. Thirty seconds after that he reported that they had experienced a \"flight control problem,\" the report said.\n\nAfter the aircraft's flaps retracted following takeoff, the automatic trim problem noted on the previous night's flight returned, until the flight data recorder stopped recording when the plane crashed.\n\nThe report said the pilots on the plane's penultimate flight reported that instruments were showing inaccurate readouts from the angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors.\n\nThe report said that the plane was \"automatically trimming\" on the previous flight -- that is, the computer was adjusting the aircraft's angle -- so the pilots switched to manual trim and, as their safety checklists didn't recommend an emergency landing, they continued to Jakarta.\n\nFurther maintenance on the AoA sensor was carried out in Jakarta prior to Flight 610's takeoff the next morning. After the flight took off, the instruments recorded a substantial discrepancy in the aircraft's angle -- as much as 20 degrees.\n\nAviation expert Geoffrey Thomas called the report \"very comprehensive\" and said that he could not understand why Lion Air had deemed the plane suitable for service.\n\n\"Clearly the plane had serious sensor issues ... why the airplane wasn't pulled out of service beggars belief,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Tinkering around and replacing parts isn't enough.\"\n\nAs part of the continued investigation, the faulty AoA sensor will undergo further testing, the NTSC said. It plans to finish its report within 12 months.\n\nCaptain's mother: Son said sim training unnecessary\n\nThe pilot's mother Sangeeta Suneja, herself a senior commercial manager with Air India, told CNN after a family briefing Tuesday that her son was \"a sunny boy. He was loved by everybody in his company.\"\n\nShe says her son, Capt. Bhavye Suneja told her there was no updated training simulation session when Lion Air started using the new aircraft.\n\n\"They said it was not required... When the transition happened, he said, 'Mama, I'm going to fly the MAX.' I said, 'How can you do that (when) you don't have (a) simulator session?' He said, 'We don't need to.'\"\n\nComing from an aviation family, she said that Suneja's sister wanted to follow in his footsteps, but that the fatal accident had shaken her faith in the technology.\n\n\"Even my daughter wants to be a pilot. She was so inspired by him she also wants to be a pilot,\" she said.\n\n\"Now I have apprehensions. I don't know. How safe it is. The trust in the machine is shaky now.\"\n\nShe added that air safety regulation across the world needed to be re-established to reaffirm people's trust in air travel.\n\n\"Whenever they (present new aircraft) to the market, where the life of the people is at stake, the regulators must re-establish three, or five, levels of crosscheck...

The Bank of England followed later in the day with its own assessment.\n\nThe United Kingdom would be worse off under all scenarios studied by the government. Officials did not estimate the precise impact of the deal Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the European Union , but even in the best case it too will mean a weaker economy than remaining in the bloc.\n\n\"It is true that the economy will be very slightly smaller, but if we do the deal in the way that the prime minister has set out and negotiated, that impact will be entirely manageable,\" UK Treasury chief Philip Hammond told the BBC.\n\nThe official estimates underscore the harsh economic reality of Brexit: Under any scenario, leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer than staying in.\n\n\"If you look purely at the economics, remaining in the single market would give us an economic advantage,\" Hammond said.\n\nThe Bank of England said that May's plan could result in new trade barriers that would cause the UK economy to be 0.75% smaller than currently forecast in 2023. If she can negotiate a future trade relationship with the European Union that does not include customs checks or regulatory barriers, the economy could be 1.75% larger.\n\nThere are just four months to go until Brexit, and it's still not clear whether May can deliver an orderly departure from the bloc.\n\nThe legally-binding divorce deal she has negotiated would give business much-needed certainty about the next two years.\n\nBut she still needs to secure approval from a skeptical parliament, and a much looser agreement on the trading relationship after the transition period provides very few details.\n\nAnalysis commissioned by a group campaigning for a second referendum showed the UK economy would be 4% smaller by 2030 under May's deal than it would otherwise have been. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said on Monday that new trade barriers would make it difficult to sell services from the United Kingdom and discourage investment.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May is trying to sell her Brexit plan to a skeptical parliament.\n\nIf May's plan fails, potential alternatives include crashing out of the European Union without a deal, a second referendum or a general election in Britain.\n\n\"The important thing ... is to keep trade flowing as much as we can,\" Hammond told Sky News.\n\nForecasts assume a US-UK trade deal\n\nMay's plan includes a transition period during which most trading rules for companies will remain the same. It would also mean a close relationship with the European Union on trade in financial services, and broad cooperation on transportation and energy.\n\nThe government's estimates are also based on other assumptions, including Britain's ability to strike \"ambitious\" free trade deals with major economies including the United States. That's far from guaranteed\n\nEconomists say the worst possible outcome would be a chaotic Brexit. Crashing out of the European Union would sink the UK economy into recession, analysts have warned.\n\n'No-deal' Brexit worse than 2008\n\nThe government said that leaving without a deal would result in the UK economy being 7.7% smaller 15 years after Brexit. That's compared to current trading arrangements, and assumes no change in immigration. The damage would be even greater if net migration from the European Union dropped to zero, the government said.\n\nSome key sectors of the economy would be especially hard hit by a messy Brexit. Official estimates show that the auto, chemicals and pharmaceutical industries, which trade heavily with the European Union, would be more than 20% smaller over the long run.\n\nThe Bank of England warned in its report that a disorderly Brexit would cause the UK economy to contract by 8%. The value of the pound would slump by as much as 25% and home prices could plummet 30%.\n\nThe economic fallout would be worse than Britain suffered because of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry said the government report shows that failing to secure a deal is not an option.\n\n\"It surely puts to bed some of the more far-fetched ideas that a hard landing Brexit will not seriously hurt the economy,\" said Rain Newton-Smith, the lobby group's chief economist."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Award-winning Chinese photographer Lu Guang disappears in Xinjiang, wife says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/Kq72SW2fHx0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An award-winning Chinese photojournalist has disappeared in China after reportedly being taken away by authorities in Xinjiang, a region in a global spotlight for the alleged internment of at least one million Muslim Uyghurs.\n\nLu Guang's disappearance was revealed by his wife, Xu Xiaoli, who posted news of his disappearance on social media and said that she had not been able to contact him since early November.\n\nIn her tweets and telephone conversation with CNN, she recounted that Lu was traveling in Xinjiang -- in northwest China -- on November 3 when she lost contact with him.

Once he was in custody, Los Angeles Police Department detectives obtained a DNA match to Little on the victims in three unsolved homicides from 1987 and 1989 and charged him with three counts of murder, the FBI said.\n\nThe victims, all women, had been beaten and then strangled, and their bodies were dumped in an alley, a dumpster and a garage, the FBI said. He pleaded his innocence but was convicted in 2014, the FBI said.\n\nAuthorities in Los Angeles passed his DNA on to the FBI's ViCAP program to get a full background on him, and ViCAP then reached out to the Texas Rangers to look into the killing of Denise Christie Brothers in Odessa.\n\nBland said Little provided details indicating that he was responsible for the death of Brothers, who was found strangled to death in a vacant parking lot two blocks away from a motel in January 1994.\n\nA grand jury returned an indictment against Little, according to Bland, on July 16. Little was extradited from California to Texas to face charges in the Brothers case. He appeared in Ector County court on Monday, CNN affiliate KWES reported .

No formal charges on any of the additional killings have yet been brought.\n\nNow in poor health, Little remains in custody in Odessa, and Holland has been conducting nearly daily interviews to get the most accurate and full picture of his confessions, the FBI said.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety has declined comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Former 'El Chapo' lieutenant testifies of serenade followed by 4th attempt on his life", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/1QckMlMxKuU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) The night before the final unsuccessful attempt on his life, a brass band outside the Mexican prison where Miguel Angel Martinez was being held ominously belted out a favorite number of alleged drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.\n\nMartinez was on the stand again Wednesday, recalling for a federal jury in Brooklyn the song with the you-only-live-once theme that played over and over within earshot of his cell.\n\nTo the former lieutenant and confidante of the world's biggest trafficker, the corrido ballad \"Un pu\u00f1o de tierra\" (A handful of earth) sent a clear message that day in 2000: \"Once you die, you take nothing with you.\"\n\nHours later, Martinez testified, the dark serenade was backed up by a gunman who entered the penitentiary. He placed the gun to the head of a prison guard stationed near Martinez' cell. The officer didn't have the cell key. The gunman then hurled two grenades at his target. Martinez survived by taking shelter behind the bathroom area.\n\nThe extradition of the cooperating witness to the United States in 2001 probably saved his life: Martinez has expressed he believes Guzman wanted him dead.\n\n\"I never failed him, never stole from him, never betrayed him,\" Martinez said of Guzman. \"I watched over all his family. The only thing I received was four attempted attacks against me.\"\n\nGuzman's defense lawyers objected to the statement. US District Judge Brian Cogan sustained the objection.\n\nCooperating witness says he never wanted to testify against 'El Chapo'\n\nGuzman, 61, has pleaded not guilty to charges of international drug trafficking and conspiracy to murder rivals.\n\nMartinez said during direct questioning that he never wanted to take the stand against Guzman.

One cellmate broke a baseball bat while hitting him.\n\nAfter surgery, Martinez testified, he was returned to the same cell, where he could hear his attackers polishing their blades at night. Months later, he was stabbed five to six times in the back. Again, he survived. At another prison, inmates asked him for his shoe size, suggesting he was already dead man. Martinez said that another time he was stabbed \"all over my face\" while making a phone call in the presence of a prison guard.\n\nMartinez testified that he worked for El Chapo in the Sinaloa cartel between 1986 and 1998. Starting on Monday, he described for the jury his experience working with Guzman as he said they moved drugs into the United States by airplane, tunnel, and truck.\n\nDefendant fixes glance on onetime associate\n\nGuzman, wearing a dark suit and tie, fixed his glance on Martinez during his testimony. The witness kept his eyes on his questioner.\n\nMartinez, known by his aliases \"El Gordo,\" \"El Compadre,\" or \"El Tololoche,\" identified Guzman as his boss and said he took orders from no one else at the cartel.\n\n\"\u00c9l era el jefe,\" he said, referring to Guzman -- \"He was the boss.\" They were associates, friends, and \"compadres,\" and El Chapo baptized Martinez's son in 1989. He first met El Chapo in late 1986 and last saw him in jail in Mexico in 1994.\n\nMartinez said he was a pilot for the cartel. He was responsible for receiving shipments of drugs from Colombia to Mexico for Guzman, and then those drugs would be sent to the United States. He personally flew in planes with drugs coming from Colombia and directed the Colombian pilot to clandestine landing strips near the Arizona border.\n\nThe prosecution witness said his responsibilities later grew, and Martinez opened a few offices for El Chapo in Mexico City. He started speaking directly to the Colombian cartels, organizing and receiving drug shipments, storing them, packaging them and sending them to the United States, all under orders from his boss, he testified.\n\nSometime around 1990, Guzman and others allegedly came up with a plan to smuggle cocaine to the United States in jalape\u00f1o pepper cans. They cloned the labels, logos, boxes and FDA license number of a real company sending cans of jalape\u00f1os into the country.\n\nShipment of pepper cans laden with cocaine ends up in L.A. store\n\nMartinez, on the stand, recalled learning at one point that a shipment of cans of peppers -- with cocaine inside -- made its way to a Los Angeles store, where a buyer discovered more than 35 pounds of cocaine in them.\n\nDefense attorney William Purpura, on cross-examination, sought to poke holes in Martinez's testimony.\n\nThe lawyer highlighted inconsistencies in Martinez's accounts during previous court appearances in his 18 years as a US government witness.

He was released after six years in return for cooperating at trials in California and Arizona.\n\n\"I started hating Guzman when he betrayed me and ordered someone to kill me,\" Martinez told Purpura at one point.\n\n\"Do you hate him enough to lie?\"\n\n\"No,\" Martinez replied.\n\nCross-examination continues on Thursday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump answers key Mueller questions on WikiLeaks and Trump Tower meeting", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/DxN7j0DOrwU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told special counsel Robert Mueller in writing that Roger Stone did not tell him about WikiLeaks, nor was he told about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son, campaign officials and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nOne source described the President's answers without providing any direct quotes and said the President made clear he was answering to the best of his recollection.\n\nThis is the first insight into how the President responded to the Mueller team's written questions -- a key unknown as Mueller aims to wrap up his investigation and prepare his final report.\n\nThese two points -- WikiLeaks and the Trump Tower meeting -- are critical to Mueller's central mission: investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe President's lawyers previously told CNN the answers would match his public statements.

MUST WATCH Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\n\nTrump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.\n\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.\n\n\"The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been \"upset for weeks\" about \"the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"\n\nDetails emerge\n\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.\n\nIn the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it \"totally false and deliberately libelous\" and Wikileaks was \"willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.\"\n\nThe paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.\n\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.\n\nIn another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.\n\nIf there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.\n\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been no talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.\n\nPotential impact\n\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.\n\n\"What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\" Ben-Veniste said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.\n\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.\n\n\"A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.\n\nIn the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.\n\nExpectations high\n\nThe latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.\n\nSpecial counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.\n\nMueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.\n\nSo expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public\n\n\"Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\" said Ben-Veniste.\n\nSuch a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\n\nThe new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.\n\nTrump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear the White House has said there has been no talk of Trump pardoning Manafort."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Donald Trump doesn't know nothing about nothing...", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/S3srIrJfp6Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) We know that President Donald Trump and lawyers submitted their written responses to special counsel Robert Mueller's questions this week.

President Donald Trump vowed to outlaw the devices soon after the tragedy, and some lawmakers on Capitol Hill urged him to back a permanent legislative fix.\n\nBut opposition from lawmakers and the National Rifle Association ultimately made a regulatory change the only realistic path forward to accomplishing the President's goal.\n\nThe devices make it easier to fire rounds from a semi-automatic weapon by harnessing the gun's recoil to \"bump\" the trigger faster -- an operation that caused officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives during the Obama administration to conclude that it's merely a gun accessory or firearm part, not subject to federal regulation.\n\nAt Trump's direction, however, the Justice Department submitted a proposed final rule earlier this year that upended the Obama-era interpretation, and concluded that bump-fire stocks, \"slide-fire\" devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics all fall within the prohibition on machine guns by allowing a \"shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger,\" and therefore, they are illegal under federal law.\n\nUnder the new rule, bump stock owners would be required to destroy or surrender the devices to authorities. Members of the public will be given 90 days to turn in or otherwise discard their bump stocks, according to a source familiar with the final rule.\n\n\"Bump stocks turn semiautomatic guns into illegal machine guns. This final rule sends a clear message: Illegal guns have no place in a law-and-order society, and we will continue to vigorously enforce the law to keep these illegal weapons off the street,\" a senior Justice Department official told CNN Wednesday.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, who are typically opposed to federal agencies writing regulations to accomplish what Congress hasn't directly legislated, had insisted that the Justice Department and ATF write a new regulation. Whereas some Democrats, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, have repeatedly cautioned that such a ban would likely result in lawsuits given ATF's earlier interpretation.\n\nATF Acting Director Thomas Brandon acknowledged in a Senate hearing this summer that he has been advised that banning bump fire stocks through executive regulation could lead to court challenges that would delay the implementation of a ban.\n\nTrump said last month he told the NRA \"bump stocks are gone,\" but how the group responds to the final rule remains to be seen. A spokesperson for the NRA said in October 2017 that the ATF \"should review bump-fire stocks to ensure they comply with federal law,\" but made clear it opposed the broader gun-control legislation raised by some in Congress.\n\nIn June, Slide Fire Solutions, the Texas company that invented the bump-fire stock device and was its lead manufacturer, announced on its website that it would stop taking orders for its products and would shut down its website.\n\nThe company, however, directs buyers to RW Arms, an arms dealer also based in Texas, which appears to be selling the remainder of Slide Fire's inventory. RW Arms was advertising for bump fire stocks made by Slide Fire as recently as this week, when they offered a Cyber Monday sale on the product. Slide Fire has not responded to repeated requests for comment about any potential litigation over a federal rule banning bump stocks."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "This town is like thousands that are vulnerable to contaminated water, with no fix in sight", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/pMbJqNWFWkI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Virginia Tech engineering Professor Marc Edwards watched as water flowed from a garden hose in Enterprise, Louisiana.

Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nHe has since received an EPA grant of nearly $2 million to seek out water issues in towns like Enterprise.\n\nThe EPA and the federal government do offer grants and loans to towns. But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right?

That means the August-born children would be among the youngest in their classrooms, sometimes nearly a year younger than other classmates.\n\n\"We saw nothing for any of the pairs of months apart from August to September, where we saw this big difference,\" said Layton, an assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \"We saw that this was only in states that had a September 1 cutoff. There was nothing in states that didn't have that.\"\n\nAccording to the Education Commission of the States , which the researchers used as their source, there are 21 states with this cutoff date, including Texas, Arizona and Illinois. The remaining 29 states and the District of Columbia have a range of enrollment cutoff dates, including December 2 in California and as late as January 1 in Vermont.\n\nLayton and his co-authors found that the rate of children with August birthdays who were diagnosed with ADHD was 34% higher than those born in September. Among the children born in August, 85.1 children per 10,000 had ADHD diagnoses, compared with just 63.6 per 10,000 born in September.\n\nChildren born in August also had a 32% higher rate of treatment for the condition than those born in September.\n\nADHD, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include trouble paying attention, being overly active and trouble controlling impulsive behaviors.\n\nIn 2016, approximately 9.4% US children -- 6.1 million -- between the ages of 2 and 17 had been diagnosed with ADHD at one point in their lives, the CDC said. About 3.3 million of these children were 12 to 17 years old, 2.4 million were 6 to 11, and 388,000 were 2 to 5, the CDC said.\n\nSome symptoms are normal behavior for children, but those with ADHD might not outgrow them. The symptoms can be severe and can cause difficulty at school, at home or with friends, the CDC said.\n\nChildren who are younger in their peer group, such as those with an August birthday in a school with a September 1 cutoff date, could be more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, Layton said, as certain childhood behaviors may be consistent with those that are used for diagnosis.\n\n\"Basically, normal childhood behaviors are being diagnosed as ADHD, and they are being treated for them, even though they are just normal kids. They just happen to be younger than their peers, and so they behave a little differently,\" he said.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis , director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, wrote in an email that \"This study confirms on a larger scale what other studies have shown on a smaller one. It confirms that there may be developmental confounders in the diagnosis of the condition and that the relative immaturity of young children's brains can make those that are merely younger at school entry demonstrate behaviors consistent with ADHD.\" Christakis was not involved in the research.\n\nJoel Nigg , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health and Science University, said that tracking the diagnoses through an insurance database allowed researchers to see what clinicians are doing, which can be more accurate than relying on parents' reports about their child's diagnosis.\n\nBut it could be a weakness, he said, in that \"we don't know how the clinicians are actually doing the diagnosis, how well they are following protocols,\" which could leave room for \"diagnostic bias related to age.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAlthough it's unlikely to lead to a big change in the results, Nigg and other researchers also noted that the study authors didn't determine whether the children were actually enrolled in school.\n\nEven with these limitations, Nigg believes that the study is valuable when looking at ADHD diagnoses.\n\n\"It's really helpful to continue to look at the what we can call sociological drivers of diagnosis. It really helps sort out real cases, where the child actually has a problem that needs to be treated, versus sort of circumstantial cases that may be normal development that only looks bad because of the situation the child is in,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Chinese scientist publicly defends work on genetically edited babies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/qZ07z-1RCJs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) The Chinese scientist who sparked an international outcry after alleging to have helped create the world's first genetically edited babies has raised the possibility of a third child being born, after announcing that a separate woman was pregnant at an early stage with a modified embryo.\n\nSpeaking in front of a packed hall of about 700 people Wednesday at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, He Jiankui publicly defended his work, saying he felt \"proud\" of his achievement.\n\nHe, an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, sent shock waves through the scientific community on Monday when he announced in a video online that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.\n\n\"For this specific case, I feel proud.

Here's what happened.\n\nWill the UK be worse off under the prime minister's Brexit plans or not? That was the question Jeremy Corbyn wanted answering at this session, after the Treasury published an analysis suggesting the UK would be less well off under all Brexit options when compared with staying in the EU.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said Mrs May's deal would mitigate \"most\" of the negative impacts of Brexit, said the Labour leader. Which of the negative impacts would not be mitigated?\n\nMrs May said her deal was the best available to protect the economy and \"honour\" the EU referendum result. The \"biggest risk\" to the economy was a Labour government, she added.\n\n\"It is not hard to be the best deal if it is the only deal,\" observed the Labour leader, \"by definition it is also the worst\".\n\nIn fact, he went on, there was no deal \"just a 26-page wish list\".\n\nReferring to Philip Hammond saying the UK would be \"slightly worse off\" under the prime minister's deal, Mr Corbyn noted the chancellor's absence from the front bench and asked if Mrs May agreed with his remarks.\n\nMrs May said: \"The analysis shows the deal we have negotiated is the best deal for the economy and delivers on the results of the referendum.\n\n\"He calls the political declaration a wish list, but this is an ambitious, broad and flexible partnership,\" she added.\n\n\"The Labour Party has six bullet points to offer. My weekend shopping list is longer than that.\"\n\nThe Labour leader quoted a damning UN report, which had said it was \"clear\" the impact of Brexit on people in poverty was an \"after-thought\".\n\nIf the PM's deal was so great, he asked, why were MPs \"not queuing up\" to back it?\n\nFarmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland and employers in Northern Ireland were backing it, claimed the prime minister.\n\nShe defended the government's economic record, saying figures today showed the number of children living in workless households was \"at a record low\".\n\nMr Corbyn quoted the UN report again, which said there were 14 million people living in poverty in the UK. He then quoted business leaders, who had said her Brexit deal was the \"worst of all worlds\".\n\nShe had gone from \"guaranteeing frictionless trade, to offering friction and less trade\", said the Labour leader, and the country had \"no faith\" in the next stage of talks being completed within two years.\n\nDid the PM prefer \"extending the transition with further vast payments to the European Union or falling into the backstop with no exit\", asked Mr Corbyn.\n\nThere is an exit \"from the backstop\", said Mrs May, and it was \"perfectly possible\" to turn the 26-page political declaration into legal text within two years.\n\nThen it was on to the attorney general's legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, which Labour wants published in full.\n\nMrs May had petitioned Tony Blair for the full legal advice on the Iraq war to be published, said Mr Corbyn, what has changed?\n\nMrs May cited client confidentiality and said MPs would get to see a \"full reasoned position statement\" and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement and answer MPs questions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn asks the PM why she does not practise what she preached\n\nMr Corbyn said the government was the most shambolic \"in living memory\" and 20 of her own ministers had resigned.\n\nIt was \"clear that Parliament will not back this plan\", he told the PM and it was time for her to \"accept that reality, make way for an alternative plan that can work for the whole country\".\n\nMrs May said she \"will take no lectures\" from someone who has had more than \"100 resignations\" from his frontbench.\n\nShe said \"what really lies behind Labour's approach\" was a desire to \"cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people... that would be a betrayal of the many by the few\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May says Labour wants to \"cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people\"\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford also made hay with Philip Hammond's comments on the economic impact of Theresa May's Brexit plans.\n\nLabour's Louise Ellmann called for another EU referendum.\n\nDover Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke asked about border security after \"unprecedented\" numbers of migrants crossed the English Channel.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Elphicke tells the PM to \"invest more in border security\" over migrants crossing the English Channel\n\nConservative MP Zac Goldsmith asked if the prime minister had \"personally intervened\" to stop the UK offering sanctuary to a Pakistani Christian.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zac Goldsmith: Did Theresa May stop UK offering Asia Bibi sanctuary?\n\nTheresa May told SNP\u2019s Douglas Chapman the government has been working with devolved administrations to ensure \"the voice of the devolved administrations has been heard\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption SNP MP Douglas Chapman on lessons from Brexit negotiations that will help Scotland dissolve the Act of Union.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nAfter the PM endured another 45 minutes at the dispatch box, dodging the Brexit crossfire from the opposition and her own party's various factions, what have we learned?\n\nTheresa May stuck by her line that the government would not release the full text of its legal advice on the Brexit deal - no surprise, really, and it would have been a bit of a surrender and a dangerous precedent, had she agreed.\n\nInstead she said the government's top lawyer, the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, could make a statement to MPs, and answer questions.\n\nDid the answer to Labour's Dame Louise Ellman signal some subtle softening on the issue of a second referendum?\n\nThe PM has rebuffed endless requests for a so-called \"People's Vote\" over the last few weeks, usually observing that there has already been a referendum, and often adding that the main parties at the last election promised to respect the result.\n\nThis time the prime minister did say that it was important to deliver on the decision of the people, but also added that there would not be time to hold a further referendum before Brexit Day - 29 March - as the Article 50 period (the period before the UK left, having given notice of intent to withdraw) would have to be extended.\n\nRandom variation of phrase, or a soft signal of some kind? Hmmm.\n\nJeremy Corbyn enjoyed himself in a target-rich environment, noting that Theresa May once demanded that Tony Blair published his advice on the legality of the Iraq War, and highlighting the opposition to her Brexit deal among her own MPs.\n\nBut the real threat to the PM was behind her, on the Conservative benches. Brexiteers Anne Marie Trevelyan, Peter Bone and David Amess all attacked aspects of the deal, and received polite rebuffs.\n\nAnd the Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross raised the dangers of a fisheries deal which did not meet promises to the fishing industry.\n\nThe PM sailed through it all\u2026 this was much of a muchness with the questioning in the series of Brexit statements over the last fortnight. And perhaps the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu drained some of the hostility from this latest repeat performance.\n\nHard Brexiteers to the right of her, Remainers to the left, Labour with its cannons trained on her, and leadership rivals lurking under camouflage, the PM seems to be heading for certain defeat in the Meaningful Vote in a fortnight.\n\nYet on she goes.\n\nWestminster is, frankly, a bit baffled.\n\nDoes she have some masterstroke to deploy?

So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground.\n\nGetting to this point would require large cuts in emissions from the current position.

Energy efficiency measures such as home insulation would also need to be boosted to reduce energy consumption by half by the middle of the century.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"With this plan, Europe will be the world's first major economy to go for net-zero emissions by 2050,\" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete. \"We have all the tools to be ambitious.\"\n\nThe EU believes that the measures will help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement will be expensive but will boost economies by 2% of GDP by 2050 and reduce energy imports by over 70%, saving up to three trillion euros a year.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe IPCC report on keeping temperatures below 1.5C was a \"wake-up call\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete. Reports in recent days have also underlined just how far the gap has grown between what countries promised to do under the Paris agreement, and how far they've gotten with those endeavours.\n\nThe UN emissions gap study also showed that the majority of rich countries are not on track to meet their carbon cutting commitments by 2030.\n\nWith global climate talks due to start in a few days in Poland the EU's move, although still a strategy and not a firm commitment, will be welcome news.\n\n\"If we do not lead, no one else will,\" said Mr Ca\u00f1ete.\n\nIs everyone in Europe happy with the new strategy?\n\nNot quite. Some countries such as Germany are struggling with their current commitments and are worried that further cuts would threaten their industries. Others such as Poland are still reliant on coal and would object to even more stringent restrictions on the use of fossil fuels.\n\nSome countries though are keen to press ahead - a group of ten, including Denmark, Sweden and Spain have written a letter to the EU asking for a \"clear direction\" towards net-zero emissions.\n\nClimate campaigners say the step, though welcome, doesn't go far enough fast enough.\n\nThey are worried that there is no plan to increase the intermediate targets for 2030, which many scientists say is crucial.

With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap.\n\nThe study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path.\n\nThe future is fiscal?\n\nThe report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions.\n\nIt says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets\n\n\"When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,\" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist.\n\n\"If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030.

As the Earth warmed up and started to emerge from the Ice Age around 40,000 years ago, grasslands started to shrink, likely pushing the animal to extinction.\n\nHundreds of large mammal species disappeared after the last Ice Age, due to climate change, loss of vegetation and human hunting.\n\nWhat does it tell us about the fate of modern rhinos?\n\nToday there are just five remaining species of rhino.

President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that \"to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers.\"\n\nInSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the \"biggest parking lot on Mars\".\n\nThe first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings.\n\nThe image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon.\n\nA later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance\n\nWhat happened in the landing?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California\n\nLike all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair.\n\nStage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress.\n\nIt had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop.\n\nInSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent.\n\nThe robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing.\n\nOne of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander.\n\nIt was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions.\n\nAnd as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars.\n\n\"Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,\" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth\n\nWhat is different about the InSight mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German-led \"mole\" system will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Banerdt: \"Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries\"\n\nWhy do we need to know this?\n\nScientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time.\n\nInSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: \"The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Spectators gathered in New York's Times Square to watch the landing\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "2078 Nancy Pelosi Hologram Nominated For 38th Term In House As Party Leader", "article_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/nancy-pelosi-hologram-nominated-for-38th-term-in-house-1830726115", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "The Onion | Politics\n\nDepressed Mueller Wonders What It Is About Him That Makes Everyone Lie To Him"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Millennials No Longer Living With Parents", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/millennials-no-longer-living-with-parents-1830724779", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "A survey conducted by EY found that the percentage of millennials living with parents plunged to 16 percent from 30 percent in 2016, while home ownership has risen from 26 percent to 40 percent.

At least 20 percent of all incidents were linked to anti-religious bias.\n\nIt also said that anti-Semitic incidents had increased by 37 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe FBI report corroborated earlier findings published in May by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, that found that hate crimes reported to the police in the country\u2019s largest cities had increased by 12.5 percent in 2017.\n\nThe report concluded that in New York City, home to 1.1 million Jews and considered the largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, the community \"have consistently been the top target and the overwhelming majority of anti-Semitic attacks in the ten largest cities\".\n\nIn early November, police arrested a suspect for vandalizing a Brooklyn synagogue with pro-Nazi slogans earlier in the month. The man had written \"Hitler,\" \"Jews better be ready\" and \"Die Jew rats\"."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Georgia ruling party candidate Zurabishv wins presidential runoff", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/georgia-ruling-party-candidate-zurabishv-wins-presidential-runoff-181129063900787.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Georgia's ruling party-backed candidate, who favours balancing the ex-Soviet republic's relations with Moscow and the West, has won the presidential runoff, according to partial results published on the electoral body's website on Thursday.\n\nFigures from the Central Election Commission gave French-born Salome Zurabishvili 59.6 percent of the vote in the runoff, which was held on Wednesday.\n\nOpposition candidate Grigol Vashadze had 40.4 percent, based on results from almost all polling stations, the CEC said.\n\nEarlier, two exit polls also showed Zurabishvili, a former French career diplomat who served as Georgia's foreign minister from 2004 to 2005, with a clear lead.\n\nThe second round of voting was under close scrutiny by the opposition and international observers for any sign that the ruling Georgian Dream party is using its control of state machinery to help Zurabishvili win.\n\nThe opposition said there have been attacks on its activists during campaigning and complained there were many irregularities during the vote, including attempts to pressure voters and manipulation of voter lists.\n\nThe ruling party has denied attempting to influence the outcome of the vote unfairly.\n\nInternational observers said the first round of voting last month had been competitive but had been held on \"an unlevel playing field\" with state resources misused, private media biased, and some phoney candidates taking part.\n\nVashadze, who was foreign minister from 2008 to 2012, had been expected to use the presidency's limited powers to send a vocal message of integration with the US-led NATO alliance and the European Union - sensitive issues in the South Caucasus country that fought a war in 2008 with its neighbour Russia.\n\nGeorgian Dream and Zurabishvili take a more pragmatic line, balancing the country's aspirations to move closer to the West with a desire to avoid antagonising the Kremlin.\n\nConstitutional changes have reduced the authority of the president and put most levers of power in the hands of the prime minister, a Georgian Dream loyalist.\n\nThe election was the last in which the president will be selected by popular vote. From 2024, presidents will be picked by an electoral college of 300 legislators and regional officials.\n\nZurabishvili won 38.6 percent of the vote in the first round on October 28. That was just one percentage point ahead of Vashadze in a resolutely pro-Western government that was in power when the conflict with Russia broke out over a Moscow-backed breakaway Georgian territory.\n\nGeorgian Dream was founded by billionaire banker Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, and critics say he rules the country from behind the scenes.\n\nZurabishvili's supporters say she would bring international stature to the presidency.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Suicide, Overdoses Help Cut US Life Expectancy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-overdoses-help-cut-us-life-expectancy/4679288.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Suicides and drug overdoses helped lead a surge in U.S. deaths last year, and drove a continuing decline in how long Americans are expected to live.\n\nOverall, there were more than 2.8 million U.S. deaths in 2017, or nearly 70,000 more than the previous year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. It was the most deaths in a single year since the government began counting more than a century ago.\n\nThe increase partly reflects the nation\u2019s growing and aging population. But it\u2019s deaths in younger age groups \u2014 particularly middle-aged people \u2014 that have had the largest impact on calculations of life expectancy, experts said.\n\nThe suicide death rate last year was the highest it\u2019s been in at least 50 years, according to U.S. government records. There were more than 47,000 suicides, up from a little less than 45,000 the year before.\n\n\u200bA general decline\n\nFor decades, U.S. life expectancy was on the upswing, rising a few months nearly every year. Now it\u2019s trending the other way: It fell in 2015, stayed level in 2016, and declined again last year, the CDC said.\n\nThe nation is in the longest period of a generally declining life expectancy since the late 1910s, when World War I and the worst flu pandemic in modern history combined to kill nearly 1 million Americans. Life expectancy in 1918 was 39.\n\nAside from that, \u201cwe\u2019ve never really seen anything like this,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s 10 leading causes of death, only the cancer death rate fell in 2017. Meanwhile, there were increases in seven others: suicide, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, flu/pneumonia, chronic lower respiratory diseases and unintentional injuries.\n\nAn underlying factor is that the death rate for heart disease, the nation\u2019s No. 1 killer, has stopped falling. In years past, declines in heart disease deaths were enough to offset increases in some other kinds of death, but no longer, Anderson said.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s numbers do sometimes change. This week, CDC officials said they had revised their life expectancy estimate for 2016 after some additional data came in.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this?\n\nCDC officials did not speculate about what\u2019s behind declining life expectancy, but Dr. William Dietz, a disease prevention expert at George Washington University, sees a sense of hopelessness.\n\nFinancial struggles, a widening income gap and divisive politics are all casting a pall over many Americans, he suggested.\n\n\u201cI really do believe that people are increasingly hopeless, and that that leads to drug use, it leads potentially to suicide,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nDrug overdose deaths also continued to climb, surpassing 70,000 last year, in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. The death rate rose 10 percent from the previous year, smaller than the 21 percent jump seen between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite a cause for celebration, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s starting to slow down, but it hasn\u2019t turned around yet,\u2019\u2019 Rowe said. \u201cI think it will take several years.\u201d\n\nAccidental drug overdoses account for more than a third of the unintentional injury deaths, and intentional drug overdoses account for about a tenth of the suicides, said Dr. Holly Hedegaard, a CDC injury epidemiologist.\n\nOther findings\n\nThe CDC figures are based mainly on a review of 2017 death certificates. The life expectancy figure is based on current death trends and other factors.\n\nThe agency also said:"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "What Underlies US-China Tensions Ahead of Crucial G-20 Meeting?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/china-us-g-20-summit/4679282.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Argentina this week for what some see as the most important meeting in years between the leaders of the world's two largest economies.\n\nAfter months of bitter bickering between their governments over trade and security that has raised questions about the very future of a complex but economically pivotal relationship, the two leaders took a step back from the edge with an ice-breaking telephone call early this month.\n\nThey expressed optimism about resolving their damaging trade war ahead of the meeting on Saturday, but there have been few tangible signs of progress. They will be in Buenos Aires for the summit of the leaders of the 20 major economies.\n\nEven so, differences among Trump's top advisers over China policy and his personal unpredictability and fondness for headline-grabbing moments mean it remains anyone's guess what the Trump-Xi meeting might bring.\n\nWhat caused the trade war?\n\nTrump railed against the massive U.S. trade deficit with China during his 2016 election campaign and after a year in office, with no sign of the gap narrowing, the U.S. president attacked the issue head-on.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to force concessions on a list of demands that would fundamentally change the two countries' terms of trade. China has responded with tariffs of its own on U.S. goods, targeting farm states that are an important part of Trump's political base.\n\nTrump has threatened tariffs on another $267 billion worth of Chinese products, including cell phones, computers, clothing and footwear. And 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise to a more prohibitive 25 percent on Jan. 1, 2019 unless a truce is agreed.\n\nWashington wants Beijing to act to reduce a $375 billion trade surplus by opening its economy to foreign competition, increasing protection for U.S. intellectual property, ending joint venture requirements that lead to technology transfers and cutting subsidies to state-owned industries.\n\nIt particularly wants to prevent exports to China of advanced technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics and has tightened rules on foreign investment in 27 sensitive sectors to stop Chinese deals.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department recently charged China state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co with conspiring to steal trade secrets in what is expected to be the first of several similar cases to attempt to stop the flow of intellectual property into China.\n\nU.S. officials say China has delivered a written response to U.S. demands for wide-ranging trade reforms, but they remain doubtful this will be enough to bring about a breakthrough when Xi and Trump meet.\n\nHow serious is the US-China security rivalry?\n\nIn the past 20 years China has grown rapidly to become arguably Washington's biggest security rival, with defense spending that now far outstrips former Cold War rival Russia. A hundred years after the end of World War One, some academics have even warned of another \"Thucydides Trap\" - a theory that sees a risk of rivalry between a rising and an established power spiraling into open conflict.\n\nRecent years have seen a steady uptick in tensions, punctuated by U.S. naval and air patrols challenging China's extensive claims in the South China Sea and U.S. warship movements through the highly sensitive Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile the two sides have taken care to maintain military-to-military contacts, close encounters have raised fears that an accidental clash could escalate into an unexpected conflict - particularly over Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province and a \"red line\" not to be crossed.\n\nTrump added new uncertainty when he said the United States would quit a Cold-War era treaty with Russia that has prevented Washington from stationing ground-based intermediate-range missiles in Asia as well as Europe.\n\nIn what was billed as a major policy speech on Oct. 4, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence escalated Washington's trade-driven pressure campaign, highlighting Chinese military and industrial espionage activity and accusing China of \"malign\" efforts to undermine Trump in the Nov. 6 mid-term congressional elections. He offered no concrete evidence of that.\n\nIs the current trend reversible?\n\nWhite House insiders say there remain substantial differences within the Trump administration over how far to push China.\n\nThis division groups anti-China hardliner and trade adviser Peter Navarro, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and those who favor a complete reevaluation of the relationship on one side. On the other are pragmatists led by White House chief economist Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, concerned about the harm deepening friction could do to the U.S. economy and markets.\n\nIn Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric and persistent criticism of the damaging effect he says Chinese trade practices have on America, he has appeared to favor Navarro's school of thought. But he has also shown himself very aware of the immediately positive effects any indication of an improved mood with Beijing can have on U.S. financial markets and his ratings for handling of the economy at a time when he is under fire on other domestic fronts."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Waived FBI Checks on Staff at Camp for Migrant Teens", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-waived-fbi-checks-on-staff-at-camp-for-migrant-teens/4679280.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration has put the safety of thousands of teens at a migrant detention camp at risk by waiving FBI fingerprint checks for their caregivers and short-staffing mental health workers, according to an Associated Press investigation and a new federal watchdog report.\n\nNone of the 2,100 staffers at a tent city holding more than 2,300 teens in the remote Texas desert are going through rigorous FBI fingerprint background checks, according to a Health and Human Services inspector general memo published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cInstead, Tornillo is using checks conducted by a private contractor that has access to less comprehensive data, thereby heightening the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children,\u201d the memo says.\n\nIn addition, the federal government is allowing the nonprofit running the facility, BCFS Health and Human Services, to sidestep mental health care requirements. Under federal policy, migrant youth shelters generally must have one mental health clinician for every 12 kids, but the federal agency\u2019s contract with BCFS allows it to staff Tornillo with just one clinician for every 100 children. That\u2019s not enough to provide adequate mental health care, the inspector general office said in the memo.\n\nBCFS said it has one mental health clinician for every 50 children at Tornillo.\n\n\u200bTemporary shelter becoming permanent\n\nThe Trump administration announced in June it would open a temporary shelter for up to 360 migrant children in this isolated corner of Texas. Less than six months later, the facility has expanded into a detention camp holding thousands of teenagers, and it shows every sign of becoming more permanent.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mark Weber, said no decisions have been made about when Tornillo will close.\n\nBy Tuesday, 2,324 mostly Central American boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 17 were sleeping inside the highly guarded facility in rows of bunk beds in canvas tents.\n\nThe teens at Tornillo weren\u2019t separated from their families at the border this summer. Almost all the teens came on their own hoping to join family members in the United States. Most are never charged with a crime; crossing illegally into the U.S. is a civil offense.\n\nBy law, migrant children traveling alone into the U.S. must be sent to a government shelter where they stay until they can be united with relatives or other sponsors while awaiting immigration court hearings. Migrant children\u2019s time in government custody has grown longer, in part because of the Trump administration\u2019s new requirements for deep background checks on sponsors who agree to take in young immigrants. That has resulted in the detention of a record 14,000 migrant children.\n\nSome children have been detained at Tornillo since it opened in June. As the population inside the tall wire fences swells, the young detainees\u2019 anguish has deepened.\n\n\u201cThe few times they let me call my mom I would tell her that one day I would be free, but really I felt like I would be there for the rest of my life,\u201d a 17-year-old from Honduras who was held at Tornillo earlier this year told AP. \u201cI feel so bad for the kids who are still there. What if they have to spend Christmas there? They need a hug, and nobody is allowed to hug there.\u201d\n\nAfter his family passed extensive background checks, the teen was recently released to them, but said he still has nightmares he\u2019s back inside. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from immigration authorities.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have anything to hide\u2019\n\nBy day, minders walk the teens to their meals, showers and recreation. At night the area around the camp, that\u2019s grown to more than 150 tents, is secured and lighted by flood lights.\n\nThe nonprofit social service agency contracted to run Tornillo says it is proud of its work. It says it is operating the facility with the same precision and care used for shelters put up after natural disasters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to hide. This is an exceptionally run operation,\u201d said Krista Piferrer, a spokeswoman for BCFS Health and Human Services. \u201cThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo.\u201d\n\n\u200bNo fingerprint checks\n\nIn June, as detention centers for migrant children overflowed, Scott Lloyd, director of HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement, signed a memo granting BCFS a waiver to staff up Tornillo without the required child abuse and neglect checks, which raise a red flag about any job candidate with a record of hurting a child. According to the inspector general, the agency was under pressure to open the detention camp quickly, and Lloyd\u2019s agency assumed Tornillo staff had undergone FBI fingerprint checks. They had not.\n\nTwo days after Lloyd waived the safety checks, BCFS opened the tent city. Lloyd, under fire for his handling of the migrant crisis, was transferred out of the refugee resettlement branch and to a different division of HHS last week.\n\nSince the facility opened, BCFS has been checking job candidates\u2019 national and local criminal histories and doing multi-state sex offender registry checks, Piferrer said.\n\nBCFS has filed more than 30 reports on \u201csignificant incidents\u201d at Tornillo since June, including some involving interactions between the children and staff, but none of a sexual nature, Piferrer said.\n\nFBI fingerprint background checks can be completed in a few minutes and reveal much more information about job candidates than checks that simply run a person\u2019s name against criminal history databases, said Jeffrey Harp, a retired FBI assistant special agent in charge.\n\n\u201cHow do you know the person is who they say they are unless you do a fingerprint check? They can\u2019t lie about their fingerprints, but they can lie about their name or take on someone else\u2019s identity who has a crystal clean record,\u201d Harp told AP. \u201cMore and more employers are finding out they have an employee who is problematic only after the fact, and that\u2019s because their employment screening isn\u2019t really comprehensive.\u201d\n\nBCFS, a San Antonio nonprofit, runs Tornillo as it operates evacuation centers for hurricanes: There\u2019s food, first aid, activities and bunk beds, but no formal school, therapy or unsupervised stretches.\n\nMental health needs\n\nFederal officials have said repeatedly that only children without special needs were being sent to Tornillo. But facility administrators recently acknowledged that the Tornillo detainees included children with serious mental health issues who needed to be transferred to facilities in El Paso, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion who spoke on a condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is found to have a mental health need that cannot be best provided for at Tornillo, a request is made to HHS to transfer the child to a more appropriate facility,\u201d said Piferrer.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Carll, a teen and trauma specialist who heads the American Psychological Association\u2019s Refugee Mental Health resource network, said institutionalizing so many teens in a geographically remote place makes it harder to recruit qualified clinicians.\n\nMaking things worse, Carll said migrant youth are likely to have higher emotional needs after going through hardship, enduring the journey north and being held in detention. They would do better if placed with trained, bilingual foster families, she said.\n\n\u200b$1,200 per night\n\nAn AP investigation has found that the camp\u2019s rapid growth has created serious problems, including costs that appear to be soaring more than 50 percent higher than the government has disclosed. What began as an emergency, 30-day shelter has transformed into a vast tent city that could cost taxpayers more than $430 million.\n\nFor each night each child spends at Tornillo, taxpayers spend up to $1,200 to pay the direct care workers, cooks, cleaners, teachers and emergency services workers, according to information staff at two congressional offices said they were provided on a recent visit. That\u2019s well above the $775 officials have publicly disclosed, and close to five times more than a typical youth migrant shelter costs.\n\nBCFS did not dispute the cost, but said on average, actual costs are closer to $750 a day, which would bring current operations to more than $12 million a week.\n\nThe costs at Tornillo are so high because everything, water, sewage, food, staff and detainees, must be trucked in and out of the remote site.\n\n\u201cEverything that is being provided has been directed by the federal government to be provided,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "New Rule Puts US Trafficking Victims at Higher Risk of Deportation", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/human-trafficking-deportation/4679274.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "A U.S. agency is taking steps to deport people who were trafficked illegally into the country if they cannot prove their ordeal, a move likely to have a chilling effect on victims coming forward, experts said on Wednesday.\n\nVictims of human trafficking can apply for a special \"T visa\" that allows them to stay in the country, receive government benefits and even put them on the path to U.S. citizenship, according to anti-trafficking experts.\n\nAbout 1,000 people apply for the visa each year, with 70 percent being granted, according to the U.S. government.

It is rather a surrender to the militias \u2026 which we can\u2019t accept,\u201d Al-Shaif added.\n\nPompeo, Mattis brief lawmakers\n\nTalking to U.S. lawmakers, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday urged the preservation of Washington\u2019s support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.\n\nThe top U.S diplomat and the top defense official said a hasty U.S. withdrawal from Yemen would allow Iran to further strengthen its grip on the country, and that would be problematic for the region and the world.\n\nPompeo also strongly objected to the Senate resolution describing it as \u201cpoorly timed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPassing a resolution at this point undermines that [peace effort]. It would encourage the Houthis [Yemeni rebels].

Since then the conflict become a humanitarian crisis, with tens of thousands of casualties and severe famine threatening the lives of millions of civilians including children.\n\n\u200bTribes\u2019 role\n\nNadwa Al-Dawsari, the Yemen country director for the Center for Civilians in Conflict, a Washington-based organization working for the protection of civilians in armed conflict, told VOA that tribes could play a crucial role and are a fundamental pillar of Yemeni society and wrongfully depicted as lawless and anti-state.\n\n\u201cIn reality, tribes operate according to customary rules that govern the relationship between individuals and their tribes, among tribes and between tribes and the state,\u201d Al-Dawsari said.\n\n\u201cIn the absent of the state, customary law has helped maintain order and security, prevented and resolve conflicts. Yemeni tribes have always co-existed and even collaborated with the government,\u201d she added.\n\nSome analysts like Khaled Fattah, an expert on Yemen and tribes in the Arab World, charge that ignoring tribes, specially their youths, could even be problematic.\n\n\u201cTribal youth are locked in a harsh environment of deprivation and conflict, and lack of access to almost everything from political participation and education to sport and recreational facilities,\u201d Fattah said.\n\n\u201cMobile phones and internet into tribal areas resulted not only in exposing tribal youth to the ideology of violent extremism, but also in creating a wide psychological distance between their offline and online lives,\u201d Fattah added.\n\nFattah said tribes are politically and military significant in Yemen as they have access to weapons.\n\n\u201cIn these markets, all sorts of weapons from AK-47 to bazookas and anti-aircraft missiles are available. Prior to the Saudi-led military operations, it was estimated that Yemeni tribes have five times more small arms than the central government in Sanaa,\u201d Fattah added.\n\nAQAP\n\nHowever, Al- Dawsari said tribes have served as frontline defenders against terror groups like al-Qaida.\n\nShe did acknowledge that the presence of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is a challenge in the region, but said they have no havens among Yemeni tribes.\n\n\u201cIt is the tribes that have denied AQAP the ability to expand territory. AQAP was only able to make significant influence in parts of Yemen where the tribal structure is weak or nonexistent,\u201d Al-Dawsari said.\n\n\u201cSome tribesmen joined AQAP but in doing so, they have acted independent of and against the wish and interest of their tribes,\u201d she added.\n\nHouthis\n\nYemeni tribe leader, Al-Shaif said the Yemeni tribes see the Houthi movement, which has overthrown the government, as a terrorist movement as well.\n\n\u201cThe Houthis committed unprecedented abuses against local tribes, including abduction, forced disappearance, torture, killing of tribal leaders, and blowing up homes of their opponents,\u201d Al-Shaif said.\n\nAl-Shaif said that most of the tribes in Yemen do not trust the Saudi-led Arab coalition either because it failed to restore peace in provinces that are under government control.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust the Arab coalition anymore.

Votes were still being counted, but she was assured of victory.\n\nWATCH: Pelosi Expresses Confidence She Will Be House Speaker Again\n\n\u201cAre there dissenters? Yes,\u201d the California Democrat told reporters as voting was underway. \u201cBut I expect to have a powerful vote going forward.\u201d\n\nPelosi was nominated as her party\u2019s choice for speaker by Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, with no fewer than eight colleagues set to second the choice, including Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights leader, and three newly elected lawmakers.\n\nAs House Democrats met in private in the Capitol, they faced a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d choice on the ballots.\n\nA sign of the party\u2019s mood emerged early as the House Democrats elected Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York as caucus chairman, elevating the charismatic 48-year-old from the Congressional Black Caucus as a new generation of leaders pushes to the forefront.\n\nHis slim victory in that race, 123-113, over veteran Rep. Barbara Lee of California, another influential member of the Black Caucus, offered a window into the shifting landscape. Flanked by top progressive leaders, Lee made her pitch during the closed session, drawing on the record number of women, including minority women, who ran for office and are entering the new Congress.\n\nThe majority, though, went to Jeffries who used his speech to remind Democrats of their core accomplishments \u2014 from passage of the Civil Rights Act to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 before pivoting to his vision for the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on standing up for everyone \u2014 white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American \u2014 every single American deserves us, here in the United States Congress to work, Democrats and Republicans, on their behalf to make their life better,\u201d he said afterward.\n\nDemocrats regrouped for an afternoon session, and voting that includes various caucus positions could stretch on for hours.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues ahead of voting, Pelosi gave a nod to those clamoring for change.\n\n\u201cWe all agree that history is in a hurry, and we need to accelerate the pace of change in Congress,\u201d she wrote, noting the \u201chistoric\u201d class of new first-term lawmakers, the largest since Watergate, who led Democrats to the majority in the midterm election.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to recognize the myriad of talent and tools at our disposal to take us in to the future by showcasing the idealism, intellect and imagination of our caucus,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPelosi\u2019s opponents had pledged to usher in a new era for Democrats. But one by one, the powerful California congresswoman picked off the would-be challengers and smoothed skeptics. In the end, there was no one willing, or able, to mount a serious campaign against her bid to reclaim the speaker\u2019s job, which she held from 2007 to 2011, before the GOP took back the majority.\n\nPelosi still lacks the vote tally she\u2019ll need in January, when the new Congress convenes, to ascend to the post.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t beat someone with no one,'' said Rep.-elect Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., who explained in a statement that she came to Washington eager to hear from colleagues and \u201chopeful that many candidates would step up to the plate.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cthe only person that declared their intentions, spoke to me about their vision and asked me for my vote is Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were poised to return their entire top leadership team, including Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland in the No. 2 spot as majority leader and Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as whip. They were running unopposed.\n\nPlenty of newcomers were set to fill the down-ballot slots\n\nThose trying to oust Pelosi say they always knew the internal caucus election would fall in her favor. She only needed a simple majority of Democrats, who have a 233-seat majority, with several races still undecided, to win the nomination.\n\nBut she'll need 218 votes in January, half the full 435-seat House, which is harder, if all Republicans vote against her, as is likely \u2014 though she could win with fewer votes if some lawmakers are absent or vote present.\n\nRep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., played down the significance of Wednesday\u2019s caucus vote and said the true fight for House speaker will occur in January.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to make a big play of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's Jan. 3.\u201d\n\nSeveral factions within the Democratic caucus in the House worked against Pelosi, but they failed to gain ground in recent days. Still, there seem to be more than enough votes to stop Pelosi in January. Some say only with a floor fight in view will new leaders emerge. They say there are plenty of Democrats on the bench who could step up to the job.\n\nBut Pelosi's ability to stand unopposed Wednesday, despite the threats from within and reams of attack ads against her, showed the staying power of her brand of machine politics.\n\n\u201cThe reality is there is no alternative,\u201d said Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., who had signed on to the letter opposing her but reversed course after Pelosi tapped him to lead his effort to expand Medicare options to those age 50 to 65.\n\nShe was the female speaker and hopes to return to a role few men have had twice \u2014 most recently, legendary Speaker Sam Rayburn a half-century ago.\n\nBetween now and January, Pelosi will work the levers of power by doling out the many committee seat assignments, subcommittee chairmanships and other perks she is able to offer, or withhold, as incentives to win over supporters."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Rwandan Dissident Draws US Congressional Support", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rwandan-dissident-draws-us-congressional-support/4678705.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. congressional lawmakers are pressing Rwanda's government against incarcerating dissident politician Diane Rwigara, who faces up to 22 years in prison after being convicted of inciting insurrection and forgery.\n\nDiane Rwigara, a former presidential candidate, is scheduled to be sentenced December 6, along with her mother, Adeline Rwigara.

It was the most deaths in a single year since the government began counting more than a century ago.\n\nThe increase partly reflects the nation\u2019s growing and aging population. But it\u2019s deaths in younger age groups \u2014 particularly middle-aged people \u2014 that have had the largest impact on calculations of life expectancy, experts said.\n\nThe suicide death rate last year was the highest it\u2019s been in at least 50 years, according to U.S. government records. There were more than 47,000 suicides, up from a little less than 45,000 the year before.\n\n\u200bA general decline\n\nFor decades, U.S. life expectancy was on the upswing, rising a few months nearly every year. Now it\u2019s trending the other way: It fell in 2015, stayed level in 2016, and declined again last year, the CDC said.\n\nThe nation is in the longest period of a generally declining life expectancy since the late 1910s, when World War I and the worst flu pandemic in modern history combined to kill nearly 1 million Americans. Life expectancy in 1918 was 39.\n\nAside from that, \u201cwe\u2019ve never really seen anything like this,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s 10 leading causes of death, only the cancer death rate fell in 2017. Meanwhile, there were increases in seven others: suicide, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, flu/pneumonia, chronic lower respiratory diseases and unintentional injuries.\n\nAn underlying factor is that the death rate for heart disease, the nation\u2019s No. 1 killer, has stopped falling. In years past, declines in heart disease deaths were enough to offset increases in some other kinds of death, but no longer, Anderson said.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s numbers do sometimes change. This week, CDC officials said they had revised their life expectancy estimate for 2016 after some additional data came in.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this?\n\nCDC officials did not speculate about what\u2019s behind declining life expectancy, but Dr. William Dietz, a disease prevention expert at George Washington University, sees a sense of hopelessness.\n\nFinancial struggles, a widening income gap and divisive politics are all casting a pall over many Americans, he suggested.\n\n\u201cI really do believe that people are increasingly hopeless, and that that leads to drug use, it leads potentially to suicide,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nDrug overdose deaths also continued to climb, surpassing 70,000 last year, in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. The death rate rose 10 percent from the previous year, smaller than the 21 percent jump seen between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite a cause for celebration, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s starting to slow down, but it hasn\u2019t turned around yet,\u2019\u2019 Rowe said. \u201cI think it will take several years.\u201d\n\nAccidental drug overdoses account for more than a third of the unintentional injury deaths, and intentional drug overdoses account for about a tenth of the suicides, said Dr. Holly Hedegaard, a CDC injury epidemiologist.\n\nOther findings\n\nThe CDC figures are based mainly on a review of 2017 death certificates.

Mainstream scientists have condemned the experiment, and universities and government groups are investigating.\n\nThe second pregnancy is in a very early stage and needs more time to be monitored to see if it will last, He said.\n\nLeading scientists said there are now even more reasons to worry, and more questions than answers, after He\u2019s talk. The leader of the conference called the experiment \u201cirresponsible\u201d and evidence that the scientific community had failed to regulate itself to prevent premature efforts to alter DNA.\n\nAltering DNA before or at the time of conception is highly controversial because the changes can be inherited and might harm other genes. It\u2019s banned in some countries including the United States except for lab research.\n\nHe defended his choice of HIV, rather than a fatal inherited disease, as a test case for gene editing, and insisted the girls could benefit from it.\n\n\u201cThey need this protection since a vaccine is not available,\u201d He said.\n\nScientists weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cThis is a truly unacceptable development,\u201d said Jennifer Doudna, a University of California-Berkeley scientist and one of the inventors of the CRISPR gene-editing tool that He said he used. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that he appeared today, but I don\u2019t think that we heard answers. We still need to understand the motivation for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel more disturbed now,\u201d said David Liu of Harvard and MIT\u2019s Broad Institute, and inventor of a variation of the gene-editing tool. \u201cIt\u2019s an appalling example of what not to do about a promising technology that has great potential to benefit society. I hope it never happens again.\u201d\n\nThere is no independent confirmation of He\u2019s claim and he has not yet published in any scientific journal where it would be vetted by experts. At the conference, He failed or refused to answer many questions including who paid for his work, how he ensured that participants understood potential risks and benefits, and why he kept his work secret until after it was done.\n\nAfter He spoke, David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate from the California Institute of Technology and a leader of the conference, said He\u2019s work \u201cwould still be considered irresponsible\u201d because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think that it was medically necessary. The choice of the diseases that we heard discussions about earlier today are much more pressing\u201d than trying to prevent HIV infection this way, he said.\n\nIf gene editing is ever allowed, many scientists have said it should be reserved to treat and prevent serious inherited disorders with no good alternatives, such as sickle cell anemia and Huntington\u2019s disease. HIV is not an appropriate candidate because there are already safe ways to prevent transmission, and if contracted it can be kept under control with medications, researchers said.\n\nThe case shows \u201cthere has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community\u201d and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field, Baltimore said.\n\nBefore He\u2019s talk, Dr. George Daley, Harvard Medical School\u2019s dean and one of the conference organizers, warned against a backlash to gene editing because of He\u2019s experiment. Just because the first case may have been a misstep \u201cshould in no way, I think, lead us to stick our heads in the sand and not consider the very, very positive aspects that could come forth by a more responsible pathway,\u201d Daley said.\n\n\u201cScientists who go rogue ... it carries a deep, deep cost to the scientific community,\u201d Daley said.\n\nRegulators have been swift to condemn the experiment as unethical and unscientific.\n\nThe National Health Commission has ordered local officials in Guangdong province to investigate He\u2019s actions, and his employer, Southern University of Science and Technology of China, is investigating as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, Qui Renzong of the Chinese Academy of Social Science criticized the decision to let He speak at the conference, saying the claim \u201cshould not be on our agenda\u201d until it has been reviewed by independent experts. Whether He violated reproductive medicine laws in China has been unclear; Qui contends that it did, but said, \u201cthe problem is, there\u2019s no penalty.\u201d\n\nHe called on the United Nations to convene a meeting to discuss heritable gene editing to promote international agreement on when it might be OK.\n\nMeanwhile, more American scientists said they had contact with He and were aware of or suspected what he was doing.\n\nDr. Matthew Porteus, a genetics researcher at Stanford University, where He did postdoctoral research, said He told him in February that he intended to try human gene editing. Porteus said he discouraged He and told him \u201cthat it was irresponsible, that he could risk the entire field of gene editing by doing this in a cavalier fashion.\u201d\n\nDr. William Hurlbut, a Stanford ethicist, said he has \u201cspent many hours\u201d talking with He over the last two years about situations where gene editing might be appropriate.\n\n\u201cI knew his early work.

The FAO and International Food Policy Research Institute released the report at the outset of a global conference aimed at speeding up efforts to achieve zero hunger around the world.\n\n\n\n\"The call for action is very clear. It is possible in our lifetime and it is also realistic to end hunger and malnutrition,\" Inonge Wina, vice president of Zambia, told the gathering.\n\n\n\nFood security remains tenuous for many millions of people who lack access to affordable, adequately nourishing diets for a variety of reasons, the most common being poverty.\n\n\n\nBut it's also endangered by civil strife and other conflicts.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Porsche Shows off New Edition of Mainstay 911 Sports Car", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/porsche-shows-off-new-edition-of-mainstay-911-sports-car/4678158.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Porsche says its future is in electric cars but for now it is rolling out a more powerful version of its internal combustion mainstay, the sleek 911 sports car.\n\nStuttgart-based Porsche, part of Volkswagen, is to show off the eighth version of its brand-defining model at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\n\n\nThe new 911 doesn't look much different than earlier editions of the car.

Once used primarily against individuals, ransomware has been increasingly employed in cyberattacks on businesses.\n\nFaramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, are accused of creating the SamSam Ransomware in December 2015 and installing it on the computer networks of more than 230 public and private entities in the United States and Canada, according to a 26-page indictment unsealed Wednesday.\n\nWith the targeted computer users unable to access their data, Savandi and Mansouri, operating out of Iran, would then demand a ransom payment made in the form of the virtual currency bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for the encrypted data.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the two Iranians received more than $6 million in cryptocurrencies from their victims which they converted into Iranian currency, or rial, using Iran-based bitcoin exchanges. About half of the infiltrated entities refused to make a ransom payment and suffered over $30 million in lost data, according to the indictment.\n\nThe victims included the cities of Atlanta, Newark and San Diego, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the University of Calgary in Calgary, Canada, and six U.S. public health care-related entities.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the six-count indictment at a press conference in Washington.\n\n\"Every sector of our economy is a target of malicious cyberactivity,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the events described in this indictment highlight the urgent need for municipalities, public utilities, health care institutions, universities, and other public organizations to enhance their cybersecurity.\"\n\nThe two indicted Iranians remain at large and have been placed on the FBI's wanted list. They're charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, among other related crimes.\n\nThe indictment marks the first time the Justice Department has brought charges against cybercriminals involved in a ransomware and extortion scheme, according to Rosenstein.\n\nRansomware has grown in sophistication and distribution in recent years. According to a report by the cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, ransomware payments were expected to reach a record $2 billion in 2017.\n\n'Trend' from Iran\n\nThe charges are also the latest in a string of indictments brought against Iranian hackers and cybercriminals in recent months. In March, prosecutors charged nine Iranian hackers with penetrating the computer networks of hundreds of American and foreign universities and other institutions to steal valuable research material. Unlike some of the previously indicted Iranian hackers, however, Savandi and Mansouri are not believed to have ties to Tehran.\n\n\"The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cybercriminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities,\" said Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI. \"As cyberthreats evolve and cybercriminals develop more sophisticated techniques, so do we.\"\n\nThe 35-month computer hacking scheme led by Savandi and Mansouri began in January 2016 with an attack on an unidentified business in Mercer County, New Jersey, and moved on to public entities such as the City of Newark and health care providers such as Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said the Iranian hackers carefully chose their targets. A few days prior to attacking the network of Kansas Heart Hospital, for example, they \"conducted online searches concerning the hospital and accessed its website,\" he said.\n\nKimberly Goody, manager of cybercrime analysis at cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the hackers probably chose to target health care and government organizations because \"they provide critical services and believed their likelihood of paying was higher as a result.\"\n\nThe indictment does not name the entities that paid a ransom."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Seoul\u2019s Telecom Outage Highlights Need for Redundancy in Connected World", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-telecom-fire/4677704.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Residents in Seoul discovered how fragile their telecommunications system was this past weekend when a fire disrupted service for millions. The government and the provider vowed to implement changes to avoid a repeat of the event, but the system failure demonstrated a need for greater redundancy and preparation for future natural and technological disasters.\n\nThe fire affected customers of KT, the nation\u2019s second largest telecommunications company. They found themselves unable to make calls, access the internet, complete ATM or credit card transactions, and watch television. Local media also reported an elderly woman died when she fell ill and her husband wasn\u2019t able to reach emergency services during the service outage.\n\nLee Manjong, chairman of the Korean Association for Terrorism Studies and professor of the department of Law & Police at Howon University, told VOA that while it is nearly impossible to prevent widespread system outages, certain steps can be taken to avoid catastrophic failures.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to split the public safety net (fire, medical, and police emergency services) and make system backups (redundancies) compulsory,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the blaze, South Korea\u2019s minister of Science and ICT (Information, Communications, and Technology), You Young-min, spoke to the CEOs of South Korea\u2019s three major communication companies (SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+) to discuss their backup plans.\n\nYou said the companies \u201cneed to swiftly change their contract clauses on compensation issues and also need to come up with plans that would reroute traffic if such accidents, which shouldn\u2019t happen again, happen.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what steps the government planned on taking to prevent a similar event in the future, the ministry declined to offer specifics, stating that responsible parties would prepare fire prevention measures this year and set up a task force to implement recommendations.\n\nLocal broadcaster MBC also reported that telecommunication companies and the government held a 20-minute virtual natural disaster drill in May to simulate a system outage, but the simulation proved to be ineffective in real-world situations.\n\nInterconnected services\n\nThe Seoul fire and resulting system outage demonstrated how interconnected services are in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIf a network is down, then it affects other networks such as finance, power, energy, and railway,\u201d said Lee.\n\nHe said there are multiple ways the electronic infrastructure can be paralyzed. This includes physical damage, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. However, Lee notes disruptions caused by cyber incursions are more effective.\n\n\u201cCyber attacks are more efficient as they can take place without access to the physical location of the target,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lee, this is because the government is able to secure physical sites, so cyber-warriors choose \u201csoft targets\u201d connected through the Internet.\n\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attack could be launched from the Internet and attack telecommunication networks. This type of attack floods a computer network with incoming data packets and overwhelms the system, effectively shutting it down. Lee said such attacks on telecom systems could wreak havoc and paralyze communication.\n\nHe cautioned that a successful cyber attack on South Korea\u2019s technological infrastructure could yield \u201cunimaginable\u201d damage because of the country\u2019s reliance on networked services.\n\nFire and recovery\n\nSaturday\u2019s fire struck an underground facility of KT, destroying telephone lines and fiber optic cables, taking about 10 hours to suppress.\n\nSeoul authorities rate facilities on a scale from A to D. Buildings rated A, B, or C must have adequate fire prevention systems installed, while those receiving a D rating do not.\n\nKT\u2019s Ahyeon facility, where the fire took place, was one of 27 D-rated facilities belonging to the company. As such, fire scene investigators found there were no fire detectors or sprinkler system installed at the Ahyeon facility and only a single fire extinguisher present.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s other telecommunication carriers utilize over 800 similar facilities throughout the country, none of which are required to have fire detection equipment or sprinklers installed.\n\nLee said government regulations must be altered to bridge the gaps to ensure that such facilities are required to have redundant services elsewhere in the event of a natural disaster or cyber attack.\n\nEstimates are the blaze resulted in about $7 million in property damage. KT has announced it would compensate affected customers by awarding them a free month of service for their inconvenience. KB security expects that amount to total about $27.5 million.\n\nIn a text message to customers, KT said it was \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience. We will adopt preventive measures such as safety inspections\u2026 to avoid a recurrence.\u201d\n\nSeoul officials told VOA the cause of the fire remains unknown and the investigation to determine its source could last a month.\n\nLee Ju-hyun contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "In San Francisco, This Robot Barista Knows the Way You Like Your Latte", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4677598.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "There are plenty of places to get a cup of coffee in San Francisco.

This meant that the Tamrazyans would be able to take shelter in the church.\n\nThe continuous worship service started on Oct. 26 at 1:30 p.m. \u2015 and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.\n\n\u201cThe family is in the building continuously. They can be arrested when they go outside,\u201d the Rev. Theo Hettema, a spokesperson for the Protestant Church The Hague\u2019s asylum efforts told HuffPost in an email.\n\n\u201cHoe ziet dat er eigenlijk uit, als mensen nu al bijna 80uur lang aan het bidden en aan het zingen zijn, om een Armeens gezin voor uitzetting te beschermen?\u201d\n\nNou, zo dus:#KerkasielBethel pic.twitter.com/FGVBi7Touy \u2014 Axel Wicke (@elziax) October 29, 2018\n\nHettema said the Tamrazyans feared going back to Armenia because the father of the family, Sasun, had been threatened for his political activism. The family learned in September that the government was planning to deport them. The Tamrazyans reportedly took shelter in a church in Katwijk. When that living arrangement became tenuous, the Protestant Church The Hague agreed to take over and help the family move to Bethel. As a result, the Tamrazyans now have the backing of Netherlands\u2019 largest Protestant denomination.\n\nBethel has a rotating array of about 400 ministers and lay people coming to help conduct the services. They\u2019ve also invited supporters in the community to attend services and help with groceries. The church says about 3,500 visitors from all over the Netherlands have come to Bethel to help support the Tamrazyans.\n\nAttendees of the church\u2019s services range from two people in the middle of the night to about 100 on Sunday mornings, Hettema said. The Tamrazyans attend the church service or stay in a private room in the church building.\n\nIn a press release, church leaders said it respects court orders but finds itself in a \u201cdilemma\u201d \u2015 \u201cthe choice between respecting the government and protecting the rights of a child.\u201d\n\nLeaders said they wanted to engage in a dialogue with politicians about the family\u2019s asylum request and about the Netherlands\u2019 treatment of child asylum-seekers looking to get residence permits.\n\nAdvocacy groups claim there are at least 400 other cases of child asylum-seekers who have been living in the Netherlands for over five years, the BBC reports.\n\nHettema said this phenomenon of churches opening their doors to protect refugees is not at all uncommon in the Netherlands \u2015 he claims it\u2019s happened at least 52 times. But in the past, he said, a continuous church service wasn\u2019t required to prevent police entry \u2015 which has made the Tamrazyans\u2019 case \u201cmuch harder.\u201d\n\nStill, Hettema said the church plans to continue offering the family sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWe plan to continue the services as long as our aim, to create time and space for a dialogue on the life of this family and the fate of children in similar circumstances is supported,\u201d Hettema said. \u201cAt the moment, we do not know how long the church service will take.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe act [out] of compassion and from a motivation to live like responsible civilians of our state, who care for others and remind the government to their responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, worship at the church continues.\n\nVanavond in het #kerkasielBethel (met mijn verkouden basstem als extra bonus): pic.twitter.com/x45CGxxAxC \u2014 Axel Wicke (@elziax) November 26, 2018"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Hundreds Protest In Tunisia Against Saudi Crown Prince's Visit", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-tunisia-mohammed-bin-salman_us_5bfd6752e4b03b230fa73fac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of Tunisians protested on Tuesday against a visit by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince, denouncing the top Saudi royal as a murderer in the second straight day of demonstrations condemning the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir to the throne of the world\u2019s top oil exporter, departed from Cairo on Tuesday and was expected in Tunis in the late afternoon on a tour of Arab states that has also taken him to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince, at Riyadh\u2019s consulate in Istanbul six weeks ago has strained Saudi Arabia\u2019s ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed\u2019s image abroad.\n\nSaudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) that demands the policy be ended within 30 days. Thirty-seven senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), voted the other way, to preserve without debate the status quo of American intelligence, logistical and diplomatic assistance for the Saudi campaign.\n\nThe 63-37 vote represented a huge win for lawmakers and outside groups who had been trying to build support for the anti-war effort since the last time a measure was brought up in March. That resolution failed by a vote of 55-44.\n\nMoreover, intense efforts by the Trump administration to defend the policy \u2015 including a closed-door briefing with senators earlier in the day by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2015 backfired, as powerful GOP senators like Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally, expressed frustration with top officials.\n\n\u201cI changed my mind because I\u2019m pissed,\u201d Graham, who had previously opposed the measure, told reporters after the vote. \u201cThe way the administration has handled Saudi has been unacceptable. The briefing didn\u2019t help me today at all.\u201d\n\nOther senators similarly complained about the failure of CIA director Gina Haspel to appear at the briefing to discuss U.S. intelligence about Saudi authorities\u2019 roles in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe Senate will now debate the measure on the floor within the next few weeks, and it is likely to face numerous amendments that could water it down. Even if it is ultimately passed, it will not compel an end to the U.S. support for the effort by the Saudis and their partner the United Arab Emirates.\n\nStill, Wednesday\u2019s vote was a landmark moment for the increasingly tense debates over who controls matters of war and peace for the U.S. and what to do about the decades-old U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nThe way the administration has handled Saudi has been unacceptable.

It\u2019s not just the mere formality of going through the motions of declaring a war, it\u2019s about when you don\u2019t go through that process, the American people never get brought in to the discussion about whether or not to sacrifice in American blood.\u201d\n\nThe Utah conservative said he saw the vote as more a victory for the separation of powers, particularly the role of Congress in declaring war, than a hit against President Donald Trump, noting that it was President Barack Obama who initially approved the Yemen policy. His comment reflected how multiple factors drove this coalition of senators together: Some saw this primarily as a constitutional issue, others chiefly a humanitarian one, and for most, it appeared that the combination, added to frustration over the Khashoggi killing, made the vote inevitable.\n\nOutside groups who have been major players in the Capitol Hill fight over what\u2019s become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster applauded the senators\u2019 stand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Kate Kizer of the peace group Win Without War wrote on Twitter.

Opponents like Cotton are likely to drag out the process on the floor as much as possible \u2015 which could eat up a week or more.\n\nProponents of the effort, however, fear that if the Senate doesn\u2019t take up the bill in the lame-duck Congress, its chances of passage next year may be substantially harder with Democrats in control of the House. Newly elected Democratic members in the House may add more liberal provisions that could bog down the bill in the Senate, for example.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen this year, it\u2019s probably never going to happen,\u201d Graham told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), another supporter of the bill, estimated on Tuesday that 21 Republicans are firmly on board with the measure. Another five GOP senators, he said, are \u201csoft\u201d yeses. The bill has 11 Democratic co-sponsors.\n\nFederal inmates accounted for fewer than 200,000 of the more than two million Americans locked up in prisons and jails in 2016, according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The federal prison population skyrocketed from just 25,000 in the early 1980s thanks to new mandatory minimum sentences and the elimination of parole. In recent years the number of inmates has gradually declined.\n\nOne of the most notorious mandatory minimums of the 1980s established a five-year sentence for offenses involving 500 grams of cocaine or just 5 grams of crack cocaine \u2015 meaning the penalty for crack was 100 times harsher than the penalty for regular powder cocaine, even though crack is nowhere near 100 times more harmful. The harsher penalty overwhelmingly fell on African-Americans, who comprise 38 percent of federal prisoners but only 13 percent of the overall U.S. population.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Cotton is doing everything he can to sour Republicans on the legislation.\n\nCongress passed a law in 2010 that reduced penalties for crack offenses. Instead of being 100 times harsher than the sentences for regular cocaine crimes, the compromise law made the penalties only 18 times harsher. But lawmakers elected not to make the change retroactive. As a result, more than 2,000 federal crack offenders remain in prison today even though they\u2019d be free if they\u2019d been sentenced under current law.\n\nThe First Step Act would give such offenders a chance to petition the courts for a review of their case, which Tom Cotton thinks is awful.\n\n\u201cThere was long, careful debate about those provisions. Retroactivity was one specific part of that debate,\u2033 Cotton said. \u201cThat was the compromise that was struck in 2010. I think it\u2019s a reasonable compromise.\u201d\n\nThe version of the bill that passed the House earlier this year, by a vote of 360 to 59, did not include the retroactive crack provision. The lack of sentencing reform was one of the reasons that more than 100 liberal policy groups signed a letter of opposition by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The core of the legislation is a \u201crisk and needs assessment program\u201d that critics say would give the government too much leeway to decide which prisoners are at the lowest risk of committing crimes in the future if they are released early.\n\nThe latest Senate version of the bill, which Grassley and several Democrats released last week, added the crack provision and three other reforms to mandatory minimums that wouldn\u2019t apply retroactively. The Leadership Conference hasn\u2019t signaled support or opposition to the new bill, but the changes did win over the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cIt is the thing that tipped us over the scale to support this,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s Jesselyn McCurdy said.\n\nCotton helped spoil criminal justice reform legislation in 2016 and has an extraordinary willingness to make a stink over things he doesn\u2019t like. In 2015 he wrote an unusual \u201cOpen Letter to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d warning them that a future president and Congress could abdicate a nuclear agreement the Barack Obama administration and other countries had struck with Iran. That same year, he blocked an ambassador nomination simply to spite the former president (something he later said he somewhat regretted).

Now he's on track to be a lifetime federal judge.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 The Senate on Wednesday inched closer to confirming Thomas Farr to be a lifetime federal judge, despite strong opposition from civil rights groups and Democrats over his long career of trying to weaken black voters\u2019 rights.\n\nThe Senate voted 50-50 on a procedural step to advance Farr\u2019s nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Vice President Mike Pence came in to break the tie. Every Democrat voted against Farr, as did Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is opposing all of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees until he gets a vote on a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nFarr\u2019s final confirmation vote is expected later this week.\n\nCivil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus have been trying to sink Farr\u2019s nomination for nearly a year. The 64-year-old attorney wrote North Carolina\u2019s extreme voter ID law in 2013, which was later struck down by a federal appeals court. The court found the law targeted black people \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d Farr also defended the state\u2019s racially discriminatory gerrymandering in federal court in 2015 (and lost), and he may have lied to the Senate about his role in disenfranchising tens of thousands of black voters when he worked for the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in 1990.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that the Senate would even consider someone with Thomas Farr\u2019s record,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said Tuesday. \u201cIn 2018, this should simply be unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt would only have taken one more Republican voting with Democrats to stop Farr\u2019s nomination. Democrats had been eyeing Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), a moderate who sometimes sides with them, and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the lone black senator in his party, as potential allies. But despite a dramatic delayed vote by Scott, both voted to advance Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nBut Scott said he remained undecided on whether to ultimately support Farr\u2019s confirmation. He explained he had more questions about the nominee\u2019s work as a lawyer on Helms\u2019 campaign and his role in an effort to discourage black people from voting.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the Senate long enough to see a whole bunch of questionable nominees, frankly from both parties, but Thomas Farr is unquestionably one of the worst. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)\n\nAhead of the vote, Democrats took turns ripping Farr as unfit for the federal bench.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate long enough to see a whole bunch of questionable nominees, frankly from both parties, but Thomas Farr is unquestionably one of the worst,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe President Trump nominated him; it\u2019s even harder to believe Senate Republicans are considering him again. This is a man who stands for disenfranchisement of voters, particularly minority voters.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis and Richard Burr of North Carolina, who are ushering Farr\u2019s nomination through the Senate, have dismissed Democrats\u2019 concerns about Farr and noted that he was rated \u201cwell-qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically downsized Kavanaugh tactics, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Tillis told Roll Call on Tuesday, suggesting Democrats are unfairly attacking Farr in the same way he thinks they unfairly attacked Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation process this summer.\n\nIn a development late Tuesday, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law cited new revelations in a 1991 memorandum from the U.S. Justice Department showing that Farr played a central role in voter suppression schemes targeting black voters as far back as 1984.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department described Farr as the \u2018primary coordinator\u2019 of these schemes,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, the group\u2019s president and executive director. \u201cMoving forward with this nomination in light of this new evidence would make a mockery of the Senate\u2019s advice and consent obligation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much that detail could affect Farr\u2019s confirmation. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Farr is on track to be confirmed no later than Thursday night.\n\nIgor Bobic contributed reporting."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Many Americans Are Giving Trump The Benefit Of The Doubt On Manufacturing Jobs", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-manufacturing-jobs-gm-layoffs-poll_us_5bff257ce4b0864f4f69f6b8", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Forty-four percent of Americans believe either that President Donald Trump has brought manufacturing jobs back to the country or that he\u2019s likely to do so, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll taken after a spate of General Motors layoffs. That\u2019s roughly similar to the 49 percent who said this last April and nearly identical to the 45 percent who said the same in November of last year.\n\nThe optimistic group is divided roughly in half on what the president has accomplished so far: about 22 percent of Americans say that Trump has already succeeded in bringing manufacturing jobs back and about 23 percent say that he\u2019s likely to do so in the future. Some 36 percent of Americans think the president is unlikely to fulfill that promise.\n\nThose people who believe Trump has already kept his promise to bring back blue-collar jobs are among his staunchest backers: 71 percent strongly approve of his job performance. The ones still waiting for Trump to revitalize the manufacturing industry are also supporters, but less enthusiastic ones: About 80 percent approve of his job performance, but just 39 percent say they approve strongly. The people who think it\u2019s unlikely the jobs will return under Trump\u2019s watch are, overwhelmingly, critics of his presidency as a whole.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2016 and in rallies since taking office, Trump has pledged to restore those jobs.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you folks in Ohio and in this area, don\u2019t sell your house,\u201d the president told supporters in Youngstown in July 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get those jobs coming back, and we\u2019re going to fill up those factories or rip them down and build brand-new ones. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d This week, GM announced that its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, was among the locations the company plans to shutter as it cuts up to 14,000 jobs in North America.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Americans consider those GM job cuts to be at least a somewhat serious problem for the U.S., although only 31 percent call it \u201cvery serious.\u201d Americans say by an 11-point margin that the cuts weren\u2019t inevitable \u2015 39 percent say the job losses could have been prevented by better government policies and 28 percent say they couldn\u2019t, with the rest unsure. But they\u2019re split on how much responsibility, if any, Trump bears for the layoffs. While 38 percent say he shares at least some responsibility, 40 percent believe he deserves little or none of the blame.\n\nTrump has long earned his best ratings for his handling of the economy, the strength of which has quite possibly kept his overall job rating from sinking lower than it stands.\n\nHe is not, however, broadly seen as a champion of the average American. Half the public says that Trump\u2019s economic policies favor the rich, compared to just 9 percent who believe he favors the middle class or the poor, and a quarter who think he treats all the groups equally. And while 36 percent believe the president is working for the interests of people like them when he makes decisions, half say he\u2019s either working against them or not considering them at all.\n\nBut so far at least, the president\u2019s ratings on those metrics have remained remarkably stable. In six HuffPost/YouGov polls taken starting in April 2017, the percentage of Americans who think Trump has their interests in mind has stayed between 31 and 38 percent. And after a pre-inauguration poll in which 44 percent thought Trump would favor the wealthy, five subsequent surveys dating back to August 2017 have all found that number hovering around or just over the 50 percent mark.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 26-28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The operation was instead an isolated move against specific kratom retailers that were breaking state law, they said. They also claimed that other sellers could avoid similar trouble by implementing business practices that would bring them into compliance \u2015 at least in the agency\u2019s eyes.\n\nKratom is derived from the dried leaves of a Southeast Asian tree in the coffee family. Often sold as a powder that can be packed into pills or capsules or brewed into tea, kratom has gained popularity in recent years, with many vendors marketing it as an herbal supplement. Supporters say kratom can help with opioid withdrawal, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and other conditions.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal and state agencies have maintained that kratom has no approved medical use. Opponents of kratom have narrowed in on the fact that the plant\u2019s most prominent active compounds exhibit opioid-like properties, which they say proves it is an addictive and even potentially deadly drug \u2015 and must be banned.\n\nIn October, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy became the latest to join the campaign against kratom when it voted in favor of classifying the botanical as a Schedule I controlled substance, alongside drugs like heroin and synthetic opioids. Although kratom remains legal in Ohio for now, that\u2019s not how it seemed last Wednesday, when police showed up at the Life of Kratom store in Worthington.\n\n\u201cThey had like 10 police officers, the chief of police, it was crazy,\u201d owner Jack Smith told HuffPost.\n\nYanawut via Getty Images Kratom powder is derived from the leaves of a Southeast Asian tree in the coffee family. At least 11 kratom stores in central Ohio were raided by law enforcement last week. Authorities say it was an isolated operation.\n\nThe officers didn\u2019t confiscate anything, but they did lock down Smith\u2019s inventory after accusing him of selling an \u201cunapproved\u201d substance, he said. At least 10 more stores across central Ohio received similar visits, the Ohio Department of Agriculture told HuffPost.\n\nKratom consumers and vendors were quick to see the move as a sign that prohibition had all but officially begun in Ohio. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case.\n\nAll of the kratom businesses hit last week were found to be in violation of state law, said Mark Bruce, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which supervised the raids. In Ohio, any product that does not have a \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d approval from the FDA can\u2019t be sold or marketed for human consumption in a food or drug, Bruce explained.\n\n\u201cIf a business is selling kratom and their packaging or website or marketing materials associated with it indicate or infer that it\u2019s to be ingested by humans, we consider that to be an adulterated product,\u201d he said.\n\nSelling kratom in a pill or capsule form or in an edible such as a brownie or candy \u2015 all of which are clearly designed for people to consume \u2015 would therefore not be acceptable. It can be sold as a powder.\n\nState law also prohibits retailers from making unproved claims about the medical benefits of products like kratom, said Terri Gerhardt, chief of Ohio\u2019s Division of Food Safety. Sellers can\u2019t tell customers that kratom is a treatment for opioid addiction or a natural painkiller, for example.\n\nAn investigation revealed that all of the targeted stores were breaking some or all of those rules, said Gerhardt, adding that the probe had stemmed from a complaint by a local health department regarding practices at a handful of the shops.\n\n\u201cWe have a statutory responsibility to look into complaints when they come to our attention,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Gerhardt insisted that just because these kratom vendors had run afoul of the law didn\u2019t mean they were being shut down for good. In fact, she said, retailers could still sell kratom so long as they adjusted their packaging, marketing materials and product offerings to make sure there is no implication that the kratom they carry is actually meant to be consumed.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t stopping them from selling it. We\u2019re stopping them from selling and advertising it as a food,\u201d said Gerhardt. \u201cI like to tell people you can sell eye of newt and tail of dragon, you just can\u2019t tell anybody what they can do with it.\u201d\n\nThese tweaks might include appending labels to products simply identifying them as \u201ckratom,\u201d without any additional instructions about how it should be used. Or vendors could add labels explicitly stating that their kratom products are \u201cnot for human consumption.\u201d Sellers have turned to this loophole in other cities and jurisdictions around the country, with some using the deceptive labeling to sell synthetic cannabinoids or novel psychoactive substances.\n\nWe can\u2019t speak for what the FDA would do. Mark Bruce, Ohio Department of Agriculture\n\nThis approach may satisfy the powers that be in Ohio, but it\u2019s unclear how much protection, if any, it might provide against regulators at the FDA, which has taken a much more aggressive stance against kratom.\n\n\u201cIf the product is labeled as \u2018Not for Human Consumption\u2019 [the Ohio Department of Agriculture] would not take action \u2015 but we can\u2019t speak for what the FDA would do,\u201d said Bruce, the Department of Agriculture spokesman.\n\nAdvocates for the natural supplement industry have warned retailers that deliberately mislabeling products can open them up to prosecution.\n\nThe new procedures are far from a perfect solution, a representative of the American Kratom Association, the nation\u2019s largest kratom advocacy group, told HuffPost. The AKA said it has been in touch with the state agriculture agency in hopes of finding a compromise that could give vendors additional leeway to sell a wider range of products, without having to resort to potentially fraudulent tactics.\n\nFor the time being, however, kratom stores in Ohio appear to be doing what they can to comply with the advisory that state authorities have given them.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Life of Kratom was back up and running. The only thing Smith is selling now is raw kratom powder, he said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'I'm Afraid To Google My Own Name': What It's Really Like To Be Body-Positive On Instagram", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/body-positive-instagram_us_5be9a40fe4b0caeec2bbd8ef", "accessed_time": "2018-11-29 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "The internet can play wildly contradictory roles in the body-positive movement. On one hand, social media has allowed demand for inclusivity to spread quickly and broadly \u2015 increasingly, the people in media and on runways more closely reflect what consumers and audiences actually look like. It has never been easier to find and follow people on social media who advocate for self-love and inspire their audiences to do the same.\n\nBut the internet can also be, to put it mildly, a hellscape. Those who have made a career of being open and vulnerable with their followers about issues of body image and activism are no doubt familiar with the vitriol and bad behavior that come from trolls.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what being on the receiving end of that kind of hate \u2015 and that kind of love! \u2015 might feel like to a person who promotes inclusion and advocates for self-love. So we reached out to those very people to find out.\n\nBelow, eight women who blog, model, write, advocate and are making a difference in their communities and beyond talk about what putting themselves out there on the web really looks and feels like \u2015 the good, the bad and the downright outrageous.\n\nLaura Delarato, sex educator, writer and creator of The Comments Project\n\n\u201cI do have to take breaks from social media \u2014 my DMs get way too filled with trolls telling me that I\u2019m destroying women, promoting obesity, and that I should kill myself all because I don\u2019t hate my body. That hurts, and it feels very isolating in the heat of someone else\u2019s visceral anger. When that happens, I find ways to use it to promote my art and my experience; taking breaks from posting when I can. But [commenters] never stop me from living the life that I want and being the person I desperately needed to see as an insecure, bulimic teen. They make a case for me to do more, work more, be more.\n\nFor every hate message I get, I\u2019m flooded with kind words and beautiful messages from women who are inspired by what I post and my story. That, to me, is worth more than any troll with a grudge. I will always stand by my decision to be super open and forthcoming on my social media. It allowed me to be the person I needed to see when I was younger and, in turn, make other women feel comfortable exploring their body, their emotions, their sexuality, their trauma. And that is the biggest pay off of it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a hard time with online bullies since middle school, and it\u2019s never actually gotten better. Now that I\u2019m older, with a platform to openly be a bigger model, it\u2019s a lot easier for strangers to bully, humiliate and harass me. I\u2019m afraid to Google my own name because of websites dedicated to hating people who look like me, made by fat-phobic and racist people.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve broken down so many times from seeing so much hate spread about me. There were many times when I thought leaving online would make everything better, but it won\u2019t. The career I am fighting for requires me to be active both on and offline. I feel alone and defeated a lot, but I keep pushing because I know how important what I am doing is for people who are still battling loving themselves and gives them hope in the modeling and fashion world. There will be people who do not like you for God knows whatever reason but you can\u2019t let strangers be the reason you give up. You can\u2019t let anyone or anything be a reason why you give up.\u201d\n\nJane Belfry, founder and creative director of The Thicc\n\n\u201cBeing a woman on the internet is terrible in general. For my own sanity, I chose to make my personal Instagram and Twitter private after launching The Thicc so that the brand lives on its own and is more about a collective conversation about destigmatizing our bodies, experiences, mental health and beauty, and not just my own personal experiences with those things.\n\nThough I feel that my own vulnerability has inspired others to contribute, whether it\u2019s writing or posing for me in front of the camera. We get dozens of messages a week from people saying that the content is helping them feel beautiful and seen, or helping their eating disorder recovery, or the content they wish they\u2019d seen when they were younger. Those are the positives, that\u2019s why I created it. We don\u2019t have a lot of trolls at this point, but I did and do get quite a few comments on my personal account, most popularly: \u2018You\u2019re not \u201cThicc\u201d you\u2019re fat,\u2019 which... OK? These comments used to be incredibly jarring, now I scroll through the weirdo DMs and say, in the words of Ariana Grande, \u2018Thank u, next.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve learned throughout my body-positive journey is that hurt people hurt people. Those negative comments come from people who are miserable; they hate themselves and they cannot stand to see someone, especially someone who\u2019s loving themselves despite antiquated societal norms, so they lash out.\n\nPeople who are happy and love themselves have no desire to hurt others, so any negative message or comment I get just alerts me to how sad and miserable that commenter is. But they\u2019ll never get me to engage in their sad behavior; I just delete, block and move on. I can typically tell if it\u2019s going to be something hateful from the first couple of words. I don\u2019t even bother reading their entire comment \u2015 not worth my time! At the end of the day, I don\u2019t care if there are people who don\u2019t like what I do or how I look or even the sheer fact that I\u2019m satisfied with myself. I may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I don\u2019t want everyone to drink me anyway \u2015 it would leave me drained.\u201d\n\nSarah Chiwaya, editor and blogger at Curvily Fashion\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a shy person, but there is definitely something substantively different about putting yourself out there online. I started my blog because seeing other stylish, confident, happy plus-size women had such an immense impact on my own self-confidence, and I once I realized just how much representation matters, I wanted to be a part of that.\n\nUnfortunately, many people feel way too free to be a dick online, especially if anyone is bucking deeply entrenched biases or outdated norms. As a plus blogger who focuses on body positivity, I get this all too often. A lot of the trolling is from furious feminist-hating dudes who love to simultaneously insult and objectify women who don\u2019t fit their idea of a perfect female body. For the most part, I can just delete and block these types of disgusting comments and move on, but occasionally it piles up and can just feel like too much.\n\nAnother variety of negative comment I tend to get is from other plus women who have so completely internalized their fat-phobia that they feel like they need to be enforcers of it. These comments often go something like, \u2018As a plus-size woman, I know what is flattering, and I would never wear [stripes/a sleeveless shirt/a bikini/sequins/a crop top/etc., etc., etc.]!!!\u2019 These ones are both annoying and sad, because when I was deep in my own body loathing, I had the same thoughts. My life is much happier and my wardrobe is exponentially better now, so hopefully they can make it to the other side too, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to hold their hand throughout the process if they are exceptionally rude about it.\n\nBut the comments that take the biggest toll on me are actually the ones that aren\u2019t trolling at all, but are outright objectifying and sexualizing me. The comments with the tongue emoji always make me want to hurl. I make it clear that I am posting for people looking for fashion inspiration and representation, and actively block dudes that send creepy DMs and dick pics, but the comments just keep coming. Fortunately, the upside of being able to positively impact people well outweighs the negatives, but I just wish more people would keep in mind that there is a real person who has to read and process the gross and mean things they type. Keep your hatred and objectification to yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you are 100 percent unapologetically yourself, putting yourself out there on the internet can be a struggle. People will always judge and have something nasty to say, but if you know you are being true to yourself, it becomes easier to deal with negativity, as it\u2019s just other people\u2019s insecurity.\n\nOne image I posted of myself in pajamas \u2015 very comfy and happy \u2015 got 800 hateful comments, mostly from male fitness bloggers saying I was a fat pig who should be slaughtered, that I had put them off their dinner with how grotesque I was. I later found out I was put on a blog and targeted. I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t upset at the time, but little did these trolls know their targeted attack caused my Instagram to reach a huge engagement and I went up 10,000 followers from the exposure. Their hate helped me gain new supporters, so who is the real winner now?\u201d\n\nAnastasia Garcia, photographer and advisory board member for Consider The Image\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy exposing yourself to countless people. Especially when it comes to revealing very personal truths about your own body. In the beginning it was really scary. As a photographer, my role is to let my work speak and to remain quiet. For a long time I thought that I couldn\u2019t speak up, because it would discredit my perception as a professional photographer. But the more I spoke up about my experiences, the more positive responses I got. I\u2019ve found that being honest about my experiences and my journey has helped me connect to, and inspire others who have gone through the similar body issues. I thought I was alone, but the honest truth is most women hate their bodies, and that is a symptom of an exclusive fashion, and media industry that doesn\u2019t celebrate a diverse range of women.\n\nSo for the most part, my experience putting myself out there has been a really positive one. I mean, sure, I\u2019ve had my fair share of trolls, and mean people. One of my clients is a plus-size lingerie company, and after a shoot they gifted me some of the lingerie we had shot. I loved the pieces, and felt so sexy wearing them. I ended up posting some photos of myself in lingerie \u2014 and my client reposted on it their Instagram. The very first comment on the image was from a guy who said, \u2018This is not sexy. She is too fat to be wearing this.\u2019\n\nIn most professions people don\u2019t enter the workplace exposed to everyone with a social media account, and most professionals don\u2019t have to worry about their body jeopardizing their work or the sales of their client. Thankfully my client was supportive. They sent me a lovely email and deleted the man\u2019s comment right away. But the fact still remains that man\u2019s comment could have jeopardized my future work with that company. Beyond embarrassing me, he could impacted my professional work.\n\nI also always get a constant flow of \u201cfit girls\u201d reaching out to me asking if I\u2019d like to participate in their weight-loss programs, or expressing \u201cconcern for my health,\u201d or the select few people claiming that my photography promotes obesity and unhealthy lifestyles.

Because reactors require 720 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of electricity they produce, they could be vulnerable to changes in water availability due to climate change.\n\nCall it the nuclear power industry\u2019s thirst trap.\n\nThe United States\u2019 aging fleet of nuclear reactors \u2015 responsible for one-fifth of the country\u2019s electricity and most of its low-carbon power \u2015 has never been more necessary as policymakers scramble to shrink planet-warming emissions. Yet the plants are struggling to stay afloat, with six stations shut down in the last five years and an additional 16 reactors scheduled to close over the next decade. So far, new coal- and gas-burning facilities are replacing them.\n\nThe nuclear industry blames high maintenance costs, competition from cheaper alternatives and hostile regulators concerned about radiation disasters like the 2012 Fukushima meltdown in Japan. But the country\u2019s most water-intensive source of electricity faces what could be an even bigger problem as climate change increases the risk of drought and taxes already crumbling water infrastructure.\n\nThat finding, highlighted in the landmark climate change report that the Trump administration released with apparent reluctance last Friday, illustrates the complex and at times paradoxical realities of anthropogenic, or human-caused, warming. It also stokes an already hot debate over the role nuclear energy should play in fighting global warming, a month after United Nations scientists warned that carbon dioxide emissions must be halved in the next 12 years to avoid cataclysmic climate change leading to at least $54 trillion in damage.\n\nThe report \u2015 the second installment of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated update on the causes and effects of anthropogenic warming from 13 federal agencies \u2015 devoted its entire third chapter to water contamination and depletion. Aging, deteriorating infrastructure means \u201cwater systems face considerable risk even without anticipated future climate changes,\u201d the report states. But warming-linked droughts and drastic changes in seasonal precipitation \u201cwill add to the stress on water supplies and adversely impact water supply.\u201d\n\nNearly every sector of the economy is susceptible to water system changes. And utilities are particularly at risk. In the fourth chapter, the report\u2019s roughly 300 authors conclude, \u201cMost U.S. power plants \u2026 rely on a steady supply of water for cooling, and operations are expected to be affected by changes in water availability and temperature increases.\u201d\n\nFor nuclear plants, that warning is particularly grave. Reactors require 720 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of electricity they produce, according to data from the National Energy Technology Laboratory in West Virginia cited in 2012 by the magazine New Scientist. That compares with the roughly 500 gallons coal requires and 190 gallons natural gas needs to produce the same amount of electricity. Solar plants, by contrast, use approximately 20 gallons per megawatt-hour, mostly for cleaning equipment, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.\n\nNuclear plants are already vulnerable to drought. Federal regulations require plants to shut down if water in the river or lake that feeds its cooling drops below a certain level. By the end of the 2012 North American heat wave, nuclear generation fell to its lowest point in a decade, with plants operating at only 93 percent of capacity.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump said he doesn't believe the National Climate Assessment released Nov. 23.\n\nThe availability of water is one problem, particularly for the majority of U.S. nuclear plants located far from the coasts and dependent on freshwater. Another is the temperature of the water that\u2019s available.\n\nNearly half the nuclear plants in the U.S. use once-through cooling systems, meaning they draw water from a local source, cool their reactors, then discharge the warmed water into another part of the river, lake, aquifer or ocean. Environmental regulations bar plants from releasing used water back into nature above certain temperatures. In recent years, regulators in states like New York and California rejected plant operators\u2019 requests to pull more water from local rivers, essentially mandating the installation of costly closed-loop systems that cool and reuse cooling water.\n\nIn 2012, Connecticut\u2019s lone nuclear power plant shut down one of its two units because the seawater used to cool the plant was too warm. The heat wave that struck Europe this summer forced utilities to scale back electricity production at nuclear plants in Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. In France the utility EDF shut down four reactors in one day.\n\n\u201cAlready they\u2019re having trouble competing against natural gas and renewable energy,\u201d said John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cAdd onto that high water temperatures, high air temperatures and drought. It\u2019s just another challenge.\u201d\n\nBut water has yet to pose an existential crisis. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that it considers climate change when reviewing applications for nuclear plants\u2019 construction or operation permits and that it has never rejected one over concerns about dwindling cooling water resources.\n\n\u201cFor plants on lakes and rivers, the basic consideration will continue to be whether or not the water level in that body is high enough to meet the conditions of the license,\u201d said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \u201cTo this point, there have been no indications in the NRC\u2019s analyses to suggest that plants would have to deal with the potential for the water bodies to no longer be able to fulfill their function.\u201d\n\nIf or when that situation arises, a plant would have to propose a plan to maintain the requirements of the license, likely by reducing water intake and cutting electricity production, he said.\n\nThere are ways to make nuclear plants more efficient with water. Closed-loop systems already cool 40 percent of the country\u2019s reactors. For more than a decade, regulators and industry players have been discussing the feasibility of air-cooled condensers, which use electricity generated by the plant to power air conditioners that cool reactors without water. But the technology siphons roughly 7 percent of the power produced by the plant and has yet to be installed at any U.S. nuclear station, according to the industry-funded Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\nEIA Expected changes in the availability of water for cooling will pose problems for plants far from the coasts.\n\nAnother approach is to use recycled water. To cool its three reactors, the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona sources most of the 20,000 gallons it uses per minute from reclaimed sewage from a treatment plant near Phoenix \u2014 a technique hailed in 2016 as \u201ca feat of engineering\u201d amid a drought.\n\nBreakthroughs like that could make nuclear an attractive option for powering solutions to water scarcity in the years to come, such as desalinating brackish or saltwater and moving it to drought-parched regions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s energy intensive,\u201d said Matt Wald, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute. \u201cIf you want to do that without adding carbon emissions, you\u2019re likely to look at nuclear power as a way to do that.\u201d\n\nThat, however, gets to the heart of the biggest question looming over the nuclear industry: Is it, given the radioactive waste it produces, clean energy?\n\nFor the growing number of states and municipalities pledging to use 100 percent renewable energy by the middle of the century, the answer is maybe.\n\nHawaii became the first state to adopt a 100 percent renewable electricity rule in 2015, pledging to quit gas and coal by 2045. The law makes no mention of nuclear, probably because the archipelago state has no reactors and requires a minimum two-thirds vote from both houses of the legislature to approve the construction of a nuclear plant or radioactive waste site.\n\nThe 100 percent clean electricity bill that California passed in August mandates that the state generate 60 percent of its electricity from renewables like wind and solar by 2030. But it gives regulators another 15 years after that to complete the overhaul with energy sources considered nonrenewable, including nuclear power, large hydropower dams and gas-fired power plants that capture and store emissions.\n\nA statute that Atlanta passed in June to get the city to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 is vague, listing nuclear as a source of clean energy but vowing to get all its power from renewables.\n\nFor the Sierra Club, the environmental giant making a huge push to get cities and states to go all renewable, nuclear power is \u201ca uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity\u201d and \u201cno solution to climate change.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Mr. Trump, who has in recent weeks hinted that the ban would be coming, first called for the Justice Department to re-examine the regulations after a mass shooting in February at a Florida high school left 17 dead.\n\nThe president\u2019s declaration set into motion a chain of events that surprised officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which had already been tasked with reviewing whether the devices could be banned, a directive given after a massacre in Las Vegas in October 2017.\n\nIn that mass shooting, the deadliest in modern history, a gunman using weapons outfitted with a bump stock device killed 58 people.

Right now, Juul is a good nicotine delivery device but the quality is not the same as a cigarette.

As the cells proliferate, they secrete a chemical that causes the bone marrow to fill with scar tissue (\u201cfibrosis\u201d).\n\nThe remaining normal myeloid cells evacuate to safer territory in the spleen, and the spleen swells, squashing the nearby stomach but making the abdomen look overly full. Consequently, the person with the disease becomes progressively malnourished from an inability to take in enough calories. My patient had lost 25 pounds in the preceding six months as a result, even as her waistline expanded and made her feel uncomfortable, even unwieldy from her new girth.\n\nI had prescribed the one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for such conditions, and it worked well for her: Her spleen shrank back to a normal size, she gained back some weight, and she had resumed having a good quality of life."}]
