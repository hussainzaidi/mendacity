Now he wants to prove it.\n\nHis big gamble on a sudden and rapid Syria pullout , which broke on Wednesday, is classic Trump in execution and content after he effectively declared mission accomplished and the defeat of ISIS.\n\nThe President announced an apparently impulsive decision that shook the world, showed little sign of nuanced consideration, confounded top advisers and by the end of the day left Washington in chaos and confusion.\n\nIt was a move that appeared to clash with the central goal of his Middle East policy -- containing Iran's regional influence -- since it could leave a vacuum for Tehran and other outside nations to fill.\n\nTrump's critics inside Washington, his own party, the military and around the world are already portraying his move as a massive strategic blunder that could open the way for an ISIS rebound.\n\n\"It's a mistake of colossal proportions and the President fails to see how it will endanger our country,\" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham, usually a Trump ally, blasted the decision on the Senate floor Wednesday night.\n\n\"This is a stain on the honor of the United States,\" the South Carolina Republican said.\n\n\"I think it's disastrous to our own national security,\" he added.\n\nThere was also a strong suspicion that a President under political and legal siege was casting around for a year-end win to add to a triumph represented by the passage of a criminal justice bill, and to divert attention from a concession in a duel with Congress over funding for his border wall.\n\nTrump released a video on Wednesday evening touting his decision to bring troops home that looked like a bid to lock in a pre-Christmas political boost.\n\n\"Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won, and that's the way we want it. And that's the way they want it,\" the President says in the video.\n\nIn a typically bizarre twist, he also appeared to suggest that Americans killed in Syria were looking down with approval at his decision.\n\nTrump's decision to ditch US leverage in Syria, which fulfills one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's goals, will spark fresh speculation about Trump's motives as his relationship with Russia comes under increasing scrutiny.\n\nIn another win for Moscow, the administration on Wednesday told Congress it was lifting sanctions on two Russian firms. But reflecting the strange duality of US policy on Russia, Washington announced sanctions against 15 members of Moscow's GRU intelligence service and four entities over election interference, an assassination attempt in Britain and other \"malign activities.\"\n\nNo one has ever accused the President of being consistent. But his decision opens him to charges of hypocrisy since Trump branded former President Barack Obama the \"founder\" of ISIS after the group exploited the US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 to build its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOther people's wars\n\nWhile the move to withdraw US special forces from a fraught geopolitical hotspot might have been unexpected, it was squarely in line with Trump's idiosyncratic worldview.\n\nIt's no secret that he believes American troops should not be fighting what he sees as other people's wars, and he tends to view alliances as simply a chance for America's traditional friends to rip off the US.\n\nAnd while Trump's Pentagon and foreign policy aides have been warning that the fight to prevent an ISIS resurgence is not over, the President concocted a more simple reality that satisfies a political goal.\n\n\"We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe President's decision not to schedule a major address to the American people to explain the strategic foundation of his withdrawal added to the impression of a leader uninterested in the details of grave decisions.\n\nUnlike many of the President's most significant, shocking decisions, the Syria withdrawal order did not test constitutional norms and was well within the guardrails of mainstream political thought on overseas deployments.\n\nAfter all, he won the 2016 election; he is the constitutionally empowered civilian commander in chief with the right to give such orders.\n\nAnd the President will not be isolated on Syria.\n\nThere has been a strong feeling among some liberals and conservatives -- dating to Obama's 2008 campaign -- that America's post-9/11 wars should end and the troops should come home.\n\nAnd while the Pentagon and senior US officials have advocated a long-term presence in Syria to prevent a return of ISIS, maximize US leverage in the region and contain Iran, there has been little talk of an exit plan.\n\nConfusion\n\nEven so, Trump's move shared characteristics with many of his previous executive power coups.\n\nIt was a bold move by a President who relishes that power rather than a bottom-up policy process typical in most administrations.\n\nHe is also untroubled that the experts in his administration were advising him to take another course.\n\nOn December 11, for instance, the US special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, Brett McGurk, made an argument that contradicted Trump's reasoning on Wednesday.\n\n\"If we've learned one thing over the years, enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave; you have to make sure the internal security forces are in place to ensure that those gains, security gains, are enduring,\" McGurk said.\n\nAnother characteristic result of Wednesday's announcement was chaos.\n\nTrump's decision -- like his executive order decreeing a travel ban on citizens of some mostly Muslim nations, for instance -- left officials on his own team struggling to explain the implications.\n\nOne senior administration official made available to reporters could not say how many troops have already left Syria or when others would return to the US.\n\nConfusion in the White House will be mirrored abroad, where US allies often struggle to understand the administration's strategic goals.\n\nTrump's go-it-alone move also ranked as yet another insult for America's friends in the West who had sent soldiers to fight and die alongside Americans.\n\nTwo diplomatic sources from countries in the Middle East told CNN's Elise Labott that their countries had not been consulted or informed and news of the planned withdrawal came as a \"total surprise.\"\n\nAs is often the case with Trump's foreign policy decisions, there was also a whiff of some kind of hidden quid pro quo.\n\nThe Syria pullout order came after a call last Friday between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nA US departure from the region could potentially give Turkey an advantage in its efforts to pressure Kurdish rebels in Syria and to stop them from bolstering the Kurdish militant group PKK, which it views as a terrorist organization.\n\nIn another development that could be connected, the United States on Tuesday approved the sale of a $3.5 billion Patriot missile system to Turkey.\n\nIn recent weeks, Erdogan's disclosures about the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul have exposed Trump to criticism from Republican senators over his support for Saudi Arabia's crown prince, who is accused of ordering the killing.\n\nWashington observers will now be watching to see whether Erdogan dials down the Khashoggi issue."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sr. admin official: 'A mistake of colossal proportions'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/o2CTSNXs3v8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Seated at the head of his Situation Room conference table, President Donald Trump was adamant: American troops must come home from Syria . He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio. The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise. So he gave them six months.\n\nEight months later, planning for the withdrawal is now underway -- against the advice of those same officials, who warned in April that Russia and Iran would gain stronger footholds in Syria when the US presence there evaporates.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, even some of Trump's GOP allies were warning of a grave mistake.\n\n\"My sense is that it's been a shock through the administration that this was made,\" Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Wednesday after returning from the White House, where he had traveled to meet with Trump but was told as he waited the meeting was canceled.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication, with this little preparation,\" Corker said. \"I mean, my understanding is that we're beginning to move out right now.\"\n\nHurried discussions continued Wednesday about the timing and pace of the troop withdrawal, which the White House said has already begun. The announcement lacked the formality of previous presidents' declarations they would remove troops from war zones: the White House did not schedule any presidential remarks nor provide any concrete details of the decision.\n\nTrump issued his first public comments on the decision Wednesday evening in a video message posted to Twitter, in which he pointed to the sky to reference US military personnel who have been killed in Syria.\n\n\"We have won against ISIS,\" Trump said. \"We've beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land and now it's time for our troops to come back home. I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country.\"\n\nHe added later, \"So our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won, and that's the way we want it.\" Trump then pointed to the sky and said, \"And that's the way they want it.\"\n\nAfter historic victories against ISIS, it's time to bring our great young people home! pic.twitter.com/xoNjFzQFTp \u2014 Donald J.

MUST WATCH U.S. preparing for \"full\" and \"rapid\" withdrawal from Syria 08:09\n\nIn conversations over the past several days, top presidential advisers have counseled Trump that withdrawing personnel from Syria would amount to a retreat from the region and allow adversarial nations to gain influence. Those cautioning against a rapid and immediate withdrawal included Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nResistance to the move was strong among some in the administration. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that the President's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria is \"a mistake of colossal proportions and the President fails to see how it will endanger our country.\"\n\n\"Senior officials across the administration agree that the President's decision-by-tweet will recklessly put American and allied lives in danger around the world, take the pressure off of ISIS -- allowing them to reconstitute -- and hand a strategic victory to our Syrian, Iranian and Russian adversaries,\" the official said.\n\nDiplomatic sources from two countries in the region said their countries were not consulted or informed, and described the news of the planned withdrawal as a \"total surprise.\"\n\nTrump did alert one key ally two days ahead of the announcement: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a phone call with Trump on Monday, and a subsequent conversation with Pompeo on Tuesday, the US leaders assured him the Americans had \"other ways of expressing their influence in the area,\" according to a statement from Netanyahu's office.\n\nIn a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, lawmakers gave Vice President Mike Pence an \"earful\" about the decision, according to Corker.\n\nSpeaking afterward, Corker said he felt badly for the vice president, who was acting as an emissary to angry lawmakers.\n\n\"He had talking points,\" Corker said. \"There's no way he could really defend. He did what a loyal soldier would do.\"\n\nTrump's top ally in the Senate, Sen. Lindsay Graham, was firmer.\n\n\"I want you to tell the President directly that this is a huge mistake,\" he said he told Pence. \"You are putting in motion ISIS getting a foothold again. They are not defeated.\"\n\nPence addressed the issue by saying Trump \"made a commitment to get out of foreign entanglements,\" Graham said. But the vice president himself ignored reporters' questions on the matter, instead staring ahead blankly as he departed.\n\nIt was an astonishing level of pushback from Republicans who, time and again, have avoided overt criticism of their party's leader. It reflected deep unease among national security experts and advisers about the decision to abruptly withdraw troops from Syria without consulting members of Congress or gathering consensus among the administration's national security team.\n\nIt was Trump's decision\n\nJUST WATCHED Graham on Syria: This is a high-risk strategy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Graham on Syria: This is a high-risk strategy 02:39\n\nAn administration official briefing reporters on Wednesday insisted anyone caught off guard by the decision hasn't been paying attention. But the official did not dispute that some of the President's top advisers were opposed to the withdrawal.\n\n\"The President's statements on this topic have been 100% consistent from the campaign through his announcement today, so I think the notion that anyone within the administration was caught unaware, I would challenge that, quite frankly,\" the official said. \"It was the President's decision to make and he made it.\"\n\nStill, the decision only highlighted discrepancies among administration officials over the future of the roughly 2,000 troops deployed in the country.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this month that the US needed to train thousands of local fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the terror group. Only last week, the US special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition Brett McGurk said US forces would remain in Syria even after the terror group was defeated.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,\" he said on December 11.\n\nAnd in September, Bolton told reporters on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly that US troops would remain in Syria to counter Iran.\n\n\"We're not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,\" Bolton said.\n\nPressed about whether Bolton's comments were still applicable, the senior administration official suggested previous statements no longer applied.\n\n\"The issue here is that the President has made a decision, and so previous statements ... he gets to do that, that's his prerogative,\" said the official, briefing reporters during a call organized by the White House.\n\nThe official could not provide a timeline for the withdrawal of US troops nor say whether the US would continue to carry out airstrikes in Syria, instead referring questions to the Pentagon.\n\n\"It's not information I have,\" the official said.\n\nIf administration officials and Trump's allies in Congress were distressed by the decision, however, there was little excuse for them to be surprised. Trump has long railed against foreign entanglements begun by his predecessors and vowed this spring to bring American troops home.\n\n\"We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,\" he said in April, comments that prompted a hurried effort at the Pentagon and in the National Security Council to convince the President that an immediate withdrawal could throw the region into chaos.\n\nWhen military brass sought to dissuade him, he grew frustrated and complained at length about the amount of American money being spent in the region, which he said had produced nothing for the US in return, according to senior administration officials.\n\n'Beside themselves'\n\nDespite his annoyance, Trump eventually agreed to hold off on immediately pulling troops from the war-plagued nation, even after airing his displeasure with top national security officials. At one stage, Dunford asked the President to state explicitly what he wanted to see happen in Syria, according to an administration official.\n\nThe President responded by saying US troops need to finish their mission against ISIS in Syria within six months, a timeline military officials -- including Mattis -- warned would be too short, according to the administration official. Trump responded by telling his team to just get it done.\n\nOne person familiar with the meeting said attendees left \"beside themselves\" about how a hasty withdrawal and cutting of funds for recovery projects like restoring water and power and rebuilding roads could affect the future of Syria, and make it more likely that ISIS could return to prominence.\n\nDerek Chollet, a former US assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, said much of Washington, including administration officials, lawmakers and Iran hawks have been the victims of \"wishful thinking\" when it comes to Trump.\n\n\"We've learned over and over, on issue after issue, that the President has his views, his instincts and that the administration is more often than not on a different page,\" Chollet said. \"He's shown time and again he doesn't listen to logic or reason.\"\n\nAdvocates of a traditional hawkish GOP foreign policy have been \"rationalizing that Donald Trump was going to ratchet up the pressure on Syria,\" said Chollet, now an executive vice president at the German Marshall Fund, when Trump has long said he would pull out of the country, which has been ravaged by a civil war that started in 2011.\n\n\"He campaigned on this, he talked about it at a rally,\" Chollet said of Trump's desire to end US involvement in Syria. \"This has been hiding in plain sight. He has been consistent on this issue.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sen.

It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few.\n\nThe year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act.\n\nYou say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\n\nUntil you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis.\n\nWe need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself.\n\nWe have not come here to beg world leaders to care.

Destructive storms now slam the island nation with increasing frequency and power, he adds.\n\n\"We have to continually respond -- provide relief to communities that are affected and then begin the process of rehabilitating, reconstructing infrastructure,\" he says. \"Before you're finished, the next one comes along so you're constantly in a state of responding, relief, rehabilitation.\"\n\nA boy walks through through the ruins of his family home with his father Phillip in 2015 in Port Vila, Vanuatu after Cyclone Pam.\n\nVanuatu contributes a miniscule .0016% of global emissions, claims Regenvanu, but is facing \"the brunt of the climate effects.\"\n\n\"We're the ones who are suffering most so we need to be compensated by those who have benefited from this damage that we're now suffering.\"\n\nThe power of the courts\n\nIf Vanuatu sues it will add to a growing trend of climate change litigation.\n\nBefore 2014, only 12 countries had climate law suits -- by March 2017, nearly 900 such cases had been filed in 24 countries, according to the UN Environment Programme.\n\n\"There's just a tremendous urgency to take action now, so environmental groups, citizens, states and cities are taking to the courts to try and force action,\" says Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe majority of climate change lawsuits have been filed in the US.\n\n\"Governments are almost always the defendants in climate change cases,\" according to a 2017 UN Environment global review of climate change litigation.\n\nIn 2015, activist group Our Children's Trust filed a law suit in the state of Oregon against the federal government. \"I am suing the US government for taking direct action that puts my generation disproportionately at risk from climate change, and violating my constitutional rights to life, liberty and property,\" Vic Barrett, a 19-year-old American university student and member of Our Children's Trust, told CNN at the COP24 climate talks.\n\nThat year, attorneys for the federal government filed a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nAmong the defense's arguments were that the law suit \"presents a generalized attack on government action and inaction regarding climate change, rather than a challenge to specifically identifiable violations of law that can be concretely rectified by a favorable decision.\"\n\nVic Barrett, member of Our Children's Trust.\n\nTen days before a scheduled trial last October, the US Supreme Court issued a stay, temporarily halting proceedings. The case is now in limbo in the 9th District Court.\n\nOther American plaintiffs have also stepped forward.\n\nLast summer, the smallest state in the US, Rhode Island, announced it was \"suing the world's largest fossil fuel companies for knowingly contributing to climate change and the catastrophic consequences to the state and its residents, economy, eco-system, and infrastructure.\"\n\nThe 21 defendants named in that case include oil giants ExxonMobil, BP and Shell.\n\nBarely 10 days after the case was filed, the defendants succeeded in having the case moved from state to federal court.

Moments later, Elon Musk's vision for how to beat traffic congestion began to take shape.\n\nThe lift slowly lowered our carinto O'Leary Station, a circular hole Musk's Boring Company had dug in the parking lot in Hawthorne, California. A handful of company employees were gathered around the edge, watching our descent.\n\nThe lift settled at the bottom of the pit. Looking through the windshield, the other three journalists and I saw what we'd come for \u2014 Musk's first tunnel, a 1.14-mile route built to experiment with underground transportation technology.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla ( TSLA ) and SpaceX, had previously described his tunnel business as a hobby that started as a joke.\n\nIn 2016, a frustrated Musk said he planned to start digging tunnels to provide an alternative to Los Angeles' congested highways. Why sit in traffic above ground when you could speed ahead below it?\n\nNow the joke has turned into something very real. The billionaire entrepreneur has started to deliver on his talk of offering a \"weird little Disney ride in the middle of LA.\"\n\nOur Model X inched forward. It was fitted out with special protruding wheels that held the SUV in place between the tunnel's walls. Previous iterations of the tunnel had placed the SUV on an electric skate, which propelled it. Now the vehicles in Musk's tunnels power themselves. The Boring Company said it switched because this was a simpler solution.\n\nRed lights atop the tunnel suddenly turned green. The Model X jolted forward and we were off. The trip was bumpy at times as we jostled against the tunnel. The narrow space made the low speeds \u2014 we traveled mostly at 35 mph \u2014 feel faster. It felt like an amusement park ride. After about two minutes, the car emerged from the tunnel into a large pit in the SpaceX parking lot.\n\nA Tesla sits at an entrance to the Boring Company's test tunnel.\n\nWe walked out of the pit into the shadow of a medieval tower that Musk constructed as a tribute to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In November, the Boring Company even advertised for the job of watchtower guard.\n\n\"We need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent,\" Musk tweeted, a nod to a scene in the 1975 film.\n\nTo mark the opening of the tunnel, Musk and the Boring Company threw a private party in the parking lot Tuesday night. It included a knight yelling insults, s'mores lit with flamethrowers and a speech from Musk.\n\nAside from its quirky name and unusual job openings like \"vice president of digital dancing,\" the Boring Company is attempting serious projects in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.\n\nThe Boring Company has dug an entrance to its test tunnel in a corner of SpaceX's parking lot.\n\nMusk's 'eureka moment'\n\nMusk expressed confidence in the projects in a conversation with reporters Tuesday.\n\n\"For me it was a eureka moment,\" he said of his first ride in the tunnel. \"It was a epiphany, it's going to damn well work.\"\n\nThe initial tunnel cost about $10 million, not including the cost of the tunneling machine and research and development. Musk expects a 15-fold improvement in tunneling speed as the Boring Company improves its digging machines.\n\nBut the company has encountered some setbacks recently. In November, it scrapped plans to develop another tunnel in Los Angeles following a lawsuit from neighborhood groups. Instead, it's focusing on a tunnel from the Los Feliz, East Hollywood or Rampart Village neighborhoods to Dodger Stadium. Eventually, Musk hopes to build a tunnel network throughout Los Angeles.\n\nIn Chicago, the Boring Company was selected in June to tunnel a route from downtown to O'Hare Airport. But a contract hasn't been finalized yet, according to a spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Key details like the exact route and pricing remain unclear.\n\nIn Washington, the Boring Company started to dig a square hole in a downtown parking lot this year. The site has been silent in recent months, aside from a covering over the hole. The tent-like structure collapsed this fall and was then removed. The Boring Company is working through an environmental review with regulators before it can build the route to Baltimore.\n\nThe Boring Company's 1.14-mile tunnel is designed to test new transportation technologies.\n\n'It's hard to understand what's real and what's not'\n\nMusk's ambitious projects have left nearby residents unsure what to think. The developers of a condo building next door to the Washington site told CNN they've debated if they could advertise proximity to a future Boring Company station as a selling point. Ultimately, they decided to hold off formally promoting the station.\n\n\"It's the kind of thing that feels so far fetched it's hard to recognize it as an imminent reality,\" said Brook Katzen, senior vice president of development at Urban Investment Partners. \"We don't want to sell homes based on a glimmer of hope.\"\n\nTanner Woodford, executive director of the Design Museum of Chicago, which is a few floors above where the downtown Boring Company station would go, has been watching to see what Musk does next.\n\n\"It's hard to understand what's real and what's not,\" Woodford said. \"He could tell me he's putting a Christmas tree on Mars next week and I'd think that's about right. I have no idea what he's capable of.\"\n\nMusk acknowledged Tuesday that the Boring Company is a work in progress.\n\n\"We're obviously at the early stages here. This is a prototype. We're figuring things out,\" he said. \"I think there is a path to alleviating traffic congestion in cities.\"\n\nshift some projects to Musk presented an updated version of the Loop, the form of transportation he initially plans to use in the tunnels. The plan is to eventuallyshift some projects to Hyperloops , the high-speed capsule in a vacuum tube that Musk envisions whisking passengers from Washington to New York in 29 minutes.\n\nFor now, Musk is focused on the Loop in which autonomous electric vehicles, such as the Tesla Model 3 or the unreleased Model Y, would transport passengers. Private vehicles (not just Teslas) would also be allowed in Musk's tunnels, provided they're outfitted with deployable tracking wheels that rub against the walls to hold vehicles in place.\n\n\"This is not meant to be some walled garden or something that's special just for Tesla,\" Musk said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Illinois AG says Catholic Church failed to disclose abuse accusations against 500 priests and clergy", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/PMhEryiuYYI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In yet another blow to the Catholic Church in the United States, Illinois' attorney general says the state's six dioceses have failed to disclose accusations of sexual abuse against at least 500 priests and clergy members.\n\nIllinois' dioceses have released lists publicly identifying 185 clergy members who had been credibly accused of child sex abuse. But state Attorney General Lisa Madigan said preliminary findings in her ongoing investigation reveal that the church failed to disclose sexual abuse allegations against at least 500 additional priests and clergy members.\n\nIn many cases, the accusations have \"not been adequately investigated by the dioceses or not investigated at all,\" Madigan's office said in a statement Wednesday. What's more, the statement added, the church often failed to notify law enforcement authorities or state Department of Children and Family Services about the allegations.\n\n\"By choosing not to thoroughly investigate allegations, the Catholic Church has failed in its moral obligation to provide survivors, parishioners and the public a complete and accurate accounting of all sexually inappropriate behavior involving priests in Illinois,\" Madigan said in the statement.\n\n\"The failure to investigate also means that the Catholic Church has never made an effort to determine whether the conduct of the accused priests was ignored or covered up by superiors.\"\n\nMadigan began her investigation in August, after a Pennsylvania grand jury released a 900-page report detailing horrific abuses by 300 Catholic clergy against more than 1,000 victims. Since then, 36 dioceses have publicized self-reported lists of clergy \"credibly accused\" of abusing minors. (There are 197 dioceses in the United States.)\n\nBut advocates for survivors of sexual abuse have challenged many of the lists, calling them incomplete or evasive. Few of the lists detail exactly when the abuse claims were made, or what was done about them. Madigan's criticism seems to lend credence to those claims.\n\n\"The preliminary stages of this investigation have already demonstrated that the Catholic Church cannot police itself,\" Madigan said. \"Allegations of sexual abuse of minors, even if they stem from conduct that occurred many years ago, cannot be treated as internal personnel matters.\"\n\nBased on their review of the Illinois dioceses' internal files, the dioceses have received sex-abuse-related allegations for approximately 690 clergy, according to the attorney general's report . But they publicly reported just 185 of the allegations.\n\nNearly 75% of the allegations were either not investigated or were investigated but not substantiated, according to the report.\n\nIn many cases, the dioceses said they had not conducted investigations because the priest or clergy member was dead or had already resigned by the time the allegation was reported to the dioceses, according to the attorney general's office. It did not specify which of Illinois' six dioceses were responsible for the unreported accusations.\n\nIn other cases, the dioceses failed to \"substantiate\" an allegation when it came from only one survivor, even when church officials had reason to believe that survivor and reason to investigate further, according to the report.\n\n\"The dioceses also often found reasons to discredit survivors' stories of abuse by focusing on the survivors' personal lives,\" the report says.\n\nIn a statement, the head of Illinois' archdiocese, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, said that since 2002, the archdiocese has reported all allegations -- regardless of whether the accused is living or dead -- to civil authorities.\n\nThe Diocese of Joliet said that it has \"received no formal or informal indication from the Attorney General that we failed to adequately investigate any allegation of abuse and/or report it to authorities. The Attorney General has also not informed the Diocese of Joliet of any inaccuracies or omissions in our files that would prompt additions or corrections to the list of priests with credible allegations that is on our website.\"\n\nThe six dioceses in Illinois are: Chicago, an archdiocese, and Belleville, Joliet, Peoria, Rockford and Springfield.\n\n\"The Dioceses of Belleville, Peoria, Rockford, and Springfield did not take the basic step of publishing a comprehensive list of clergy who had been 'credibly accused' until the Office became involved,\" the report says.\n\nBishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield said his diocese has cooperated with the attorney general's investigation, but the decision to withhold names in the past was done with \"a virtuous intent.\"\n\n\"Reviewing these past cases has also reminded us that many years ago people didn't publicly discuss the kind of salacious allegations documented in these files,\" Paprocki said in a statement.\n\n\"A virtuous intent to protect the faithful from scandal unfortunately prevented the transparency and awareness that has helped us confront this problem more directly over the past fifteen years.

They just knew these looked like OK people and they were in close races. And they were interested in national results.\"\n\nThe nonprofit has seen explosive growth since its founding in 2004 during President George W. Bush's re-election campaign -- when it processed less than $1 million across all federal races.\n\nTwo years later, the number had jumped to $16 million. By 2016, the last presidential cycle, it had hit nearly $695 million before nearly doubling to more than $1.2 billion in the 2018 election.\n\nThe group has seized on advances in technology -- the advent of one-click donating and Apple wallet, for instance -- to allow motivated donors to act quickly when candidates or causes catch their attention. Nearly 6 million maintain \"express\" accounts that store donors' payment information and addresses, making it easier to donate to multiple candidates over an election cycle.\n\nThe group's central role in Democratic fundraising means its constant testing and tweaks -- such as experiments to see whether enlarging or moving the \"donate\" button yields more contributions -- immediately benefit thousands of candidates, Hill told CNN.\n\nSheldon Cohen, a retired counselor who lives in Hopewell Junction, New York, used ActBlue to donate to more Democratic candidates than he can remember -- sending $10 or $25 at a time to Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign or to the re-election campaign of Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb. (O'Rourke lost; Lamb won.)\n\nCohen, whose credit card information is stored with ActBlue, said he often sat on his computer, reading Twitter during the campaign and \"if a candidate appealed to me I would send a few bucks here and few bucks there.\"\n\n\"It was money they couldn't raise in their own states,\" he said. \"As a liberal, I felt like I was helping.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump's pick for attorney general warns Mueller's obstruction inquiry 'fatally misconceived' in memo to DOJ", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/S8C5oSGQOWg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Former Attorney General William \"Bill\" Barr, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, reached a decisive and controversial conclusion that Trump's interactions with ex-FBI Director James Comey would not constitute obstruction of justice, according to a copy of a newly released June 2018 memo to senior Justice officials.\n\nThe fact that Barr weighed in on such a sensitive issue and would be poised to oversee Mueller's work, if confirmed as attorney general, will undoubtedly now thrust his nomination into greater controversy.\n\nBarr has not shied away from defending Trump's firing of Comey , but the June 8 memo -- first reported by the Wall Street Journal and provided to lawmakers late Wednesday -- offers a detailed analysis of one of the most consequential episodes of Trump's presidency, concluding that while he's \"in the dark about many facts,\" special counsel Robert Mueller's obstruction inquiry was \"fatally misconceived.\" Barr adds that Trump asking Comey to let go of the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and later firing Comey were within his powers as head of the executive branch.\n\n\"Mueller should not be able to demand that the President submit to an interrogation about alleged obstruction,\" Barr wrote. \"If embraced by the Department, this theory would have potentially disastrous implications, not just for the Presidency, but for the Executive branch as a whole and the Department in particular.\"\n\nThe full repercussions of the President's behavior toward Comey are yet to be resolved, as the matter is still under investigation by Mueller.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Graham: Trump's Syria withdrawal a 'stain on the honor of the United States'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/98rRft3pmo0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Republican Sen.

Jeff Flake, who was presiding over the session, jokingly said that Rudolph had voted \"present,\" a comment that met with laughter inside the chamber.\n\nFor several hours ahead of the vote, the bill was held up over a push to advance public lands legislation.

Lisa Murkowski expressed disappointment, saying \"this is something that I wish we had been able to resolve.\" But the package is now on track to come up for a vote in the next Congress.\n\nSchumer told reporters that he and McConnell made a commitment to supporters to bring the lands' package up as one of the first votes in January.\n\nThe next step for the stop-gap funding effort is the House of Representatives where it is likely to pass despite some conservative opposition.\n\nPelosi, the House Democratic leader who is poised to reclaim the speaker's gavel in the new Congress, said Wednesday afternoon that she supported the measure.\n\n\"This is a missed opportunity to pass full-year funding bills now,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"However, Democrats will be ready to fully, responsibly fund our government in January, and we will support this continuing resolution.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said during a speech on the Senate floor, \"Thankfully, President Trump appears to have backed down from his position for billions in direct appropriations for a border wall.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have made clear they don't want a shutdown, but had been at an impasse over the President's demand for $5 billion in funding for his long-promised wall at the US-Mexico border.\n\nDemocrats have made clear that figure is a non-starter for them and any spending bill would need at least some Democratic votes to pass in the Senate.\n\nOf course, no spending measure is final until the President signs it.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the White House appeared to step away from the brink of a shutdown.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday morning during an interview with Fox News that, \"We have other ways that we can get to that $5 billion (for a border wall).\"\n\nMembers of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and other conservative allies of the President plan gave brief speeches on the House floor Wednesday night, however, urging Trump not to abandon his quest for border wall funding.\n\nThey included: Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Morgan Griffith of Virginia.\n\nDespite opposition from the Freedom Caucus, however, the House should still have the votes to still pass the continuing resolution, assuming most, if not all, Democrats support it, since it has Pelosi's blessing.\n\nBut even as members of the Freedom Caucus are poised to urge Trump not to abandon his quest for border wall funding, White House officials say it's likely the President will do just that -- and sign a short-term spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe President has been unusually quiet about the issue on Wednesday, holding his tongue as some conservative commentators and lawmakers blast him for abandoning his commitment.\n\nBut two White House aides said the President likely has no choice but to sign a temporary funding measure to keep the government open until February 8. The aides say the White House is intentionally not signaling what Trump will do, but there does not appear to be talk inside the West Wing of blocking it.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway hinted earlier that Trump is leaning this way when she told reporters at the White House the President will \"take a look at\" the continuing resolution, though she attempted to frame any punt as something other than a concession from the White House.\n\nAll this comes a week after the President said he'd be \"proud\" to shut down the government, so delaying the funding fight until Democrats retake the House next year is a fairly clear concession -- and a risky one.

Of those surveyed, 18.6% said they've done so.\n\nThat's an increase from 14.3% of women from 2011 to 2015.\n\nBut that number is very much tied to age. Nearly 2 in 5 women ages 40 to 49, or more than 39%, relied on their sterilization for contraception. For women 30 to 39, the figure was about 1 in 5, or more than 21.5%. And for women 20 to 29, only 1 in 20, or about 4%, had had a tubal ligation.\n\n\"Sterilization has been a common form of contraception both due to its permanence and ability to have it done after delivery of a child when someone is already getting health care,\" Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist and board member for the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, wrote in an email. \"Many poor women may not have access to contraception outside of a childbirth (where emergency insurance is often obtainable) so may want something convenient and long lasting.\"\n\nThe pill\n\nThe second most common contraceptive method was the birth control pill. About 12.6% of women reported relying on the pill as contraception.\n\nThat's a decrease from 15.9% from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe new report found that the pill, as it's known, was most popular among women 20 to 29 (19.5%), followed by those 15 to 19 (16.6%) and then 30 to 39 (11%), followed by only slightly more than 5% of women 40 to 49.\n\n\"The pill and permanent sterilization for women have been the most common method of contraception since 1982, according to the Guttmacher institute,\" wrote Dr. Lillian Schapiro, an Atlanta gynecologist in private practice, in an email.\n\nLong-acting contraception\n\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives, including intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, were used by 10.3% of respondents, making them the third most common method.\n\nThis is an increase from 2011 to 2015, when they were used by 8% of those surveyed.\n\nThe new report found use was highest for women ages 20 to 29 (13.1%), followed by those 30 to 39 (11.7%). More than 8% of respondents 15 to 19 used these methods, while less than 7% of women 40 to 49 did.\n\n\"LARC's are very safe now and becoming much more accepted,\" Schapiro wrote. \"For women not ready to permanently prevent pregnancy they are a great option since they don't require remembering a pill every day and keeping up to date on a prescription.\"\n\nMale condoms\n\nMale condoms were the fourth most common method, used by 8.7% of those surveyed.\n\nThat's a decline from 9.2% of respondents reporting use from 2011 to 2015.\n\nNow, women 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 used condoms the most: 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively.

That's an increase from 4.5% of those surveyed from 2011 to 2015.\n\nDepo-Provera (a birth control shot), the contraceptive ring or the patch accounted for 3.2% of used methods. And all other methods were used with 5.6% of women.\n\n\"The pill and sterilization are our oldest forms of birth control and women are more familiar with them, so many women use what they are familiar with. However, as newer devices come unto the market and become popular, that may change,\" Brandi said.\n\nThe new report found that contraceptive use went up with age, with 37.2% of women 15 to 19, 61.9% of those 20 to 29, 72% of women 30 to 39 and 73.7% of women 40 to 49 using contraception.\n\nContraceptive pill use was highest among non-Hispanic white women (14.9%); 9.2% of Hispanic women and 8.3% of non-Hispanic black women reported relying on the pill.\n\nCondom use and long-acting reversible contraceptive use, across racial backgrounds, did not differ with any significance.\n\nEducation levels also made a difference in what methods women used. The higher the level of education, the less likely a woman was to rely on sterilization. Of women who were sterilized, 41.9% had no high school diploma or GED, 32.1% had a high school diploma or GED, 23.7% had some college education, and 11.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nConversely, use of the pill went up according to education levels. Of those who relied on contraceptive pills, 4.9% had no high school degree or GED, 7% had a high school degree or GED, 10.1% had some college, and 16.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\n\"It is important to understand what certain demographics are using so we understand their preferences and make sure that everyone has access to all forms of contraception,\" Brandi noted.\n\nThe 35% of women who were not using contraception when they were interviewed were either not sexually active (17%), were pregnant, were postpartum or were looking to get pregnant (7.5%), nonusers of contraception who'd been sexually active (7.9%) or nonusers for other reasons, like nonsurgical sterility (2.7%)."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "New year brings altered landscape for abortion battle", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/tLxnC9ySkhc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Those engaged in the battle over abortion in the United States are looking out at the thorny landscape and gearing up for what is on the horizon in 2019.\n\nWhat they see includes a more conservative US Supreme Court, 85 confirmed judges appointed by President Donald Trump who are reshaping the courts, and legislative bodies -- both state and federal -- transformed by a contentious midterm election.\n\nExperts from four groups dedicated to protecting abortion access spoke with reporters on a conference callMonday afternoon to discuss what lies ahead from their perspective. On the call were representatives from the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Network of Abortion Funds\n\nThey spoke of the more than 400-and-counting restrictions to abortion access that have been enacted at the state level since 2010 and vowed that this is not a time to stop fighting. Even though Roe v. Wade remains on the books, they said, some states forge ahead as if it has been overturned. They also discussed how barriers to abortion access effectively prohibit the procedure for many, especially for low-income populations, people of color and younger people.\n\n\"Even today,\" said Jennifer Davlen, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , \"the constitutional right to abortion is more theoretical than real.\"\n\nCourt rulings that deny restrictions simply get ignored or appealed, said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nShe said Louisiana, which has only three abortion clinics, is trying to enact laws to close clinics that are identical to a Texas effort that was struck down by the Supreme Court two years ago in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\nBy instituting \"systematic barriers,\" states are chipping away at what should be protected, said Rachel Sussman, national director of state policy and advocacy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America\n\nThat means the threat to Roe v. Wade remains strong, even as the support of it has grown, they said. Several mentioned a Gallup Poll from the summer that showed nearly two-thirds of Americans -- or 64% -- want to uphold the 1973 Supreme Court decision, including 41% of Republicans.\n\nSussman pointed out how three states -- Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan -- kicked out anti-abortion governors. And other states, including New York, Rhode Island and New Mexico, worked to codify protections for abortion access.\n\n\"Voters did their jobs at the polls,\" she said. \"Now, we're going to get to work to put their will into action.\"\n\nThe US Supreme Court announced this month that it would not take up a case that might have stopped Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the court chose to honor two lower court decisions that prohibited cuts to funding in Kansas and Louisiana. The high court's decision was backed by new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, making some wonder whether he might not be as conservative as anticipated.\n\nHe and Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to side with the court's liberals, signaling an effort to avoid high-profile abortion-related issues for now.\n\nThat said, both justices \"likely have serious objections,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But such votes seem to be a signal that they would rather avoid contentious, high-profile disputes for now, at least where possible.\"\n\nA representative from Planned Parenthood insisted Monday that this was a case about Medicaid, not abortion, and that Kavanaugh's \"troubling record\" showed he couldn't be trusted.\n\nSteven Aden, chief legal officer and legal counsel at Americans United for Life, also refused to take the Supreme Court decision as a sign.\n\n\"We're not drawing any conclusions,\" he said. \"There are a number of reasons why the court could have elected not to take the case.\"\n\nAmericans United for Life is a national anti-abortion group that uses legislation, education and litigation to advance its cause. Aden said he's looking ahead with optimism, focusing on the legislative issues and fights that he imagines down the pipeline.\n\nSpecifically, he highlighted four model pieces of legislation his organization has written that he hopes will gain traction next year across the country.\n\nThe Abortion Reporting Act seeks to require reporting of all abortion-related complications and emergencies, the idea being that the procedure is \"practiced in the dark,\" Aden said. \"Only when such a system is in place will we finally be able to unmask the reality of abortion in America.\"\n\nThe Women's Health Defense Act seeks to ban abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation, except in some cases of medical emergency. \"Abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more dangerous to a woman than carrying to term,\" he said.\n\nThe Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act forbids selective abortions \"seeking to target babies,\" Aden said, based on prenatal diagnostic testing that shows the gender of the baby or a diagnosis such as Down syndrome.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLastly, Aden pointed to the Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which he said \"treats human lives in the womb as just that, human,\" and requires \"cremation or proper burial\" of \"miscarried, stillborn or aborted infants\" and protection from \"scientific experimentation.\"\n\nAll of these efforts are precisely what proponents of abortion access are preparing to address.

However, they mistakenly believe e-cigarettes are \"cool\" and \"safe,\" he added.\n\n\"Studies show youth like my son [who is 14] have no clue what's in these products,\" Adams said. Meanwhile, a third of kids who have used e-cigs have used marijuana in them.\n\n\"The bottom line,\" according to Alex Azar, the US secretary of health and human services, is that \"in the datasets we use, we have never seen use of any substance rise this rapidly.\"\n\nThe percentage of high school-age children reporting past 30-day use of e-cigarettes rose by more than 75% between 2017 and 2018, while use among middle school-age kids increased nearly 50%, the National Youth Tobacco Survey showed. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health's Monitoring the Future survey , released Monday, recorded a single year surge with more than 37% of 12th graders reporting use in the past year compared to nearly 28% in 2017.\n\nThe skyrocketing rise in e-cigarettes comes at a time when there are \"encouraging signs elsewhere\" -- namely, the fact that alcohol use, tobacco use and opioid use among youth have declined, Azar said.\n\nHowever, the epidemic of vaping could contribute to \"a whole generation addicted to nicotine,\" he said noting that no amount of nicotine is safe.\n\n\"I'm talking about my own kids,\" Adams said. \"My 14, 13 and 9-year-olds are all familiar to these products since elementary school.\"\n\nMisconceptions and myths surrounding e-cigarettes contribute to the epidemic, he added. Meanwhile, parents do not even know what signs to look for or what questions to ask their kids.\n\nWhich is why Adams took the step of issuing an advisory. It's the second time he's taken such action. In April , he issued an advisory to get more Americans to carry the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.\n\nE-cigarettes are not harmless\n\nLike regular cigarettes, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, an addictive drug that harms the developing brains of teens. Because the brain continues to develop until about age 25, nicotine's negative health effects include damage to learning, memory and attention abilities. Add to that, teens who use nicotine are at increased risk for addiction to other drugs.\n\n\"The number one reason teens say they use these products is because they say they have flavors in them,\" said Adams, who noted that many e-cigarettes come in kid-friendly flavors.\n\nSarah Ryan, a high school senior from Holbrook, Massachusetts, who also spoke at the news conference, said there are over 8,000 flavors. Some \"taste like Sour Patch Kids,\" she said. The flavors hide the nicotine, which most kids don't even know is there, she added.\n\nSome of the chemicals used to make certain flavors may also pose health risks, according to Adams. In addition to nicotine, the vapor from e-cigs may include other harmful substances, including heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\n\nWhile e-cigarettes may contain less harmful chemicals than other tobacco products, Adams cautioned, \"Less harm does not mean harmless.\"\n\nSpreading like 'wildfire' in high school\n\nKids, though, believe it's just \"water and flavor,\" said school substance abuse counselor Mila Vascones-Gatski who also spoke at the news conference. The smell is more difficult to detect and the cloud of vapor dissipates so quickly it's hard for anyone to see, though increasingly teachers report kids are vaping in a classroom. \"How do we know? They take selfies of themselves vaping in the classroom,\" she said.\n\nThe surge in e-cigarette use among teens has been fueled by cartridge-based devices, which look like a USB flash drive. The newest devices are not only easy to conceal but most parents would not recognize them as anything other than a tech item. The most ubiquitous version is called Juul, which now has more than a 70% share of the cartridge-based e-cigarette market in the United States, according to the surgeon general.\n\nA typical Juul cartridge, or \"pod,\" contains about as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.\n\nRyan said a sixth-grader told her, \"it was easier to get someone to loan him a Juul than a pencil.\"\n\nShe also said that this year, e-cigarette use \"really spread like wildfire.\" Her high school had to shut down one of the bathrooms due to vaping, she said, while some kids have been caught vaping during class. Meanwhile, she said a convenience store directly across the street from her school has sold e-cigarette products.\n\nTargeting those who sell to kids\n\nConvenience stores are one of the targets of the US Food and Drug Administration, according to Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who also spoke at the news conference. With him at the helm, the agency has taken aggressive steps and will continue to do so over the next couple of months. He hopes to limit both the access and appeal these products have to kids, which he will try to accomplish by stepping up enforcement activities at stores where kids get access to e-cigarettes.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's my belief that we've been successful in this country at stigmatizing tobacco products among kids,\" Gottlieb said. \"We haven't been effective stigmatizing e-cigarette use.\"\n\nAdams applauded the FDA in September for launching a campaign to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes.\n\nTuesday he recognized the potential of e-cigarettes as a tool of harm reduction among adults who are addicted to traditional cigarettes, but added that today's conference prioritized alerting parents, teachers and health officials about the dangers of youth e-cigarette use.\n\n\"We will not stand for another year of exponential rise in the use of these products,\" Adams said. \"We're far too often -- in health and public health -- late to the game.

And the majority of patients will experience no meaningful benefit.\n\nThose benefits also tend to decrease over time and come with the risk of side effects such as vomiting and constipation, according to the review of nearly 100 randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Down the line, risks may include physical dependence and overdose.\n\n\"The benefits of opioids for managing chronic pain tend to be quite modest,\" said study author Jason Busse, associate professor in the department of anesthesia at McMaster University's school of medicine in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSubgroups of the studies included in the analysis suggest that non-opioid alternatives -- such as NSAIDs, certain antidepressants and medical cannabis -- may offer similar benefits to opioids on average. But the evidence for that is less strong, Busse said.\n\nThe analysis comes as federal agencies and other officials in recent years have been cracking down on the prescription of opioids, dually recognized as an important tool in the treatment of pain and as a gateway to physical dependence and addiction.\n\nIn 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines urging doctors to prescribe these drugs more responsibly for people with chronic pain. But Busse said the CDC report set the bar for placebo-controlled studies too high in its analysis; it looked for studies that followed up with patients for at least a year, of which there were none.\n\n\"We have looked at a lot of additional evidence that was not considered by the CDC guidelines,\" he said.\n\nDr. Jianguo Cheng, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said the new analysis reinforces what's become conventional wisdom among pain specialists. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\"We're going to try the least risky drug first, so therefore opioids [are] not a first line of treatment in most cases,\" said Cheng, also the director of director of the Cleveland Clinic Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Program. \"It's not a second line of treatment, and maybe not a third line of treatment.\"\n\nThe CDC describes chronic pain as \"lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing.\" It is among the top reasons for seeking medical care in the US, affecting just over 20% of adults -- about 50 million people -- in 2016, according to one report this year. Other estimates suggest that the number is twice that.\n\n\"It's a very complicated and diverse population of patients,\" Cheng said, including those who may have suffered injuries, had multiple surgeries or live with disability.\n\nThis is differentiated from other kinds of pain, such as acute pain and cancer pain. For the latter, Cheng said, the use of opioids is far less controversial.\n\nJust because most of these patients won't see meaningful improvements, however, is not to ignore the subset that will experience them, Busse said.\n\n\"A problematic interpretation of [the study findings] would be: Opioids don't provide any meaningful pain relief,\" he said. \"The challenge with that interpretation is it assumes that every patient will get the same amount of pain relief.\"\n\nHis study estimates how many chronic pain patients a doctor would need to treat in order for one to experience meaningful improvements: For pain, it's roughly eight patients. For physical functioning, it's 12 patients. For sleep quality, 17 patients.\n\nAnd this is the \"best case scenario,\" according to an editorial published in the same journal by doctors with the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.\n\nThe studies included in the analysis largely weeded out patients with past or present substance use disorder, which Busse described as \"selecting patients that would be prognostically better off.\" Nearly half of the studies excluded patients who were diagnosed with or treated for mental illness, as well.\n\nMore than three-quarters of studies in the analysis were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the study points out. Other research has shown that industry-funded studies tend to produce better outcomes across a variety of fields.\n\nIn recent years, pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for aggressively marketing opioids to doctors. Leading up to the early 2000s, opioids were seen as a wonder drug , and doctors were urged to treat pain more aggressively. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in an open letter that doctors were taught that these medications were not addictive if patients were in \"legitimate pain.\" Multiple studies have shown this to be false.\n\n2013 study estimated that one in five patients who see a doctor for acute or chronic noncancer pain get prescribed opioids.\n\nAnother study last year supported a push by the CDC and other health experts to taper chronic pain patients off opioids when possible, saying they may have a better quality of life without them. But Cheng says this should be done carefully and may not work immediately for all patients, adding, \"I have seen many patients abandoned by their physicians, and they cannot find the people to manage their pain.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAccording to Cheng, alternative treatments that may be effective -- such as physical and cognitive behavioral therapies -- can also be out of reach for many patients, in some cases because insurance doesn't reimburse these services.\n\nHowever, despite gaps in knowledge of treating chronic pain, experts say opioids are part of that arsenal -- even if they come with risks and benefits that need to be better understood.\n\n\"For individuals who are suffering with unrelenting chronic pain every day of their lives, if they've tried other alternatives that haven't worked, they may in some cases decide they still want to embark on a trial of [opioid] therapy,\" Busse said, \"and now they have the evidence to understand what their chances are of achieving meaningful improvement.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Gatwick Airport: Drone sightings cause delays", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-46623754", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Passengers stranded at Gatwick waited for updates on their travel options\n\nThousands of passengers at one of the UK's busiest airports are experiencing flight disruption after drones were seen over the airfield.\n\nGatwick's runway remains closed after two of the devices were seen nearby.\n\nAbout 10,000 passengers were affected as flights were unable to take off and incoming planes were redirected -

The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible \u00a330,000 salary threshold for skilled workers.\n\nBut it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial.\n\nThe document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a \"reliance\" on such staff from the EU and require a \"period of time\" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement.\n\nBut the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other \"low-risk\" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap.\n\nIt raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers.\n\nNo cap on high-skilled workers\n\nThe White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond.\n\nIt accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using \"Tier 2\" visas.\n\nTier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors.\n\nThere will be a consultation about the salary threshold of \u00a330,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members.\n\nThe \u00a330,000 minimum earnings rule already applies to non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU.\n\nExtending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned.\n\nNHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: \"We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay.\n\n\"You have got starting salaries for nurses at \u00a323,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at \u00a327,000, healthcare assistants at \u00a317,000, all coming in way below that \u00a330,000 cap.\n\n\"It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay.

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km).

It's one of the region's big challenges,\" Cholewinski told Al Jazeera.\n\n170609141743286\n\n\"There's a lot of rhetoric on nationalisation [in for example Saudi Arabia's] Vision 2030 agenda. But in practice, this is going extremely slowly.\"\n\nAl Jazeera contacted the UN missions of all six Gulf states by email and telephone over the course of several days, but was not able to get a comment on this issue.\n\nWhile each Gulf nation faces different challenges when it comes to nationalisation, many Gulf citizens loathe taking jobs in private companies, which cannot compete with the pension plans, generous holidays and shorter working hours in the cushy jobs-for-life enjoyed by civil servants.\n\nThis can lead to odd distortions. A visitor to Dubai, the UAE's tourism hub, can spend their whole week-long vacation being served by migrant workers in shops, taxis and eateries, and the only Emirati they meet is a passport-stamping immigration clerk at the airport.\n\nLast month, the UAE launched it's so-called Citizen Redistribution Policy to temporarily shift civil servants into private sector jobs. It also rolled out training schemes for Emiratis and online recruitment tools.\n\nIn recent months, Riyadh has introduced rules requiring shops to have Saudis in at least 70 percent of sales jobs. Expat workers pay monthly fees for their spouses and children, employers pay similar penalties for foreign employees.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious Vision 2030 agenda aims to overhaul the Saudi economy by massively expanding the healthcare, education, recreation and tourism sectors and slash the high unemployment rates for young Saudis.\n\nJohn Shenton, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Building's Novus initiative, which supports construction jobs in Dubai, told Al Jazeera that Gulf nationalisation schemes were bearing fruit.\n\nIn some state-regulated sectors, such as banking, legal and financial services, the number of local staff has grown, Shenton said. \"If the goal is to get more Emiratis in the workforce then it's having some effect,\" said Shenton. \"However there are other factors that will mean that those efforts may not be reflected in the data.\"\n\nThese gains are dwarfed by the mass-recruitment of foreign construction workers to build the skyscrapers, malls and artificial islands for which the region is famous, he added.\n\n\"At a site level, the chaps in safety boots and hard hats will always be from the subcontinent or South Asia,\" Shenton said.\n\n\"At the engineering and supervisory level, the skill set required can't be satisfied by the number of local graduates. The volume of work being undertaken and the discreet programme dates associated with projects like Qatar 2022 necessitate our hosts resourcing from overseas.\"\n\nMelissa Roza, a headhunter at a Dubai-based recruitment firm, said nationalisation schemes had made gains in some white-collar jobs, but that state-set hiring quotas and penalty fees were also hurting these sectors.\n\nBanks in the UAE often prefer to pay fines for hiring foreigners than to cover the recruitment costs involved in hiring an Emirati, training them up and meeting their high salary expectations, she said.\n\nExecutives have also found workarounds by hiring migrants via outsourcing firms, which do not affect the quota count, added Roza, whose name was changed so she could talk frankly on a hot-button issue.\n\nFollow James Reinl on Twitter: @jamesreinl"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "DR Congo elections: Sunday voting may be delayed", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/dr-congo-elections-sunday-voting-delayed-181220080334529.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "An official from the electoral commission in the Democratic Republic of Congo says Sunday's elections might be delayed due to technical difficulties.\n\nEarlier, police fired tear gas at a crowd of rock-throwing supporters of opposition presidential candidate Martin Fayulu in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\nThe violence came after a ban by the city's governor on all political gatherings.\n\nAl Jazeera's Catherine Soi reports from Kinshasa."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Angry South Korean taxi drivers protest against ride-sharing app", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/angry-south-korean-taxi-drivers-protest-ride-sharing-app-181220061440259.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Tens of thousands of taxi drivers in South Korea have taken to the streets after walking off the job to protest against a commercial ride-sharing app that they say will destroy their jobs and threaten their livelihoods.\n\nThe rally on Thursday in the capital, Seoul, came days after the suicide of a taxi driver who set himself on fire in protest against the plans to introduce carpooling service Kakao Mobility, a unit of popular mobile messenger operator Kakao Corp.\n\nThe protesters, who wore black headbands and ribbons to mourn their 57-year-old colleague, chanted slogans such as \"combat illegal carpool\" as they rallied in front of the National Assembly.\n\n\"If the [Kakao Mobility] service is implemented, my income will shrink by half.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Wildlife Bridge to Reduce Car Collisions with Animals", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/wildlife-bridge-to-reduce-car-collisions-with-animals/4708631.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "A bridge over a busy interstate highway \u2014 not for cars or pedestrians, but for wildlife \u2014 is under construction in Washington state.

The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul\u2019s more rosy presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the already fragile diplomacy between Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.\n\nThe latest from North Korea comes as the United States and North Korea struggle over the sequencing of the denuclearization that Washington wants and the removal of international sanctions desired by Pyongyang. The statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency also raises credibility problems for the liberal South Korean government, which has continuously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nuclear weapons as Seoul tries to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue.\n\nThe North\u2019s comments may also be taken up as proof of what many outside skeptics have long said: that Kim will never voluntarily relinquish an arsenal he sees as a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurances the United States might provide. The statement suggests that North Korea will demand that the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, which would be a major sticking point to a potential disarmament deal.\n\nKim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. The leaders are trying to arrange another meeting for early next year.\n\n\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday\u2019s statement, the North made clear it\u2019s sticking to its traditional stance on denuclearization. It accused Washington of twisting what had been agreed on in Singapore and driving post-summit talks into an impasse.\n\n\n\n\u2018Study geography\u2019\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe United States removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to the North Korean statement.\n\n\u200bStalled talks\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reiteration of its long-standing position on denuclearization could prove to be a major setback for diplomacy, which was revived early this year following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests that left Kim and Trump spending most of 2017 exchanging personal insults and war threats. The statement could jeopardize Trump\u2019s plan to hold a second summit with Kim early next year as it could be difficult for the United States to push negotiations further if the North ties the future of its nukes to the U.S. military presence in the South, analysts said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim three times this year and lobbied hard for the Trump-Kim meeting, has said that Kim wasn\u2019t demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons. But Kim has never made such comments in public.\n\n\u201cThe blunt statement could be an indicator that the North has no intentions to return to the negotiation table anytime soon,\u201d said Shin Beomchul, a senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the North intends to keep its nukes and turn the diplomatic process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation with the United States, rather than a process where it unilaterally surrenders its program.\u201d\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.\n\n\n\nThe North Korean statement came a day after Stephen Biegun, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy on North Korea, told reporters in South Korea that Washington was reviewing easing travel restrictions on North Korea to facilitate humanitarian shipments to help resolve the impasse in nuclear negotiations."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "'A Moral Disaster': AP Reveals Scope of Migrant Kids Program", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-camps-for-children/4708729.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Decades after the U.S. stopped institutionalizing kids because large and crowded orphanages were causing lasting trauma, it is happening again. The federal government has placed most of the 14,300 migrant toddlers, children and teens in its care in detention centers and residential facilities packed with hundreds, or thousands, of children.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, some 5,400 detained migrant children in the U.S. are sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children. Some 9,800 are in facilities with 100-plus total kids, according to confidential government data obtained and cross-checked by The Associated Press.\n\nThat's a huge shift from just three months after President Donald Trump took office, when the same federal program had 2,720 migrant youth in its care; most were in shelters with a few dozen kids or in foster programs. Some of the children may be released sooner than anticipated, because this week the administration ended a portion of its strict screening policies that had slowed the placement of migrant kids with relatives in the U.S.\n\nUntil now, public information has been limited about the number of youths held at each facility overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, even for attorneys representing the kids. But the AP obtained data showing the number of children in individual detention centers, shelters and foster care programs for nearly every week over the past 20 months, revealing in detail the expanse of a program at the center of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nThe data shows the degree to which the government's approach to migrant youth has hardened, marking a new phase in a federal program originally intended to offer safe haven to vulnerable children fleeing danger across the globe. It's been taking at least twice as long, on average two months rather than one, for youth held inside the system to get out, in part because the Trump administration added more restrictive screening measures for parents and relatives who would take them in.\n\nThat changed Tuesday when the administration ended a policy requiring every adult in households where migrant children will live to provide the government with fingerprints. All still must submit to background checks, and parents themselves still need to be fingerprinted. Nonetheless, officials said they could now process some children more rapidly, and hoped to shorten shelter stays that had dragged on so long kids sometimes wondered if their parents had abandoned them for good.\n\n\"It's a pain we will never get through,'' said Cecilio Ramirez Castaneda, a Salvadoran whose 12-year-old son, Omar, was taken from him when they were apprehended in June under the administration's \"zero tolerance'' policy, which led to nearly 3,000 children being separated from their families. Omar feared his father had given up on him during the five months he spent in a Southwest Key shelter in Brownsville, Texas, with dozens of kids.\n\nRamirez was reunited with Omar last month only to learn that his son had been hospitalized for depression and medicated for unclear reasons and suffered a broken arm while in government custody.\n\n\"It's a system that causes irreparable damage,\"he said. \"My son says they would tell him that because he wasn't from here, he had no rights.\"\n\n\u200bExperts say the deep anxiety and distrust children suffer when they're institutionalized away from loved ones can cause long-lasting mental and physical health problems. It's dangerous for all but worse for younger children, those who stay more than a few days and those who are in larger facilities with less personal care.\n\n\"This is not a perplexing scientific puzzle. This is a moral disaster,'' said Dr. Jack Shonkoff, who heads Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child. \"There has to be some way to communicate, in unequivocal terms, that we are inflicting punishments on innocent children that will have lifelong consequences. No matter how a person feels about immigration policy, very few people hate children \u2014 and yet we are passively allowing bad things to happen to them.''\n\nAdministration officials said increased need has driven them to expand the number of beds available for migrant children from 6,500 last fall to 16,000 today. Mark Weber, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees ORR, said sheltering children in large facilities, while not preferable, is a better alternative than holding them for long periods at Border Patrol stations ill-suited to care for them.\n\n\"This is an amazing program with incredibly dedicated people who are working to take care of these kids,'' he said. \"There are a large number of children and it's a difficult situation, and we are just working hard to make sure they are taken care of and placed responsibly.''\n\nWeber confirmed a number of specific shelter populations from the data the AP obtained. To further verify the data, reporters contacted more than a dozen individual facilities that contract with ORR to house migrant children. Reporters also cross-referenced population numbers previously collected by AP and its partners.\n\nThe kids in government care range in age from toddlers to 17. The vast majority crossed the border without their parents, escaping violence and corruption in Central America, but some were separated from their families at the border earlier this year.\n\nThe care they receive varies greatly in the opaque network, which has encompassed 150 different programs over the last 20 months in 17 states. Some children live with foster families and are treated to Broadway shows, while others sleep in canvas tents exposed to the elements amid the Texas desert.\n\nThrough dozens of interviews and data analysis, AP found:\n\n\u2014 As of Dec. 17, some 9,800 children were in facilities housing more than 100 kids; 5,405 of those were in three facilities with more than 1,000 youths \u2014 two in Texas and one in Florida.\n\n\u2014 Texas had the most growth over the last 20 months in the number of kids under ORR custody. In April 2017, there were 1,368 migrant children in facilities or foster care in Texas. As of Dec. 17, the number was about 8,700.\n\n\u2014 New York had the second-highest number of children: 1,653, up from 210 in April 2017. Cayuga Centers grew from about 40 kids to close to 900; all are in foster homes.\n\n\u2014 The five largest providers, in order, are Austin, Texas-based Southwest Key; San Antonio-based BCFS Health and Human Services; Comprehensive Health Services Inc., based in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Cayuga Centers in Auburn, New York; and Chicago-based Heartland Alliance. Together they had about 11,600 children \u2014 or more than 80 percent of the 14,314 migrant youth in ORR custody as of Dec. 17.\n\n\u2014 The states with children in care are: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington state.\n\n\u200bKids continue to enter the system, though dozens of the care providers have been sued or disciplined before for mistreating children in their care. Now new litigation is piling up as attorneys fight to get migrant children released.\n\nStaff members at a Southwest Key shelter in Phoenix allegedly physically abused three children this year, leading to the closure of the shelter in October, federal officials said. And a lawsuit filed earlier this year alleged that Latino youths at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center in Virginia were beaten while handcuffed and locked up for long periods in solitary confinement, left nude and shivering in concrete cells.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and many experts warn against institutionalizing children in large groups. Dr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, said best practices minimize the number of children in any one shelter.\n\n\"Children are being treated as cogs in a machine, and their individual backgrounds, interests and unique identities are devalued as they are lost amongst the masses. This experience then becomes internalized, with significant psychological consequences,'' said Matlow, who recently met with migrant children in custody. \"There is no way in which a mass detention setting can replicate the experience and support that comes from family and community.''\n\nThe number of migrant children caught by immigration officials and then turned over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement has dropped under Trump: there were 49,100 in fiscal year 2018 compared to a high of 59,170 in fiscal year 2016, when a surge of youth crossing the border prompted the Obama administration to open emergency shelters at military bases. The average length of stay has increased, however, from about 34 days in January 2016 to around 60 days , according to government reports. In October, the average length of stay reached 89 days, according to data HHS provided to members of Congress, who shared it with AP."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Illinois AG: Catholic Church Failed to Report Hundreds of Sex Abuse Cases", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/illinois-sex-abuse/4708715.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan says her office has gotten at least 500 allegations of sex abuse by Catholic priests that dioceses across the state failed to publicly name.\n\nIn a new report Wednesday, Madigan excoriates church officials for failing to thoroughly investigate many of the allegations.\n\n\"The Catholic Church has failed in its moral obligation to provide survivors, parishioners, and the public a complete and accurate accounting of all sexually inappropriate behavior involving priests in Illinois,\" Madigan said.\n\nShe accuses the church of failing to determine if the conduct by the accused priests was ignored or covered up by their superiors.\n\nMadigan's report says in some cases, Illinois dioceses tried to discredit victims by turning the spotlight on their personal lives.\n\nChurch leaders, including Chicago Archbishop Cardinal Blase Cupich, say they regret any failures to address what he calls \"the scourge of clerical sexual abuse\" \u2014 and say some of the dioceses have long since instituted policies requiring the church to report such allegations to civil authorities, even if the accused priest is dead."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "South Korea Wants Smaller Military Drills with US", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-wants-smaller-military-drills-with-us/4708714.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "South Korea wants to hold smaller joint military drills with the United States next year, the defense ministry said Thursday, scaling back larger exercises as part of an effort to boost nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.\n\nThe allies have suspended a number of combined military exercises this year as tensions on the Korean Peninsula eased and Washington began talks to dismantle Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThe North has denounced the annual drills, which in the past involved hundreds of thousands of troops, warships and aircraft, as a \u201crehearsal for war.\u201d\n\n\u200bComputer-simulated drills\n\nWith nuclear talks under way, Seoul and Washington are discussing scaling back their regular field exercises, including Foal Eagle in early 2019, and hold two computer-simulated command post drills next year, the defense ministry said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last month the Foal Eagle exercise would be \u201creorganized a bit to keep it at a level that will not be harmful to diplomacy\u201d with North Korea.\n\nThe defense ministry delivered its plan to President Moon Jae-in Thursday as part of its annual policy briefing.\n\n\u201cJoint field exercises would take place all year-round after adjusting the scale,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe plan is also expected to affect a major summer exercise known as Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies suspended last year for the first time in 28 years.\n\nIn his opening remarks at the briefing, Moon said South Korea\u2019s strong defense had underpinned \u201ca new chapter of history of peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only provisional peace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to establish unwavering, lasting peace next year.\u201d\n\n\u200bImproved relations\n\nRelations improved this year between the Communist North and rich, democratic South, technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n\nThey have held three leaders\u2019 summits and signed a pact to establish a no-fly zone, remove landmines and guard posts near their heavily guarded border.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un also met U.S. President Donald Trump in June at a historic summit in Singapore.

[Former President Barack] Obama got a lot of applause when he withdrew from Iraq, but I have the same feeling about this that I did in Iraq \u2014 over time, this is not going to play well,\" Graham said. \"I saw the president's tweet.

That's when Dr. Albert Oh at Children's National Medical Center started planning Daniel's surgery. Oh says the ultrasound shows how severe a cleft is.\n\n\"You can also tell whether it's one-sided or both sided, and it also gives you a chance to look for other potential associated problems that these babies can have,\" Oh said.\n\nDaniel was also born with a small jaw -- a complication that can accompany a cleft palate or lip. Doctors created a hole from the front of his neck into his windpipe, so Daniel could breathe. The procedure is called a tracheostomy, or trach for short.\n\nNine in 10 children with a cleft lip or palate can die without surgery according to Dr. William McGee.

Also, McGee says Operation Smile is heavily involved in research.\n\n\"We know there's a genetic connection to it and we have now the largest collection of genetic specimens in the world,\" McGee said.\n\nThree siblings provided the clue for the gene that causes this condition.

He needs more surgeries to extend his jaw and fix his teeth. But there's a world of difference between the baby he was then, and the toddler he is today.\n\nRobilyn Truglio, Daniel's mother, reflects on these changes.\n\n\"He was getting sick a lot...frequent colds, and he got pneumonia a few times...and he needed a lot more care at that time. He needed a lot of suctioning through his trach, and with getting sick all the time, he was in the hospital a couple of times, but right now if he doesn't get sick, and if he does, it's resolved quickly.

The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul\u2019s more rosy presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the already fragile diplomacy between Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.\n\nThe latest from North Korea comes as the United States and North Korea struggle over the sequencing of the denuclearization that Washington wants and the removal of international sanctions desired by Pyongyang. The statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency also raises credibility problems for the liberal South Korean government, which has continuously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nuclear weapons as Seoul tries to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue.\n\nThe North\u2019s comments may also be taken up as proof of what many outside skeptics have long said: that Kim will never voluntarily relinquish an arsenal he sees as a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurances the United States might provide. The statement suggests that North Korea will demand that the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, which would be a major sticking point to a potential disarmament deal.\n\nKim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. The leaders are trying to arrange another meeting for early next year.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday\u2019s statement, the North made clear it\u2019s sticking to its traditional stance on denuclearization. It accused Washington of twisting what had been agreed on in Singapore and driving post-summit talks into an impasse.\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images File photo, taken on July 4, 2017, shows North Korea's test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 at an undisclosed location.\n\nThe United States removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to the North Korean statement.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reiteration of its long-standing position on denuclearization could prove to be a major setback for diplomacy, which was revived early this year following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests that left Kim and Trump spending most of 2017 exchanging personal insults and war threats. The statement could jeopardize Trump\u2019s plan to hold a second summit with Kim early next year as it could be difficult for the United States to push negotiations further if the North ties the future of its nukes to the U.S. military presence in the South, analysts said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim three times this year and lobbied hard for the Trump-Kim meeting, has said that Kim wasn\u2019t demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons. But Kim has never made such comments in public.\n\n\u201cThe blunt statement could be an indicator that the North has no intentions to return to the negotiation table anytime soon,\u201d said Shin Beomchul, a senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the North intends to keep its nukes and turn the diplomatic process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation with the United States, rather than a process where it unilaterally surrenders its program.\u201d\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Ambassador's Sudden Exit Amid Deportation Fight Was Totally Normal, State Department Says", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-osius-vietnam-state-department_us_5c1935bbe4b0432554c4ea60", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Osius, a career diplomat, disagreed with Trump administration policy.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.\n\nBehind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.\n\nThis is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.\n\nThe Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory at the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nChinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into \u201ca modern civilized\u201d world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.\n\nThe Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making \u201cmany untrue reports\u201d about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.\n\n\u201cThose reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,\u201d the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.\n\nHowever, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.\n\nPayment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said \u2014 barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees \u2014 or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there \u2014 are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nA former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.\n\n\u201cThe camp didn\u2019t pay any money, not a single cent,\u201d he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. \u201cEven for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.\u201d\n\nRushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 9, 2018, photo, Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp, holds up a phone showing a state television report about what Beijing calls \"vocational training centers\" for a photo in a restaurant in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Koksebek says that shortly before he was released from the camp in April, the camp's director strode into his class and told them they would soon be opening a new factory, and that detainees would be required to work and taught how to cook, sew, and repair cars.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.\n\nAbout two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.\n\nMen and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 6, 2018, photo, Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, the wife of a sheep herder, holds up a picture of her daughter, Rezila Nulale, and her graduation certificate, at an office of an advocacy group for ethnic Kazakhs born in China in Almaty, Kazakhstan on December 6, 2018. Kaliaskar says her daughter, a college graduate who had a job in advertising, was detained in an internment camp in China's far western region of Xinjiang and is now being forced to make clothes for no pay.\n\nAs China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a \u201cvocational skills education and training center\u201d in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\n\n\u201cTerrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,\u201d the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this \u201cglobal issue.\u201d\n\nWu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be \u201cunproblematic,\u201d he said, adding that the center is government-operated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making our contribution to eradicating poverty,\u201d Wu told the AP over the phone.\n\nThe 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.\n\nTrainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn\u2019t come here,\u201d one Uighur student said. \u201cThe party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.\u201d\n\nThe segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida\u2019s main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a child stands near a large screen showing photos of Chinese President Xi Jinping near a carpark in Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nPolice told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a \u201cmilitary facility.\u201d Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an \u201capparel employment training base.\u201d\n\nPosters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as \u201cLearn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person\u201d and \u201cNo need to pay tuition, find a job easily.\u201d\n\nNathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida\u2019s case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.\n\n\u201cThere are watchtowers throughout,\u201d Ruser said. \u201cThere are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.\u201d\n\nThe AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.\n\nAt least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.\n\nSprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp\u2019s sewing factory floor.\n\nShawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear\u2019s marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she\u2019s surprised the workers are \u201cfriendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Monday, Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a guard tower and barbed wire fences are seen around a facility in the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region.\n\nBadger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island\u2019s Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it\u2019s impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.\n\nAll the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.\n\nBadger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.\n\n\u201cWe will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,\u201d he said.\n\nBadger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.\n\nIn recent years, Badger imported sportswear \u2014 jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more \u2014 from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.\n\nThe U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention \u201ctraining\u201d there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,\u201d said Smith. \u201cU.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rushan Abbas, 51, of Herndon, Va., holds a photo of her sister, Gulshan Abbas, Monday, Dec. 17, 2018, in Washington. Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among the many Uighurs detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\nThe detention camp system is part of China\u2019s increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.\n\nNot all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn\u2019t have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,\u201d said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.\n\nInterviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director\u2019s words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to open a factory, you\u2019re going to work,\u201d Koksebek recalled him as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.\u201d\n\nThis fall, months after Koksebek\u2019s release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.\n\nIn October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that \u201csome trainees\u201d were nearly done with their \u201ccourses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,\u201d Zahir said.\n\nThe forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang\u2019s economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.\n\nA hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read \u201cHouse of Workers\u201d could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018, photo, residents pass by the entrance to the \"Hotan City apparel employment training base\" where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nMany of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder\u2019s wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.\n\nThen last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn\u2019t answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.\n\nFour months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for \u201cpolitical training.\u201d The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter\u2019s clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.\n\nLast month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar\u2019s brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.\n\nKaliaskar learned her daughter wasn\u2019t being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn\u2019t leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she\u2019s well educated and had a job,\u201d said Kaliaskar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this training?\u201d\n\nA former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.\n\nIf they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u2019d be taken straight back to the camps for \u201cfurther education.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory in the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nFarmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing\u2019s past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.\n\n\u201cI never asked the government to find work for my husband,\u201d said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.\n\nShe has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she\u2019s not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek\u2019s husband used to earn.\n\nSince her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a factory, but it\u2019s an excuse for detention. They don\u2019t have freedom, there\u2019s no time for him to talk with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they found a job for him.

The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seoul\u2019s more rosy presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the already fragile diplomacy between Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.\n\nThe latest from North Korea comes as the United States and North Korea struggle over the sequencing of the denuclearization that Washington wants and the removal of international sanctions desired by Pyongyang. The statement carried by the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency also raises credibility problems for the liberal South Korean government, which has continuously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in negotiating away his nuclear weapons as Seoul tries to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue.\n\nThe North\u2019s comments may also be taken up as proof of what many outside skeptics have long said: that Kim will never voluntarily relinquish an arsenal he sees as a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurances the United States might provide. The statement suggests that North Korea will demand that the United States withdraw or significantly reduce the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, which would be a major sticking point to a potential disarmament deal.\n\nKim and President Donald Trump met June 12 in Singapore where they issued a vague goal for the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. The leaders are trying to arrange another meeting for early next year.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday\u2019s statement, the North made clear it\u2019s sticking to its traditional stance on denuclearization. It accused Washington of twisting what had been agreed on in Singapore and driving post-summit talks into an impasse.\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images File photo, taken on July 4, 2017, shows North Korea's test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 at an undisclosed location.\n\nThe United States removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to the North Korean statement.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reiteration of its long-standing position on denuclearization could prove to be a major setback for diplomacy, which was revived early this year following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests that left Kim and Trump spending most of 2017 exchanging personal insults and war threats. The statement could jeopardize Trump\u2019s plan to hold a second summit with Kim early next year as it could be difficult for the United States to push negotiations further if the North ties the future of its nukes to the U.S. military presence in the South, analysts said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim three times this year and lobbied hard for the Trump-Kim meeting, has said that Kim wasn\u2019t demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons. But Kim has never made such comments in public.\n\n\u201cThe blunt statement could be an indicator that the North has no intentions to return to the negotiation table anytime soon,\u201d said Shin Beomchul, a senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the North intends to keep its nukes and turn the diplomatic process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation with the United States, rather than a process where it unilaterally surrenders its program.\u201d\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Senate Unanimously Approves Bill To Make Lynching A Federal Crime", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lynching-federal-hate-crime_us_5c1b0e46e4b05c88b6f4a952", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "After almost a century of attempts to outlaw lynching nationally, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved legislation Wednesday that would make the act a federal hate crime.\n\nThe Justice for Victims of Lynching Act was sponsored by the Senate\u2019s three African-American members: Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.).

Paul Ryan delivers a farewell address at the Library of Congress in Washington on Dec. 19. Retiring after three years as speaker of the House, he repeated calls he has made for reform on debt, immigration and poverty.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Paul Ryan was furious.\n\nHe\u2019d been caught in a trap \u2015 lured into an auditorium by the promise of a speech about fiscal responsibility. Instead, President Barack Obama was lecturing the crowd about why it would be wrong to balance the budget by impoverishing old people. Obama didn\u2019t mention Ryan\u2019s name, but in Ryan\u2019s mind, the president might as well have addressed the speech to him.\n\nEverybody could see Ryan, just sitting there in the front row of an auditorium at George Washington University. One of his colleagues leaned over and asked if they should leave. No, Ryan said. They should stay; they were being watched. He had noticed a photographer with a camera mounted on a unipod, its long lens pointed straight at him. He sat rigidly in his chair.\n\nIt had all been a setup.\n\nTo Ryan, Obama\u2019s breach of decorum in April 2011 \u2015 in which he lightly criticized Ryan\u2019s budget while calling for entitlement reform himself \u2015 was Exhibit A in the case against Obama. According to Ryan, it meant Obama was unwilling to work across party lines to solve policy problems. It was an affront to fiscal responsibility and the Beltway Norms. A stunning contrast between the two men \u2015 one a partisan politician and the other a serious policy wonk.\n\n\u201cHis false attacks were offensive, even by the low standards for discourse and civility in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Ryan recalled in his 2014 book, in which he devoted eight pages to the incident.\n\nThe story has been retold in at least three books, with Ryan denouncing Obama\u2019s \u201cdemagoguery\u201d each time.\n\nIn retrospect, of course, in light of the current president\u2019s constant depredations \u2015 against civility, against the discourse, even against Ryan himself \u2015 Obama\u2019s speech was the political equivalent of using the wrong fork at a dinner party. The idea that the speech amounted to some great offense, by the standard Ryan has set not even six years later, is patently absurd.\n\nWhereas Obama didn\u2019t even mention Ryan by name in the infamous speech, President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Ryan directly, calling the House speaker \u201cweak and ineffective\u201d and a \u201cBoy Scout\u201d and saying he \u201cknows nothing,\u201d though Trump has more recently said he has come to appreciate Ryan \u201clike a fine wine.\u201d\n\n(Reminder: Trump doesn\u2019t drink.)\n\nWhile Ryan made a habit of bashing Obama \u2015 his reaction to Obama\u2019s last State of the Union address was to say Obama \u201cdegrades the presidency\u201d because Obama warned against then-candidate Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric \u2015 he has famously stood by Trump, greeting the president\u2019s near-daily embarrassments with cheery unawareness. Even when Ryan couldn\u2019t avoid Trump\u2019s scandals, he continued to praise Trump as \u201cthoughtful,\u201d \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201cexquisite.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the fiction that Ryan chooses to live in \u2015 a fiction in which Trump is restoring honor to the presidency and his behavior is to be downplayed, dismissed or outright ignored. And it\u2019s that blithe fiction, contrasted with our graphic, Trump-y reality, for which Ryan should be remembered.\n\nWhen Ryan leaves office in January, he will not have balanced the budget or fixed Congress or solved poverty or left our politics smarter or less divided. Instead, during his three-year tenure as speaker, the deficit has nearly doubled. The procedural problems in Congress are more daunting. Poverty isn\u2019t much different. And our politics are more partisan, less ideological, than maybe ever before.\n\nThe version of Paul Ryan that he and his staff tried to project for years \u2015 the image of a squeaky-clean numbers guy, rolling up his sleeves, solving tough policy problems \u2015 is a sham. According to a number of polls, many people now recognize him as a monumental partisan, a politician who won a reputation as a wonk because he was able to memorize a few lines from an actuarial table and then promptly ignore his own pledges to balance the budget when he had the chance. Ryan is the man who, perhaps more than anybody else, normalized Trump, who led reluctant Republicans back to Trump, who went along with the president even when he knew he shouldn\u2019t and traded his dignity for a tax cut.\n\nTax Cuts!\n\nThis week, Ryan and his office released a six-part video series on his decades-long quest to reform the tax code. But he didn\u2019t reform our tax code. When all the new guidance is issued, the 40,000-page tax code is likely to be even longer. He simply cut taxes \u2015 or, at least, he didn\u2019t stand in the way.\n\nIt turned out that cutting taxes by $1.5 trillion wasn\u2019t all that hard, as long as \u201cconservatives\u201d were on board with not paying for tax cuts. The grand irony of \u201ctax reform\u201d is that, for all the credit Ryan and his staff try to give him for the bill, the final legislation was closer to the principles that Freedom Caucus leaders like Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) laid out: a corporate rate at 20 percent, a bigger standard deduction and cuts that weren\u2019t paid for.\n\nRyan wanted a bill that was at least mostly revenue-neutral (it ended up costing more than a trillion dollars over 10 years), that would allow individuals to fill out their tax returns on a postcard (that didn\u2019t happen) and that had a corporate rate closer to 25 percent (it ended up at 21 percent).\n\nHe almost blew up the tax bill by insisting on a border adjustment tax to offset some of the cuts. It wasn\u2019t until he gave up on the BAT \u2015 a tarifflike tax that would have increased prices on imports and also, theoretically, increased the value of the dollar \u2015 that tax reform became a reality.\n\nAnd it was the Senate that played the biggest role in shaping the tax bill, with Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) deciding how much debt was acceptable to rack up. In conference, when differences between the two chambers\u2019 versions are resolved, legislators took the Senate version on a number of important provisions \u2015 pass-through income, international regulations, the child tax credit \u2015 and ditched a bunch of politically perilous, revenue-raising ideas from the House, like ending deductions on medical expenses and student loans.\n\nRyan\u2019s signature achievement of tax reform is neither actually his nor actually an achievement. Yes, the economy is doing well. But there was low unemployment and economic growth before the tax cuts. A year after it was enacted, the bill remains unpopular. The stock market has basically run sideways since the GOP\u2019s tax bill was enacted \u2015 the S&P 500 is down on the year \u2015 and wages for workers have barely grown.\n\nThe tax cuts were supposed to spur investment and put more money in everyone\u2019s pocket. Instead, they prompted a small round of one-time bonuses, a huge number of stock buybacks and deficits that will persist for decades.\n\nAnd yet, in true Ryan form, he seeks out another round of feting, when most politicians would have the self-awareness to quietly exit out the back.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that he will hand over the speaker\u2019s gavel to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a partial government shutdown, because he and other Republicans refuse to level with Trump and tell him he\u2019s not getting his border wall. A short-term funding bill, looking more likely by the hour, would be more of the same avoidance. It would be stage one in the grieving process.\n\nBut denial has been one of Ryan\u2019s favorite strategies with Trump. Ryan has been satisfied to try to influence government and the president at the periphery. When Ryan became aware recently that there were more than 10,000 unused work visas, he pushed through legislation making sure Irish nationals would have access to those visas.\n\nWhen Trump said he might try to end birthright citizenship, Ryan suggested such a move would have to come from Congress, which prompted Trump to say that Ryan \u201cknows nothing\u201d about the issue and should be focused on holding the GOP majority \u2015 something Ryan wasn\u2019t able to do. The speaker oversaw the largest Republican losses in 44 years.\n\nRyan never responded to Trump\u2019s diss. The direct insults from Trump never seemed to rankle Ryan the same way Obama\u2019s indirect slights appeared to bother him.\n\nA simple truth of Ryan\u2019s career is that he spent every day fighting to help people who didn\u2019t need help. It was always about cutting taxes, and as big of a game as he talked on the debt, when he had the chance to do something about entitlements or spending, he cowered from the challenge.\n\nAs part of his farewell tour, he said in November that his two biggest regrets were failing to tackle immigration reform and not addressing the growing national debt. He also theorized that history would be kind to his speakership and the GOP Congress he ruled over, partly because of the tax cuts that passed under his watch.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that the tax cuts are getting more popular or becoming more effective, and there\u2019s no indication that Republicans are getting more serious about debt.\n\nThe Debt\n\nTo take the issue of debt seriously for a moment \u2015 something Republicans (and Democrats) don\u2019t do \u2015 we\u2019ve incurred enough debt at this point that the interest payments on our $21 trillion hole will ensure that we never see a balanced budget again without massive spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nFor Ryan, this might not be much of a contradiction. Cutting taxes is core to the Republican mission, while the debt is a political tool used to bash Democrats and to justify welfare cuts. The media and the public just fell for the GOP ruse.\n\n\u201cHistory will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generation\u2019s defining challenge, chose to duck and run,\u201d Ryan said of Obama after the president once again criticized the House GOP budget in 2012.\n\nBut when it was his party controlling Congress and the White House, during a time of economic prosperity, when Washington has traditionally looked to realign the federal budget, Ryan didn\u2019t shrink the deficit; he nearly doubled it, through a combination of spending increases and tax cuts. Legislation enacted since Trump took office will add $2.7 trillion to the national debt. The tax cuts and spending bills enacted in fiscal 2018 alone will widen 2019\u2019s deficit by $445 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the yearly deficit, which was $585 billion in fiscal 2016 \u2015 the year Ryan took the speakership \u2015 will be roughly $1 trillion when he leaves office.\n\nWar\n\nWhen Ryan announced his retirement from Congress in April, he cheered the spending increases for the military that Republicans locked into spending agreements. Those Pentagon plus-ups, paired with domestic spending increases to appease Democrats, have ballooned the deficit.\n\nIn 2011, conservatives in Congress refused to go along with increases to spending or the debt ceiling without a plan to restrain the deficit. What they came up with was the Budget Control Act, which set caps for defense and nondefense spending for the next 10 years. Except lawmakers have refused to live by those caps. Congress has honored the spending limits exactly zero times. The Pentagon particularly seems unwilling to abide by the limits. And Republicans like Ryan cheer on the military budget increases, even as the Pentagon has never completed an audit.\n\nRyan entered the speakership by saying he wanted to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. We\u2019ve justified more than three dozen military operations in more than a dozen countries using the overly broad authorization from 2001.\n\n\u201cIt would be a good sign for American foreign policy to have a new one updating our AUMF,\u201d Ryan said in December 2015.\n\nBut he spent the next three years blocking a new AUMF, saying he wouldn\u2019t allow debate on any bill that would restrict the ability of the military to fight.\n\nJust last week, Ryan attached special instructions to a rule for the farm bill that would waive provisions in the War Powers Resolution so he could block debate on a resolution about U.S. support for a war in Yemen \u2015 a war that has created what the United Nations called \u201cthe worst man-made humanitarian crisis of our time.\u201d An estimated 85,000 Yemeni children have died from starvation associated with the war, and an additional 17 million Yemenis are at risk of malnutrition.\n\nRegular Order!\n\nRyan\u2019s efforts to block debate on war are entirely consistent with his actions as speaker but totally inconsistent with his message as he took the gavel. He said he wanted to return to regular order, that he wanted to allow debate on bills and amendments on the House floor.\n\nInstead, there was one open rule during the entirety of his speakership, meaning there was only one bill to which members could offer any amendment they wanted, as long as it pertained to the bill and wasn\u2019t written on the fly. He oversaw what may go down as the most closed Congress of all time. And rather than address immigration or entitlement reform or war or guns or children being separated from their parents at the border or a bill protecting Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Ryan was satisfied to use the House to pass uncontroversial bills renaming post offices or selling federal land to pump up the number of bills the House passed and Trump signed.\n\nThe Republican calls to read the bill \u2015 calls that helped propel them to the majority in 2010 \u2015 have been replaced with Ryan ramming through a 2,232-page bill funding the government 17 hours after leaders released the text. Amazingly, on the same day the House passed that bill, he said he had done \u201ca phenomenal job\u201d restoring regular order.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan took to the Great Hall in the Library of Congress for yet another goodbye speech. It was almost exactly three years since Ryan delivered a speech in that room at the beginning of his speakership. But what was supposed to be a farewell was really more of the same calls he made in the past for reform \u2015 on debt, on immigration and on poverty.\n\nAs Vox recently remarked in a headline, \u201cPaul Ryan really wishes the House speaker would fix immigration and the debt.\u201d Ryan is the speaker who didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had the power to do things, that he could do more than cut taxes and that achieving results would take more than grandiose speeches echoing hollowly through the Great Hall in the Library of Congress.\n\nPoverty\n\nOne particular issue that Ryan simply seemed to give up on was poverty.\n\nAfter the 2012 presidential election, when he was mocked for a soup kitchen photo op in which he seemed to be washing pots and pans that were already clean, Ryan launched himself into what he called a \u201cpoverty tour.\u201d He traveled the country visiting nonprofit organizations that sought to rehabilitate poor people with criminal histories or drug problems.\n\nHe came up with a bunch of proposals that were basically a rebranding of welfare cuts, and he built his case for cutting assistance to the poor on a false claim: that the War on Poverty had failed.\n\nThat is all consistent with the Ryan we\u2019ve all come to know. But one of the reasons he was able to con so many people for so long was that he wasn\u2019t incapable of coming up with an interesting idea from time to time. He had elements of self-reflection and regret, like when he said in early 2016 that it was wrong of him to have used the frame \u201cmakers and takers.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, instead of simply claiming that government programs that help poor people actually make them worse off \u2015 and that therefore antipoverty spending should be cut \u2015 Ryan did something different. He said the government should hire case managers who could work with poor people to create a \u201ccustomized life plan to provide a structured roadmap out of poverty.\u201d\n\nCase management was the centerpiece of his proposal to reform the federal government\u2019s antipoverty programs into an \u201copportunity grant.\u201d The proposal and the poverty tour figured prominently in his 2014 book, \u201cThe Way Forward,\u201d which is the type of book politicians write when they\u2019re thinking about running for president. He portrayed poverty policy as a consistent area of concern during his career, ever since his days working as an aide to Jack Kemp, a former congressman who called himself a \u201cbleeding-heart conservative.\u201d\n\nBut commentators from both sides thought the idea of a \u201ccustomized life plan\u201d was weird. And so Ryan backed away. \u201cWe\u2019re saying this is one of the things we recommend, but give the states the ability to try other ideas,\u201d he told HuffPost in 2014.\n\nAfter he became speaker and Trump became president, Ryan had a chance to make his poverty agenda a reality. Instead, he used his time and political capital trying to take health care from millions of poor people \u2015 remember, the House GOP health care plan included $834 billion in cuts to Medicaid \u2015 and then passing a tax cut. He gave up on poverty.\n\nHe said Wednesday that solving poverty will require \u201ca great rethinking of how we help the most vulnerable among us.\u201d And without a shred of self-awareness or irony, he urged his Republican colleagues to not \u201clet this issue drift from your consciousness.\u201d\n\nThe Myth Of Paul Ryan\n\nThe sincerity with which Paul Ryan believed in the myth of Paul Ryan was perhaps why it was so effective. During his speech Wednesday, he decried how outrage had become a \u201cbrand,\u201d how we all needed to disregard \u201cthe noise.\u201d\n\nBut what Ryan deems noise and what he thinks warrants outrage have a distinctly partisan slant. When Trump tweeted that he was considering revoking the security clearances of his political enemies, Ryan said Trump was \u201cjust trolling.\u201d When Trump attacks fellow Republicans or when he lies outright or suggests breaking into the Democratic National Committee, that\u2019s just to be ignored.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff you see on a daily basis on Twitter this and Twitter that \u2014 forget about it,\u201d Ryan said in October 2017.\n\nExcept that was not how Ryan treated Obama. Ryan said Obama was the nation\u2019s worst president. Ryan relentlessly attacked Obama and took horrible offense during the 2011 speech in which Obama agreed that the nation needed to tackle entitlements.\n\nIn Bob Woodward\u2019s telling, \u201cRyan felt betrayed. He\u2019d expected an olive branch. What he got was the finger.\u201d\n\nWhat was the appalling criticism that Obama had made?\n\nOne of the most egregious insults was that Obama noted Ryan\u2019s budget would transfer Medicare to a voucher system. \u201cAnd if that voucher isn\u2019t worth enough to buy the insurance that\u2019s available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck \u2014 you\u2019re on your own,\u201d Obama said.\n\nAnd how did the Congressional Budget Office describe Ryan\u2019s budget? \u201cUnder the proposal, most elderly people who would be entitled to premium support payments would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Dons Santa Hat To Surprise Hospitalized Kids With Gifts", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-santa-childrens-hospital_us_5c1ac857e4b05c88b6f48636", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "The former president, whose love of interacting with kids was pretty obvious throughout his time in office, brought jigsaw puzzles, toy car sets, remote-control cars, glittery nail polish and other gifts to the Washington, D.C., hospital, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThank you @BarackObama for making our patients\u2019 day so much brighter.

But his refusal to take a stand against President Donald Trump \u2015 even in the commander in chief\u2019s darkest moments \u2015 is a legacy he won\u2019t soon shake.\n\nAs Ryan pats himself on the back for a job well done during his final weeks in office, an authoritarian-loving habitual liar sits behind the Resolute Desk with little rebuff from his party\u2019s leaders.\n\nHere are the some of Ryan\u2019s most spineless moments in the Trump era:\n\nCharlottesville\n\nTrump drew heated bipartisan backlash in August 2017 for his reaction to the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he initially defended attendees as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2015 on many sides,\u201d the president had said, referring to neo-Nazis and anti-racist counterprotesters alike.\n\nDays later, Ryan posted a searing condemnation of white supremacy on Facebook, though his post failed to call out the president\u2019s initial defense of white nationalist rallygoers.\n\n\u201cThe immediate condemnations from left, right and center affirmed that there is no confusion about right and wrong here,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cThere are no sides. There is no other argument. We will not tolerate this hateful ideology in our society.\u201d\n\nOpportunities for Ryan to publicly condemn Trump\u2019s most controversial comments on race are boundless but rarely seized. Asked in October 2017 about Trump\u2019s approach to race relations in the U.S., Ryan told CBS\u2019 John Dickerson that he felt the president meant well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s learning,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know his heart is in the right place.\u201d\n\nAfter #Charlottesville, @SpeakerRyan said @realDonaldTrump heart is \"in the right place\" when he talks about race issues: pic.twitter.com/ETSvYrO5ya \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 1, 2017\n\n\u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 Tape\n\nWhat most people assumed would be a fatal blow to then-candidate Trump\u2019s presidential bid appeared to be nothing more than a passing disturbance to Ryan.\n\nThe infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d audio recording, first published by The Washington Post and NBC News in October 2016, featured Trump bragging to then-host Billy Bush in 2005 about sexually assaulting women.\n\n\u201cI did try and fuck her,\u201d Trump can be heard saying on the video in reference to an unnamed woman. \u201cYou know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful \u2015 I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re a star they let you do it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can do anything. ... Grab them by the pussy.

And weeks after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape first made headlines, Ryan made it crystal clear just how affected he was by the comments by announcing that he had cast his ballot for Trump during early voting.\n\n\u201cWe need to support our entire Republican ticket,\u201d Ryan said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n.@SpeakerRyan: I voted for Donald Trump last week in early voting. pic.twitter.com/5TupgISFSO \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) November 1, 2016\n\nJames Comey\n\nRyan shamelessly defended Trump\u2019s alleged request of then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn by claiming the new president simply hadn\u2019t gotten his feet wet in the job yet.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s new at this,\u201d Ryan told reporters in June 2017. \u201cHe\u2019s new to government.

It has four primary goals: identifying lead-exposed children, reducing children\u2019s exposure to lead sources, communicating more effectively with stakeholders, and conducting research to inform these efforts.\n\n\u201cLead exposure is a calamity that disproportionately harms children in low-income communities. All Americans, regardless of their age, race, income or home address, deserve an opportunity to live in safe and healthy environments,\u201d Wheeler, co-chair of the President\u2019s Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe task force was established by executive order in 1997 and comprises 17 federal departments and offices, including the EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services. Wheeler said the plan includes specific action targeting lead in paint, drinking water, contaminated soil and consumer products before it presents a \u201cserious and urgent threat\u201d to children.\n\nBut childhood lead experts and advocates who reviewed the action plan said it falls far short of what\u2019s needed to eliminate the risk of childhood lead exposure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant step backward in progress to end lead poisoning for children in the United States,\u201d said attorney and health justice scholar Emily Benfer, a visiting associate clinical professor of law at Columbia University Law School who directs the health justice advocacy clinic.\n\nThis task force is talking about simply reducing exposure and not taking any concrete steps to actually make that happen. And without a dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s really just talk. Emily Benfer, Columbia University Law School\n\nThe task force\u2019s 2016 report included primary prevention, environmental justice, and the elimination of lead poisoning, but none of those themes are included in the current action plan, Benfer said, noting it doesn\u2019t use the word \u201celiminate\u201d at all.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, the task force said that the goal was to eliminate lead poisoning and to realize environmental justice especially for high-risk communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis task force is talking about simply reducing exposure and not taking any concrete steps to actually make that happen. And without a dedicated funding stream, it\u2019s really just talk.\u201d\n\nBenfer is particularly concerned that the plan often mentions the task force\u2019s intent to evaluate or re-evaluate lead contamination issues that have already been studied, researched and widely understood in the scientific community as being harmful to human health.\n\nFor example, the dangers of lead in aviation fuel, the single largest source of lead in the air, said Benfer, is an issue that requires action, not more evaluation, to protect children in low-income communities who are most affected by ambient air pollution.\n\nThe action plan even recommends more evaluation of the blood lead reference level at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends public health intervention for children. The CDC has already concluded that no level of lead in children is safe, and may reduce the reference level from 5 to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter based on scientific recommendations.\n\n\u201cSo while they\u2019re busy considering and exploring \u2014 those are the themes of the report \u2014 how many millions more children are going to suffer from the permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning?\u201d Benfer asked.\n\n\u201cThis really doesn\u2019t advance lead poisoning prevention in any way,\u201d she added.\n\nTAE-GYUN KIM/ASSOCIATED PRESS An empty playground at Carrie Gosch Elementary School, which was closed due to lead contamination near the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana. The town's mayor ordered the evacuation of the housing complex because of severe lead contamination, forcing more than 1,000 people from their homes.\n\nRuth Ann Norton, president and chief executive officer of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative in Baltimore, commended the task force for producing a comprehensive report and for emphasizing the urgency of taking action to address what she described as one of the most tragic and costly environmental diseases in the United States.\n\nBut the plan is too broad, she said, and lacks details on one of the most important questions to implement the strategy: funding.\n\n\u201cThey clearly support the fact that lead is an entirely preventable and winnable issue ... but it does not address the most urgent, pressing need, which is the capital investment to eliminate this issue,\u201d Norton told HuffPost.\n\nThe action plan is not a budget document and notes that all of its activities are \u201csubject to budgetary constraints, interagency processes, stakeholder input and other approvals.\u201d This includes how the Trump administration weighs priorities and available resources, and how Congress appropriates funding, it explains.\n\nAlthough blood lead levels in U.S. children have dropped dramatically in the last 30 years, lead continues to plague communities across the country, particularly low-income neighborhoods. Approximately half a million U.S. children in the United States have blood lead levels above the level at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends intervention.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, Erik Olson, senior director of health and food for the international nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, also criticized the action plan for failing to commit to regulatory or enforcement action.\n\n\u201cLead is one of our most toxic pollutants, and it\u2019s in our air, waters and lands. And children are our most vulnerable population. Given this administration\u2019s abysmal track record on protecting public health, we remain skeptical,\u201d Olson said in a statement from NRDC.\n\nThe plan outlines that the EPA will consider revisions to lead dust hazard standards from paint, as appropriate. But Olson points out that the agency is under a court order to strengthen outdated lead hazard standards by July 2019.\n\n\u201c\u2018Considering\u2019 complying with a court order doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d wrote Olson.\n\nHe noted that the EPA\u2019s July 2018 proposal on lead paint dust hazard standards did tighten the standards, but not as much as public health experts have recommended.\n\n'Considering\u2019 complying with a court order doesn\u2019t cut it. Erik Olson, Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nOlson also took issue with the types of stakeholders involved in the process to revise the EPA\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, which the agency had proposed to strengthen by December 2017, then delayed to spring 2019.\n\nThe rule, which hasn\u2019t been updated in more than two decades, establishes the guidelines for how local jurisdictions must manage their water systems to reduce lead and copper pipe contamination.\n\nThe task force says it plans to move forward on the rule with input from \u201cfrom state, tribal, and local partners.\u201d But Olson points out that public health advocates, environmental groups and others aren\u2019t explicitly mentioned.\n\nExperts also recommend primary prevention to eliminate environmental hazards at the source. The task force\u2019s goals, however, place an emphasis on identifying lead-exposed children, which is the opposite of primary prevention, said Benfer.\n\n\u201cThey talk about the need to facilitate follow-up blood lead level testing and monitoring but they disregard the fact that the majority of states require zero intervention until lead levels are past 10, 15, 20 even 45 micrograms per deciliter,\u201d said Benfer. \u201cSo without this widespread effort to really provide guidance with the goal of primary prevention, we\u2019re going to continue placing children in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nNorton, with the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative in Maryland, says the elimination of lead poisoning through primary prevention, universal blood testing and other concrete steps is achievable in five years but would require an investment of $12.5 billion over a five-year period. Her organization published a 2016 report that outlines a strategy to marshal the financial resources to end childhood lead exposure.\n\nIn the long run, spending this money to prevent lead exposure will save the nation more than $250 billion over five years, Norton said, noting that the United States spends approximately $50 billion every year on the avoidable cost of treating hundreds of thousands of poisoned and lead-exposed children.\n\n\u201cThe realities are that we are paying a price for a toxic legacy that has impaired the opportunities of American children for generations, and most especially African-American children, at an alarming and unacceptable rate and continues to do so,\u201d Norton said.\n\nUltimately, health justice scholars such as Benfer say the task force has ignored the best practice recommendations and advice of experts, advocates and affected community members.\n\n\u201cThe task force had an unparalleled opportunity to lead a coordinated national effort to eliminate lead poisoning and protect future generations from the neurotoxin, and it punted,\u201d said Benfer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Obamacare Enrollment Down Slightly This Year", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-enrollment-down-slightly-this-year_us_5c1aaee2e4b05c88b6f46778", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Health insurance enrollment on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges dipped slightly this year, according to preliminary data released by the federal government Wednesday.\n\nIn the 39 states where consumers buy coverage via the federally operated HealthCare.gov, 8.5 million people enrolled into private health insurance policies for next year during the open enrollment period that ran from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced in a press release. That\u2019s 288,760, or 3 percent, fewer than signed up from those states during enrollment a year ago. The data from last year include some sign-ups that were tabulated during the week after open enrollment ended, while the new figures do not.\n\nNotably, sign-ups for people new to the exchanges fell more significantly compared to the prior enrollment period. Just over 2 million new customers enrolled this year, compared to almost 2.5 million a year ago, an 18 percent decline.\n\nThese figures do not include enrollments from the 11 states plus the District of Columbia, which run their own health insurance exchanges. And sign-ups are ongoing in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia, which have later final deadlines than the 39 federal exchanges and the state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Idaho, Maryland, Vermont and Washington state.\n\nEarlier data from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services seemed to indicate a larger drop-off in enrollments might occur, but a late surge as the Dec. 15 deadline approached made up a significant amount of ground, even though the total failed to match last year\u2019s, which itself was a decline from previous years.\n\nDespite the small decline, these first results demonstrate the perhaps surprising resilience of the health insurance exchanges since the first open enrollment period began in the fall of 2013.\n\nThe Obamacare exchanges debuted with a nearly catastrophic failure of HealthCare.gov, and premiums were high and rose each year \u2015 sometimes by a great deal. Many major health insurance companies abandoned these markets after losing money. And the exchanges and the entire Affordable Care Act have been under sustained political assault by the Republican Party at the state and federal level.\n\nEarly evidence from some state-run exchanges, however, suggests that federal actions hampered enrollment.\n\nYet millions still continue to come to the exchanges to obtain health insurance. This speaks to the obvious demand for affordable and accessible health coverage. That\u2019s particularly true for people who aren\u2019t offered health benefits by their employers or who couldn\u2019t afford insurance prior to the creation of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credit subsidies for low- and middle-income households or were rejected by insurance companies because of pre-existing conditions before the ACA banned the practice.\n\nSince the beginning, more than 80 percent of exchange customers have been subsidized. This not only gives them access to insurance in the first place, but also shields them from annual premium increases, because the subsidies rise along with the prices. Those who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies, however, must bear the full cost of the insurance and might have been priced out of the market.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken numerous steps to undermine the program and reduce its effectiveness.\n\nThis year, the administration slashed the advertising budget for open enrollment by 90 percent, even though the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services possessed evidence that those cuts would lead to fewer sign-ups. The agency also cut the budget for in-person enrollment assistance by 40 percent. These spending reductions followed similar actions taken last year.\n\nLast year, Trump roiled the health insurance markets by halting payments to health insurance companies serving the poorest exchange customers, leading to significant premium increases above what the insurers would otherwise have instituted. Trump and the GOP Congress repealed the fines associated with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate, giving people one less reason to get covered.\n\nThe Trump administration also broadened the availability of other forms of health coverage this year that might have drawn away people who otherwise would have enrolled in coverage from an exchange.\n\nConsumers can now purchase so-called short-term, limited duration policies for a a full year. These plans are intended to provide coverage during gaps between other forms of coverage \u2015 like when a new job\u2019s benefits don\u2019t kick in right away \u2015 but the administration and health insurance carriers have promoted them as a substitute for comprehensive health insurance.\n\nThese policies, however, are not required to meet federal standards for benefits, and may not cover critical needs such as prescription drugs. Insurers offering these plans also are allowed to reject people with pre-existing conditions, which they aren\u2019t allowed to do for customers shopping for exchange coverage.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the Trump administration\u2019s changes to the health insurance market and its management of the exchanges isn\u2019t measurable from the available data, although a report issued after last year\u2019s sign-up campaign indicates they have had a negative effect on enrollment.\n\nEarly evidence from some state-run exchanges, however, suggests that federal actions hampered enrollment. The state-administered exchanges did not follow the Trump administration\u2019s lead in cutting outreach and enrollment activities."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Obamacare Is One Of The Best Tools We Have In Solving The Opioid Crisis", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-solving-opioid-crisis_us_5c191a49e4b02d2cae8da4d1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "After a federal judge ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, President Donald Trump enthusiastically praised the decision as \u201cGreat news for America!\u201d\n\nThe ruling will inevitably be appealed and most likely overturned. Should it stand, however, that \u201cgreat news\u201d would translate to more than 17 million Americans losing health care coverage and the uninsured rate rising by 50 percent, according to an Urban Institute analysis.\n\nWith the health care law temporarily in flux, it\u2019s worth revisiting an often-unacknowledged aspect of how the ACA helps underserved Americans: It\u2019s a key tool in addressing our nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about treating addiction as a public health issue, and bending the curve of the opioid epidemic, we must maintain the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Regina LaBelle, the former chief of staff at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Obama administration.\n\nIf we are serious about treating addiction as a public health issue, and bending the curve of the opioid epidemic, we must maintain the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion. Regina LaBelle, former chief of staff, White House Office of National Drug Control Policy\n\nIn addition to requiring that addiction treatment be on par with physical health insurance coverage, two specific parts of the ACA have made addiction treatments, such as medication-assisted treatment and inpatient and outpatient therapies, more accessible.\n\nFirst, the ACA guarantees health insurance coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cA person with a history of substance use cannot be denied health coverage,\u201d explained Leighton Ku, a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\nSecondly, the law allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26.\n\n\u201cAs we know, addiction is a disease of early onset, and the earlier we can intervene, the better,\u201d LaBelle said. \u201cThat\u2019s why allowing young people to stay on their parent\u2019s insurance is important.\u201d\n\nAnother critical tool, according to experts, is expanding Medicaid to all low-income adults under the ACA.\n\nAnd while conservatives have argued that expanding Medicaid made the opioid crisis worse, research published earlier this year comparing expansion states to non-expansion states debunked that claim.\n\nInstead, prescription fills for addiction medicine, combined with the opioid reversal antidote naloxone, significantly increased in expansion counties, indicating that more people were receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cThis supports the idea that Medicaid expansion has been beneficial in increasing the number of people receiving an important addiction treatment,\u201d Brendan Saloner, lead author of the study and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told HuffPost.\n\nThirty-six states, plus Washington D.C., had enacted the policy or were planning to do so as of December.\n\nIn addition to expanding addiction treatment, Saloner noted that expanding Medicaid shifted the burden of funding addiction treatment off of state and local budgets and onto the federal government, potentially freeing up funds in those states to improve the patchwork of treatment services they offer.\n\nThe expansion was also associated with a decrease in crime, he said, noting that in addition to health implications, addiction touches on areas such as public safety, child welfare and employment.\n\nMost of all, Saloner stressed that the opioid epidemic, which killed nearly 50,000 Americans in 2017, could have potentially been even worse."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Here's What You Need To Know About Facebook's Colossally Bad Year", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-2018-privacy-data_us_5c1a6812e4b01059bfc610e4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "In November, Facebook admitted that it hired a Republican opposition research firm to dig up dirt on billionaire philanthropist and prominent Democratic donor George Soros, a frequent target of anti-Semitic, right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nThe social media giant enlisted the help of Definers Public Affairs last year, initially for tracking media coverage, after widespread criticism of the way Facebook largely dismissed its role in spreading misinformation campaigns during the 2016 election.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Withdraws U.S. Forces From Syria, Declaring \u2018We Have Won Against ISIS\u2019", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Abandoning the Kurdish allies, the officials argued, also would cripple future American efforts to gain the trust of local fighters for counterterrorism operations, including in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry welcomed the move, according to the TASS news agency, saying that a withdrawal created prospects for a political settlement in Syria\u2019s civil war.

That false turn came in April 2017, after Mr. Assad\u2019s forces used chemical weapons in an attack that killed more than 80 civilians in an Idlib Province neighborhood that opposed Mr. Assad\u2019s brutal rule.\n\nMr. Trump, operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, with President Xi Jinping of China waiting at his dinner table, ordered an airstrike against a Syrian base where the attack had originated."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "U.S. Exit Seen as a Betrayal of the Kurds, and a Boon for ISIS", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/world/middleeast/syria-kurds-isis-us.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "The day that President Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Syria, the Islamic State claimed that it had set off a bomb in Raqqa, the group\u2019s former capital, killing a Kurdish fighter.\n\nIt was a small, isolated attack, but the Islamic State\u2019s boast was a canny assertion of the stakes in the American withdrawal \u2014 and an indication that the group was looking forward to exploiting a changed reality in Syria.\n\nThe United States withdrawal announced Wednesday is seen by analysts as an abandonment of America\u2019s key allies in Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, and a boon for the Islamic State \u2014 which still controls territory in southeastern Syria, is believed to still have thousands of fighters there and has continued to carry out attacks.\n\nThe withdrawal is also expected to give a green light to Turkey to carry out its threatened invasion of northeastern Syria, a move likely to draw Kurdish forces from the fight against the Islamic State in the southeast."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Senate Passes Stopgap Spending Bill That Would Avert Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/government-shutdown-threat.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-20 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "The bill would not only maintain funding for the departments and agencies covered by seven spending bills that have not passed, but it would also extend a number of programs set to expire, including the Violence Against Women Act, the National Flood Insurance Program and critical Medicaid provisions.\n\nAvoiding a partial government shutdown was a welcome prospect for lawmakers, particularly given the holiday timing and the number of lawmakers who await retirement at the end of the session or have quietly left after their November defeats.

Try to get them to recognize the compulsive quality of their behavior. Show them what researchers know about nicotine addiction and the questions they are raising about the possible long-term harms of vaping.\n\nThe goal is to encourage them to want to quit for their own good, not just to give you lip service and continue behind your back.\n\nAre all teenagers who try vaping likely to become addicted?\n\nNot necessarily. Some people can smoke one cigarette and have a glass of wine at a party \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\n\nBut nicotine addiction can happen swiftly and is extremely hard to extinguish. One factor is the amount of nicotine the user is exposed to.
