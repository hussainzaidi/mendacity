The policy, signed on November 9, bars migrants who illegally cross into the US through the southern border from seeking asylum outside of official ports of entry.\n\nA district court blocked the policy -- nationwide -- last month holding that the policy \"irreconcilably conflicts\" with immigration law.\n\nA panel of judges on the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction in an opinion penned by Judge Jay Bybee, a George W. Bush nominee.\n\nAfter the opinion was released, Francisco turned to the Supreme Court arguing that the justices should greenlight the President's proclamation pending appeal so that \"claims can be processed in an orderly manner; deter unlawful and dangerous border crossings; and reduce the backlog of meritless asylum claims.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Federal judge in Texas strikes down Obamacare Replay More Videos ...

Under normal circumstances, the justices prefer to benefit from lower court opinions, and are disinclined to grant a so called \"cert before judgment.\"\n\nIn court papers, Francisco told the justices that if they decide not to take up the case, they should at least allow the policy to go into effect pending appeal.\n\nFrancisco argued that Defense Secretary James Mattis had worked with a panel of senior military leaders to determine the policy but that because lower courts had issued nationwide injunctions, \"it is unlikely that the military will be able to implement its new policy any time soon.\"\n\nThe court, he wrote, should step in to resolve a threat to \"readiness, good order and discipline, sound leadership, and unit cohesion\" which he said are \"essential to military effectiveness and lethality.\"\n\nFrancisco acknowledged that his request was out of the ordinary but said it was necessary to combat a \"growing trend in which federal district courts, at the behest of particular plaintiffs, have issued nationwide injunctions, typically on a preliminary basis, against major policy initiatives.\"\n\n\"In less than two years, federal courts have issued 25 of them, blocking a wide range of significant policies involving national security, national defense, immigration and domestic issues,\" he said.\n\nDACA\n\nThe justices are also considering a petition from the government to allow the phase out of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- an Obama-era initiative that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\n\nLower courts have issued injunctions holding that the administration acted illegally when it sought to wind down the program, and have so far allowed renewals to continue.\n\nFrancisco requested that the Supreme Court take up the issue this term.\n\n\"Only this Court can resolve the conflict in the lower courts and provide much-needed clarity to the government and DACA recipients alike,\" he wrote.\n\nTrump has said he assumed the Supreme Court will eventually have to take up DACA, and has also maintained any court action will figure in to how he and Congress eventually address immigration legislation.\n\n\"Had the judge not ruled that way, I think we would have made a deal,\" Trump said at a news conference last month. \"Once the judge ruled that way, the Democrats didn't want to talk anymore.

They seek to interview senior administration officials such as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about the rationale behind their decision to add the question.\n\n\"The secretary was personally involved to an extraordinary degree in the project to add a citizenship question,\" argued New York state Attorney General Barbara Underwood in court papers. She added that \"significant gaps in the record remain that only the secretary's testimony will fill.\"\n\nBut the Trump administration says the administration has already produced thousands of pages of documents in the case and that the administrative record should suffice.\n\nAs the Court deals with issues, the justices are keenly aware that the President has ratcheted up judicial attacks. When a district court judge ruled against him on the asylum ban, for instance, the president called the judge \"an Obama judge\" suggesting that the motives were political.\n\nThe comments prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice Roberts.\n\n\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" he said in response to a question posed by the Associated Press. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sen.

It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nEven the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nAnd most importantly for many folks, Obamacare prevents insurers from turning away or charging more to those with pre-existing conditions. This provision proved so popular that even Republican candidates found themselves promising to defend it in the recent midterm election in an unsuccessful bid to retain their majority in the House. Some 52 million people, or 27% of non-elderly adults, have a pre-existing condition that would have prevented them from getting coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\"You'd be hard pressed to find a part of the health care system that was not touched by the ACA,\" said Larry Levitt, the foundation's senior vice president, of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll this, however, could be swept away by a US District Court judge in Texas, who ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. It seeks to accomplish what Republicans have tried to do for years: repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe decision , which is expected to be appealed, doesn't immediately affect Americans' coverage. But if it's upheld by higher courts, it could turn back the clock on the nation's health care system to before Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, when the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 18.2%. It's now 10.3%.\n\nHere's what's at risk:\n\nMedicare\n\nObamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in the program.\n\nThe health reform law made many changes to Medicare. It slowed the growth of payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Medicare enrollees also receive free preventative benefits, such as screenings for breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nAnd Obamacare helped close the gap in Medicare's drug coverage and was on track to completely eliminate it by 2020. Senior citizens have to pay more for drugs while they are in the donut hole, which lies between the initial coverage and catastrophic coverage phases. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 accelerated the closing of the coverage gap to 2019.)\n\nBut Obamacare does mean higher costs for more affluent beneficiaries. The law froze the threshold for the Medicare premium surcharge at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples, so more people have become subject to it. The Affordable Care Act also added a premium surcharge on drug coverage for higher-income enrollees.\n\nEmployer-sponsored insurance\n\nObamacare requires that companies with at least 50 employees provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nThis mandate didn't have a major impact on the 150 million workers who are insured through their jobs. Most larger employers already offer coverage for full-time workers. However, setting the bar at 30 hours a week prompted some employers to extend coverage to more of their staff, since many companies had considered that threshold to be part-time.\n\nAlso, the law allows children to remain on their parents' plans until they turn 26. This has proven to be one of the more popular Obamacare provisions and has helped lower the uninsured rate of this age group.\n\nWorkers also no longer have to pay for contraceptives and preventative screenings, such as colonoscopies and mammograms. Obamacare requires these be provided free of charge.\n\nThe ACA also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending.\n\nObamacare also had an impact on employees who work at companies with fewer than 50 workers. Insurers can no longer ban workers with pre-existing conditions or ask them to pay more. The law requires plans to cover an array of benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. And it limits insurers from charging older workers premiums more than three times those of younger workers.\n\nHowever, this more comprehensive coverage has come at a price. Obamacare's regulations caused premiums to spike, forcing some small businesses to stop offering health insurance to their workers.\n\nIndividual market\n\nObamacare has had the largest impact on the individual market, which was largely unregulated prior to the health reform law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and banned them from charging the sick more. The law ended the practice of insurers imposing annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and it also placed limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. It mandates that insurers provide more comprehensive benefits, including medication, maternity and mental health. It prevents insurers from charging women more and restricts premiums for older folks to no more than three times those of young adults.\n\nObamacare set up health insurance exchanges to allow Americans to shop for individual policies and created federal subsidies so low- and moderate-income enrollees could buy policies for less than 10% of their income. It also limits the deductibles and co-payments for lower-income policyholders.\n\nNearly 11.8 million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. About 2.5 million Americans purchased individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. They cannot apply for subsidies, but receive all of the other benefits.\n\nMany consumers, however, have not been happy with the changes Obamacare wrought -- particularly because they caused premiums to spike. Many middle class Americans who don't qualify for subsidies have dropped their coverage, saying it's now unaffordable.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to undermine the law by providing alternative coverage -- such as short-term health policies -- that don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's provisions, particularly those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. It is also allowing states to apply for changes to their Obamacare programs. The main beneficiaries of these efforts are younger and healthier Americans, who will be able to buy less comprehensive policies with lower premiums.\n\nMedicaid\n\nBefore Obamacare, most Medicaid enrollees were low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the disabled and the elderly.\n\nThe health reform law opened up the program to low-income adults with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty threshold -- $16,700 for a single person -- in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. Nearly 12 million Americans gained coverage under this provision as of 2016, the most recent figures available.\n\nUnder the program, the federal government paid 100% of the costs of the expansion population for the first three years and is slowly lowering the reimbursement rate to 90%."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: A bomb dropped on America's health care system", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/P7bJNcprdcU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Timothy Jost is an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University.

U.S., was a victory for the 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors who had brought the case in February, asking the court to block operation of the health care law. They based their attack on the law's requirement that people either buy health insurance or pay a penalty, which opponents of the law have long called an unconstitutional mandate.\n\nIn a landmark decision in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law by declaring that mandate was actually a tax, which Congress had the authority to impose. But when Congress reduced the tax to zero last year, the plaintiffs argued that now -- without its individual-responsibility enforcement mechanism -- the entire Affordable Care Act was suddenly unconstitutional.\n\nJudge O'Connor agreed. He said further that the law and its mandate could not be separated, and with this key part missing, the whole law should collapse, like a pillar of blocks in the game Jenga.\n\nThe scope of Judge O'Connor's judgment is breathtaking. The ACA contains ten titles and hundreds of individual provisions governing every corner of our health care system.

He is part of a group of senior ministers -- Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark -- who believe a new referendum is the only way to break the parliamentary gridlock, it added.\n\nThe Sunday Times also reported May's Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell told Cabinet ministers that a second referendum was \"the only way forward.\" Both men later distanced themselves from the report on Sunday, with Barwell taking to Twitter to deny the claims.\n\nSince there is an unusual level of interest this morning in what I am up to, happy to confirm I am off to play football followed by a few hours work (this will *not* include planning for a 2nd referendum) followed by putting a Christmas tree up \u2014 Gavin Barwell (@GavinBarwell) December 16, 2018\n\nThe Prime Minister also hit out on Sunday at her predecessor Tony Blair, after he called for a second referendum. May condemned his call as an \"insult to the office he once held and the people he once served.\" In response, Blair said he was speaking in the national interest and in the interests of democracy.\n\n\"Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying,\" he said according to Press Association. \"What is irresponsible, however, is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal.\"\n\nBut even if May and the opposition leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn are united in their distaste for a second referendum -- at least publicly -- it is increasingly looking like a viable option.\n\nBritish bookmaker William Hill estimated the probability of a second referendum at 54%. \"We think she (May) is out of options and the most palatable of the two remaining options (which includes revoking Article 50) is a people's vote,\" spokesperson Rupert Adams told CNN.\n\nThose odds began to shorten for a second plebiscite on Monday, when the European Court of Justice ruled that Britain could cancel Brexit without the permission of the other 27 EU members. That decision came as news filtered out that May would abort a parliamentary vote on a withdrawal agreement she drafted with the EU , after it became clear she would lose the vote \"by a significant margin.\"\n\nThe embattled leader then staggered through a vote of no confidence, triggered by hardline Brexiteers. She survived the vote by 200 votes to 117, but what it revealed was one third of her MPs don't support her Brexit plans -- and more than 170 of those who publicly stated they backed her are on the government payroll.\n\nRisk of no deal\n\nAmid this political crisis, which has been called the \"greatest failure of British statecraft since Suez,\" it's unclear how, or if, either side has shifted public opinion.\n\nBy Thursday, Brussels had refused to give May concessions to make her package palatable to British lawmakers. Brexit is more deadlocked than ever; and with just over 100 days before the March 29, 2019 deadline to leave, time to find an alternative to her deal is vanishing. What this risks is crashing out of the EU without a deal, which experts agree would be catastrophic for the British economy.\n\nThe Bank of England warned in November that such a scenario would sink the UK economy into recession\n\nLeaving with no deal means dropping out of the legal and regulatory frameworks that have governed the UK's trade, and much of its internal economy, for more than 40 years. It could disrupt food and manufacturing supplies, with many British exports losing their accreditation to be sold in the EU. The government has also warned planes could be grounded , with up to six months of disruption at some ports."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Analysis: After 30 years, leaders are still fighting about basic truths of climate science", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/VTilxzU6_ls/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Katowice, Poland (CNN) Hidden in the 133-page document agreed upon at the UN climate change talks was a compromise that many consider an infuriating distraction. The countries of the world agreed to welcome the fact that a scientific report on the state of global warming had been produced. But they failed to welcome its findings.\n\nThat seemingly small difference is massive in the hyper-subtle, hyper-polite world of climate diplomacy. So massive, in fact, that the bickering over the wording hung like a cloud over these negotiations. Almost 200 countries agreed -- barely -- to a \"rulebook\" governing the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is meant to help limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nDebate over whether to \"welcome\" the findings or simply \"note\" their existence flared up a week ago. The United States, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia -- among the leading producers of fossil fuels, which cause climate change -- stated publicly that they did not want to \"welcome\" the findings of a report the UN head had called an \"ear-splitting wake-up call.\"\n\nThat report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says carbon pollution must be cut about in half by 2030 and reach \"net zero\" by mid-century to avoid what could be described as disastrous climate change -- superstorms, floods and the like. Polish students walked out of school and into negotiations holding signs that underscored the urgency in this latest assessment of the science: \"12 years left.\"\n\nThat urgency is new, but the basic science is not. Thirty years ago, a NASA scientist testified before Congress that the era of human-induced global warming had begun. In 1992, countries agreed to create the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees talks on global warming now held at the end of each year.\n\nThe fact that discord remains on the basics of the science -- much less the actual process of how to cut pollution and how to govern that process -- stunned some delegates and observers at the talks, which, symbolically, were held in Europe's \"coal capital.\"\n\n\"We were not able to get the strong endorsement we should have,\" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group.\n\nWhat the IPCC report declares is a \"planetary emergency,\" he said.\n\nYet there also was a sense of \"relief\" that the countries could agree on a statement at all -- and that they produced a rulebook that is seen by many as setting the stage for a detailed accounting of emissions and new pledges to cut pollution that will be submitted in 2020.\n\nThose concrete rules are more important than the fights about the validity of the IPCC report, said Yamide Dagnet, project director on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change for the World Resources Institute, a group that studies environmental policy.\n\n\"We really have the foundations we need to move forward, not to wait,\" Dagnet said in Poland. \"We regret what happened last Saturday, but we need to remember it was just a handful of countries that contested this report ... What matters is what you do about it.\"\n\nThe what-to-do-about-it is what concerns Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York. The fight over how to treat the IPCC report, which is regarded as the premier science on this issue, is a massive distraction, he said.\n\n\"What's sad is how much time is wasted on those words because what's really looming over this are the acts of the Trump administration and a few other governments to willfully put the planet at risk,\" Sachs said. \"It's not a matter of belief or denial. It's a matter of putting oil and coal company -- and country -- interests above the interests of all of humanity.\n\n\"It got translated into many frustrating days of arguing over a few words.\"\n\nWhat's happening should be considered \"climate crimes against humanity,\" he said.\n\n\"It's nothing less than that and that's how history will record what the Trump administration is doing right now: These are crimes against humanity,\" he told CNN. \"Many people are dying as a result of this. And it's not a sufficient defense to say, 'I don't believe it.' \"\n\nThe Paris Rulebook is meant to govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which was decided at a similar UN meeting three years ago. US President Donald Trump has pledged to abandon that agreement, but the country still had a presence at the COP24 talks, which concluded in an overtime session late Saturday night.\n\nTrump at times has denied the basic science of climate change, which states that burning coal, oil and natural gas produces emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet. It's become increasingly clear that warming is happening faster than previously thought and with worse results. The US National Climate Assessment published this year says thousands of Americans could die and gross domestic product could take a 10% hit by century's end.\n\nTrump has advocated for burning more coal, a major cause of climate pollution. In Poland, the US delegation held an event dedicated to coal and fossil fuel technologies.\n\nA US State Department spokesperson said the event was intended to show \"the remarkable progress we have made through innovation for cleaner technologies.\"\n\n\"These job-creating innovations have contributed to reducing US emissions while also growing our economy and providing reliable and affordable access to energy,\" the spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe event was interrupted by a group of young people mock-laughing at the display.\n\n\"It's so ridiculous. It's a joke,\" said Vic Barrett, a 19-year-old protester.\n\n\"We're done listening to false solutions and things we know don't work.\"\n\nSome negotiators emphasized that only four countries stood up to decline welcoming the science.

He's expected to sign it into law.\n\nNow that hemp is (almost) legal, there are all kinds of implications for farmers, researchers and consumers.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the plant that's bringing together farmers, potheads and politicians.\n\nHemp has been treated like marijuana\n\nFor decades, the federal government has treated hemp just like any other cannabis plant. Since 1970, it had been classified as a schedule 1 drug on the Drug Enforcement Administration's list of controlled substances, alongside heroin, LSD and marijuana. The DEA defines schedule 1 drugs as having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\n\nThe new bill takes hemp off that list.\n\nThe schedule 1 designation made universities reluctant to get involved in hemp research, according to Lawrence Smart, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University.\n\n\"With hemp being legalized now, those restrictions and hesitations about legal jeopardy have been removed,\" Smart said. \"I expect that we'll see many more researchers willing to get involved in hemp research.\"\n\nHemp won't get you high\n\nHemp and marijuana aren't the same thing. They both come from the same species of cannabis, but if you try to smoke hemp, you'll probably just end up with a headache.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon put it bluntly: \"Federal law treats hemp like it's a dangerous drug, but the only thing you're going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting breath, time and lighter fluid.\"\n\nFederal law treats hemp like it's a dangerous drug, but the only thing you're going to accomplish by smoking hemp is wasting breath, time and lighter fluid. \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) April 12, 2018\n\nHemp has extremely low levels of THC, the compound in marijuana that gets people stoned. It's higher in CBD, a compound that many people believe helps them with anxiety, arthritis, stress and other conditions.\n\nHemp gets a lot of hype over CBD products such as oils, supplements and vapes. Although CBD can come from marijuana, too, it's simpler for companies to use hemp-derived CBD because the extract is legal in all states.\n\nIt's not just CBD, though -- hemp can be used to produce all kinds of things, including clean fuel for cars, building materials, clothes, food and beer.\n\nIt's legal to buy and sell hemp products in the United States. But because growing hemp has been so tightly regulated, the domestic market for hemp products is extremely small. So a lot of those products are imported from Europe, Canada and China.\n\nMitch McConnell (yes, that Mitch McConnell) led the charge to legalize it\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell was a major leader in getting legislation on hemp passed. He put himself on the conference committee for the 2018 farm bill. Monday, he signed the final version of the 2018 farm bill -- and used a pen made from hemp to do it.\n\nMaking it official with my hemp pen!\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Proud to have served as conferee on #FarmBill & to fight for #Kentucky priorities. With today's signature, my provision to legalize industrial #hemp is 1 step closer to reality. Looking forward to voting YES on this bill & sending to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/8ypwBebXy7 \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) December 10, 2018\n\nIf you're wondering how the Republican Senate Majority Leader became one of the biggest proponents of a plant once considered a cousin of marijuana, look to his home state of Kentucky.\n\nAnti-smoking campaigns and high cigarette taxes have dealt a blow to Kentucky's once-thriving tobacco industry.\n\nThe USDA estimated that Kentucky farmers harvested an estimated 55,000 acres of burley tobacco, used primarily for cigarette production. That's down 8,000 acres from last year. In the 1990s, burley harvests reached above 200,000 acres.\n\nNow Kentucky has one of the largest hemp industries in the country -- and McConnell says he thinks hemp could become the state's new cash crop.\n\n\"Kentucky has a proven track record for favorable growing conditions for hemp, and there was no legitimate reason why our farmers shouldn't be allowed to grow the crop and capitalize on this growing market,\" McConnell wrote in an op-ed for The Courier-Journal\n\nAt a time when farm income is down and growers are struggling, industrial hemp is a bright spot of agriculture's future. My provision in the Farm Bill will not only legalize domestic hemp, but it will also allow state departments of agriculture to be responsible for its oversight \u2014 Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) December 11, 2018\n\nHemp is one of those rare bipartisan issues, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in big farming states.\n\nThat doesn't mean weed will become legal, too\n\nIf you're hopeful about what this bill means for legal pot, don't hold your breath.\n\nThis newest Congress seems more open to legalizing pot than ever, but Republicans still control the Senate. And McConnell and many other senators (from both parties) remain opposed to marijuana legalization.\n\nIt's true that Trump hasn't been a vocal opponent of marijuana. But he's certainly not leading the charge to light up.\n\nFarmers stand to win big, but it won't be easy\n\nWith falling prices of crops, increasing debt and an ongoing trade war with China, US farmers have been struggling. Once hemp is legal, farmers will have greater access to a whole new market.\n\nThough hemp products can easily be found in stores, actually growing it was a lot trickier. Previously, farmers could only cultivate hemp for research under pilot programs monitored by their state and the US Department of Agriculture, a provision made possible by the 2014 farm bill.\n\nThe 2018 bill loosens a lot of restrictions on hemp production, and farmers can also apply for USDA crop insurance and grant programs. The bill also specifically allows tribal nations to grow hemp on their lands.\n\nBut growing hemp won't be as simple as growing tomatoes or corn.\n\nThe previous restrictions around growing hemp means there isn't a good seed bank, which captures the plant's genetic diversity. In other words, a lot of plant breeders are starting from scratch in figuring out what pests and diseases they're up against, and how hemp fits in with the rest of their crops.\n\nThere are also concerns about what is classified as hemp -- the legal definition states that the plant cannot contain more than 0.3% THC. Farmers looking to grow the crop will have to comply with regulations set by their states. Farmers in states that don't develop plans for hemp regulation will have to abide by USDA standards.\n\nAnd though the bill opens up hemp growing to a lot more farmers, not everyone gets to participate.\n\nAnyone with a felony drug conviction is banned from growing hemp. It's a provision that critics say disproportionately affects nonwhite people, continuing the legacy of the war on drugs.\n\nMcConnell added the felon ban to appease concerns he received from the Senate Judiciary Committee, the administration and outside interest groups, according to Politico\n\n\"It's ludicrous,\" said Lex Pelger, head of education for the Colorado hemp and CBD company Bluebird Botanicals. \"If there's one thing we could change, that would be it.\"\n\nThe CBD industry is also really excited\n\nHemp oil products are displayed during the Cannabis World Congress in New York.\n\nCBD is everywhere these days -- in lattes, lotion and even dog food.\n\nHemp-derived CBD sales in the United States reached $190 million last year, and one report projects the CBD oil market will reach $1 billion by 2020\n\nPelger predicts retailers will now feel more comfortable about jumping into the CBD game.\n\nThough the DEA has said in recent years that it wouldn't go after businesses and consumers over hemp or CBD, a lot of researchers and retailers were still nervous about entering the market.\n\n\"This will carry the already booming industry to the next level,\" Pelger said.\n\nThe new law also makes things easier for existing CBD businesses. Pelger said it will give companies expanded access to credit card processors and advertising on major platforms.\n\n\"You can imagine running a business and having a number of tools that you need not be available,\" Pegler said.\n\nThe new law is good news for consumers, too, said Pegler.\n\nLoosening restrictions on growing hemp means more competition, more sources of hemp and, advocates hope, better quality.\n\nStill, you should be wary of the hemp hype\n\nThere's a lot of hype about hemp. On the farming side, people claim it's easier to grow and adaptable to most climates. Others say it can clean contaminants from the soil and improve soil quality.\n\nNot true, says Smart.\n\n\"Many of these things have not been properly studied in these controlled experiments and may or may not live up to the hype,\" Smart said.\n\nA lot of people swear by the health and wellness benefits they get from hemp. But because of all the restrictions hemp has been under, there isn't a lot of research on what's effective and what conditions hemp can alleviate.\n\nThe bill is important step because it legitimizes hemp, Pelger said. And now that it's easier to research hemp and enter the industry, we'll likely see more opportunities for innovation.\n\n\"It's going to be fascinating to see what the American market does with this old, intriguing plant.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "California abandons plan to tax texts", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/QNK_SM5dbHg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "San Francisco (CNN Business) California regulators no longer plan to tax text messages.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission said a new FCC ruling prevented the state from levying a tax on text plans.

Bernie Sanders and Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke joining him as the only possible candidates in the field with double-digit support.\n\nThe new Iowa Poll finds 32% of likely caucusgoers saying they back Biden as their first choice, 19% Sanders, 11% O'Rourke, 8% Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 5% California Sen. Kamala Harris, with the rest of the 20-person field testing below 5% support.\n\nThe top three candidates in Iowa, including O'Rourke's third-place ranking, match the top three in a national CNN poll released Friday . Early results nationally are often driven by name recognition, but in Iowa, the campaign is already underway, with several of the tested candidates having made multiple visits to the state, and at least one having already visited all 99 of the state's counties.\n\nIowa's caucusgoers, who get the first formal say in who the party's nominee will be, mostly say they are looking for a winner (54% want a candidate who can defeat Trump) over ideological purity (40% want one who shares their positions on major issues). Those who prioritize a winning candidate are more apt to back Biden and O'Rourke than the overall pool of likely caucusgoers (36% in that group say they favor Biden, 14% Sanders, 14% O'Rourke) while Sanders outperforms his overall number among those looking for a candidate who shares their issue positions (30% Biden, 26% Sanders, 8% O'Rourke).\n\nOverall, more say that nominating a seasoned political hand (49%) would be a better way for the Democrats to try to to defeat Trump than to nominate a newcomer to politics (36%), and the bevy of senators (plus one congressman) atop the field may reflect that preference. The political newcomers tested -- businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang -- both failed to register much support in the poll.\n\nMost of Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers say they'd prefer to see a field with a number of strong contenders (52%) rather than a race dominated by one strong candidate emerging early as a clear frontrunner (41%), and the poll's findings suggest they are open to considering a large number of candidates. That's a contrast with the mood of Democrats nationwide, a majority of whom, after a bruising 2016 nomination battle that lasted through the entire primary season, say they are hopeful for the quick ascension of a frontrunner, according to CNN's poll.\n\nBeyond the horse race question, the Iowa survey asked likely caucusgoers if they could ever consider each of the candidates tested in the poll who they did not choose as their first- or second-choice candidate, or if they would never support that person. Nearly half (46%) of likely caucusgoers said there wasn't a single candidate in the field they would never support. Another 12% said there was only one candidate they would rule out.\n\nAnd many of those tested in the survey remain unknown, even to Iowa's politically active caucusgoers. Majorities said they could not offer an opinion on 12 of the 20 potential candidates when asked a basic favorability rating.\n\nOf the better-known candidates in the field, four merited favorable views from a majority of likely caucusgoers -- Biden (82% favorable), Sanders (74%), Warren (64%) and O'Rourke (53%). Booker and Harris weren't far behind with 49% rating each of them favorably, and former Attorney General Eric Holder also topped 40% favorability, landing at 42% in the poll.\n\nAlthough Holder doesn't register much support as a first or a second choice -- just 1% say they would put him in their top two right now -- 50% say they would ever consider backing him for president, a higher number than just about anyone else who ranked that far down the first-choice scale. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand also comes close with 48% saying they'd consider her, though her favorability rating is a bit lower at 35%.\n\nWhat Iowa Democrats seem certain about is that they don't want to see another run from Hillary Clinton. Almost three-quarters say that if she were to get in the race she would detract from it (72% say so), and her favorability rating is narrowly upside down, with 49% holding an unfavorable opinion vs. 47% who have a positive view.\n\nTwo others who have flirted with presidential runs are also seen as more apt to detract from the race than to add to it: Oprah Winfrey (55% say she would do more to detract than add) and Howard Schultz (55% detract). Views on Michelle Obama, however, tilt sharply in the opposite direction. Three-quarters say she would add to the race for president should she throw her hat in the ring (76%), while just 22% say she would detract from it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "5 takeaways from the new CNN/Des Moines Register poll", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MIlvtJlXqSg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) We have the first look at the state of play in Iowa in advance of the caucuses -- which will kick off the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in roughly a year's time.\n\nThe obvious lesson is that -- at this early stage -- being well-known is the key.

It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items. And it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nEven the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nAnd most importantly for many folks, Obamacare prevents insurers from turning away or charging more to those with pre-existing conditions. This provision proved so popular that even Republican candidates found themselves promising to defend it in the recent midterm election in an unsuccessful bid to retain their majority in the House. Some 52 million people, or 27% of non-elderly adults, have a pre-existing condition that would have prevented them from getting coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\"You'd be hard pressed to find a part of the health care system that was not touched by the ACA,\" said Larry Levitt, the foundation's senior vice president, of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll this, however, could be swept away by a US District Court judge in Texas, who ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. It seeks to accomplish what Republicans have tried to do for years: repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe decision , which is expected to be appealed, doesn't immediately affect Americans' coverage. But if it's upheld by higher courts, it could turn back the clock on the nation's health care system to before Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, when the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 18.2%. It's now 10.3%.\n\nHere's what's at risk:\n\nMedicare\n\nObamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in the program.\n\nThe health reform law made many changes to Medicare. It slowed the growth of payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Medicare enrollees also receive free preventative benefits, such as screenings for breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nAnd Obamacare helped close the gap in Medicare's drug coverage and was on track to completely eliminate it by 2020. Senior citizens have to pay more for drugs while they are in the donut hole, which lies between the initial coverage and catastrophic coverage phases. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 accelerated the closing of the coverage gap to 2019.)\n\nBut Obamacare does mean higher costs for more affluent beneficiaries. The law froze the threshold for the Medicare premium surcharge at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples, so more people have become subject to it. The Affordable Care Act also added a premium surcharge on drug coverage for higher-income enrollees.\n\nEmployer-sponsored insurance\n\nObamacare requires that companies with at least 50 employees provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week.\n\nThis mandate didn't have a major impact on the 150 million workers who are insured through their jobs. Most larger employers already offer coverage for full-time workers. However, setting the bar at 30 hours a week prompted some employers to extend coverage to more of their staff, since many companies had considered that threshold to be part-time.\n\nAlso, the law allows children to remain on their parents' plans until they turn 26. This has proven to be one of the more popular Obamacare provisions and has helped lower the uninsured rate of this age group.\n\nWorkers also no longer have to pay for contraceptives and preventative screenings, such as colonoscopies and mammograms. Obamacare requires these be provided free of charge.\n\nThe ACA also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending.\n\nObamacare also had an impact on employees who work at companies with fewer than 50 workers. Insurers can no longer ban workers with pre-existing conditions or ask them to pay more. The law requires plans to cover an array of benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. And it limits insurers from charging older workers premiums more than three times those of younger workers.\n\nHowever, this more comprehensive coverage has come at a price. Obamacare's regulations caused premiums to spike, forcing some small businesses to stop offering health insurance to their workers.\n\nIndividual market\n\nObamacare has had the largest impact on the individual market, which was largely unregulated prior to the health reform law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and banned them from charging the sick more. The law ended the practice of insurers imposing annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and it also placed limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. It mandates that insurers provide more comprehensive benefits, including medication, maternity and mental health. It prevents insurers from charging women more and restricts premiums for older folks to no more than three times those of young adults.\n\nObamacare set up health insurance exchanges to allow Americans to shop for individual policies and created federal subsidies so low- and moderate-income enrollees could buy policies for less than 10% of their income. It also limits the deductibles and co-payments for lower-income policyholders.\n\nNearly 11.8 million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. About 2.5 million Americans purchased individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. They cannot apply for subsidies, but receive all of the other benefits.\n\nMany consumers, however, have not been happy with the changes Obamacare wrought -- particularly because they caused premiums to spike. Many middle class Americans who don't qualify for subsidies have dropped their coverage, saying it's now unaffordable.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to undermine the law by providing alternative coverage -- such as short-term health policies -- that don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's provisions, particularly those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. It is also allowing states to apply for changes to their Obamacare programs. The main beneficiaries of these efforts are younger and healthier Americans, who will be able to buy less comprehensive policies with lower premiums.\n\nMedicaid\n\nBefore Obamacare, most Medicaid enrollees were low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the disabled and the elderly.\n\nThe health reform law opened up the program to low-income adults with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty threshold -- $16,700 for a single person -- in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. Nearly 12 million Americans gained coverage under this provision as of 2016, the most recent figures available.\n\nUnder the program, the federal government paid 100% of the costs of the expansion population for the first three years and is slowly lowering the reimbursement rate to 90%."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Federal judge in Texas strikes down Affordable Care Act", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/E11oovOsnRg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act's individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand.\n\nLegal experts say the ruling won't immediately affect Americans' health coverage, and a group of states led by California is already vowing to appeal. But the invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe ruling and expected appeal sets up another cliffhanger in which the fate of the law, which Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal for years, will likely once again ultimately lie with the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote leaving the law intact in 2012, but it's unclear how the justices will view this challenge, which centers on changes to the individual mandate that were baked into the 2017 tax reform.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to undo Obamacare, was thwarted in Congress last year by a lone vote from the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain.\n\nTrump immediately tweeted in celebration on Friday and called on Congress to act.\n\n\"As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe later added, \"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump told reporters that if the decision is eventually upheld by the Supreme Court, \"we will be sitting down with the Democrats\" to \"get great health care for our people.\"\n\n\"Let's say repeal and replace, handled a little bit differently, but it was a big, big victory by a highly respected judge,\" Trump said during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nLater Saturday, Obama took to Facebook to urge people to enroll in the program, writing in a post that Friday's ruling \"can be a scary thing to hear, particularly if you or someone you care about has a pre-existing condition.\"\n\n\"As this decision makes its way through the courts, which will take months, if not years, the law remains in place and will likely stay that way,\" he wrote.\n\nDemocratic House leader Nancy Pelosi decried the ruling and suggested that the coming Democratic-led House will intervene in the case.\n\n\"Republicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision and for the fear they have struck into millions of families across America who are now in danger of losing their health coverage,\" Pelosi said in a statement released late Friday. \"When House Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nToday, the law governs American health care.\n\nMore than 4 million people have already signed up for 2019 coverage on the exchanges, and millions more are expected to pick plans before open enrollment ends Saturday.\n\nThe ruling threatens to wipe away the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which became a focal point of the midterm elections and helped Democrats take the House.\n\nIn his opinion, District Judge Reed O'Connor said the \"Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\"\n\nHe also held that the individual mandate is \"essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.\"\n\nThe case against the ACA was brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors, as well as two individuals. It revolves around Congress effectively eliminating the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe Republican coalition, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is arguing that the change rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional. The states say that the voiding of the penalty, which takes effect next year, removes the legal underpinning the Supreme Court relied upon when it upheld the law in 2012 under Congress' tax power.\n\nThe Trump administration said in June that it would not defend several important provisions of Obamacare in court. It agreed that zeroing out the penalty renders the individual mandate unconstitutional but argued that invalidates only the law's protections of those with pre-existing conditions. These include banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories, as well as limiting coverage of the treatment they need.\n\nBut the administration maintained those parts of the law were severable and the rest of the Affordable Care Act could remain in place.\n\nProfessor Tim Jost, of Washington and Lee University, noted that O'Connor went further than the Trump administration had asked.\n\n\"The Trump administration only asked that the individual mandate and provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions be invalidated, but O'Connor's order would invalidate many provisions of the Medicaid program, the Medicare program and other federal laws,\" he told CNN.\n\nBut Jost said the structure of the challenge and of O'Connor's ruling means that nothing will change right away.\n\n\"Judge O'Connor has declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act invalid, but he has not blocked its continued operation,\" Jost said.\n\nBecause the administration would not defend the law, California, joined by 16 other Democratic states, stepped in. They argued that the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, can stand without it. Also, they said that eliminating Obamacare or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of Americans.\n\nAppeal coming\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the ruling \"an assault\" and a spokesperson for his office indicated an appeal would be coming.\n\n\"Today's ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA's consumer protections for healthcare, on America's faithful progress toward affordable healthcare for all Americans,\" Becerra said in a statement. \"The ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAmerican Medical Association president Barbara McAneny said the group will work with other groups in pursuing an appeal and reversal of the decision.\n\n\"Today's decision is an unfortunate step backward for our health system that is contrary to overwhelming public sentiment to preserve pre-existing condition protections and other policies that have extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,\" she said in a statement. \"It will destabilize health insurance coverage by rolling back federal policy to 2009. No one wants to go back to the days of 20 percent of the population uninsured and fewer patient protections, but this decision will move us in that direction.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paxton applauded the ruling and said it represents a massive check on federal power.\n\n\"Today's ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system while our multistate coalition lawsuit works its way through the courts,\" Paxton said in a staement. \"Our lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said he felt an appeal could be looked on favorably by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The ruling relies on conclusions about who can bring this suit and about the impact of President Trump's tax bill that have been widely debunked by scholars from across the political spectrum,\" Vladeck said. \"It will certainly generate headlines, and it may even be upheld by the conservative federal appeals court in Texas, but it's difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court\u2014which has already turned away two challenges to the ACA\u2014would agree with tonight's ruling.\"\n\nPre-existing conditions and the midterm fight\n\nThe lawsuit entered the spotlight during the midterm elections, helping propel many Democratic candidates to victory. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions became a central focus of the races. Some 58% of Americans said they trust Democrats more to continue the law's provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October.\n\nThe consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to Obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape. Their popularity is one of the main reasons GOP lawmakers had such difficulty repealing Obamacare last year.\n\n\"Guaranteed issue\" requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurers often rejected applicants who are or had been ill or offered them only limited coverage with high rates.\n\nUnder the law's community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person's health history. And the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder's medical background.\n\nAll these provisions meant millions of people with less-than-perfect health records could get comprehensive coverage. But they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. This group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies that offered fewer benefits prior to Obamacare. That has put the measures in the crosshairs of Republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums.\n\nIt's no wonder that politicians on both sides of the aisle promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions during the election. Three-quarters of Americans say that it is \"very important\" for the law to continue prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage because of medical histories, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's September tracking poll -- 58% of Republicans feel the same way. And about the same share of Americans say it's \"very important\" that insurers continue to be barred from charging sick people more."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "110 things that happened in American politics in 2018", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/StJprpgiE34/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) There were a lot of things that happened this year in American politics, some of which you may have already completely forgotten about.

Some people encourage her to \"calm down\" and \"keep it quiet.\" Others scold her for wearing a mini-skirt. One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file.

When it was over, I said 'did you get what you wanted?' ... I carried my torn clothes and cried and screamed, and cried and screamed. And nobody heard me.\"\n\nHiba describes audiences going from room to room at Zico House, a cultural center in Beirut, listening to six actors tell survivors' stories as part of an immersive play, organized by #ShameOnWho.\n\n\"It was moving. It was intense. A lot of people cried. Some people couldn't watch all of the scenes.

We hear these stories on Facebook, or on TV but we never really encounter these people in our lives.\"\n\nBut Lebanon's civil society appears determined to give women a larger platform and counter social practices perceived as sexist.\n\nLast month, women's rights activists called for the boycott of the television channel MTV Lebanon after it aired an interview with Mohammed al-Nheily, the husband and convicted killer of 33-year-old Manal Assi, in a program on Lebanese prisoners called Out of Freedom. Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ... 'I'm going to send it to the whole society for them to see what a bad person you are,'\" the woman recalls.\n\nFor two months, the woman cried herself to sleep until she mustered the courage to confront her harasser.\n\n\"I told him 'you can show the video to whoever you want ... This is my body and I'm free to do whatever I want.

Since the 1930s , scientists have usled fetal tissue in the US, obtained through elective abortions in medical research and experimental therapies. And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not. Humanized mice, which possess human cells, DNA tissues or immune systems, are used in some biomedical research.\n\nAccording to the scientist whose humanized mouse research was debated between the two sides, some truth can be found on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhat's the issue with human fetal tissue?\n\nIn September, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled a contract with a fetal tissue procurement company due to concerns that the company was not meeting regulations. Subsequently, HHS initiated an audit of human fetal tissue acquisitions and a review to understand whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\n\nHowever, those opposed to abortion have sought, for decades, to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue, while those in the research world support its use.\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. The National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows.\n\nNot only has the federal government funded fetal tissue research for more than seven decades with procurement governed by an \"extensive regulatory framework,\" but fetal tissue research has a \"long history of support from both sides of the aisle,\" said Judy Chu, the Democratic representative from California who sits on the Steering and Policy Committee, during the hearing. Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: What happens next may have to be put to MPs' vote - Fox", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46584654", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Liam Fox: 'How do we tell the SNP that they can't have another referendum on independence?'\n\nParliament might have to decide what to do next if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected by MPs, cabinet minister Liam Fox has said.\n\nThe senior Brexiteer said the PM's deal was unlikely to pass through Parliament unless the backstop issue was resolved.\n\nHe said one option could be a \"free vote\" for MPs.\n\nAn alternative being widely suggested is another referendum - but Mr Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this was unlikely and would not \"heal division\".\n\nOther options backed by different groups of MPs include leaving without a deal, another referendum, or Norway or Canada-style alternative deals.

binding agreements between EU member countries that set out rules and objectives for decision-making.\n\nThey have to be approved by all 28 EU members before they can take effect.\n\nIn 27 states it is the governments that approve the treaties - but in the Republic of Ireland the laws have to be put to a referendum, where citizens get to vote on whether or not to implement the law.\n\nIf a majority of Irish citizens vote against the treaty in the referendum, that means it can't take effect in any EU member state at all.\n\nSo why is the Republic of Ireland different?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt all comes down to Irish history, and the country's unique constitution, says Conor O'Mahony, a senior lecturer at University College Cork.\n\nThe Irish constitution, which came into force in 1937 and replaced the 1922 constitution of the Irish Free State, made clear that \"no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the state\" or infringe upon the state's new-found sovereignty.\n\nAny changes to it require citizens to approve amendments by way of a referendum.\n\nO'Mahony says that was directed towards Westminster, primarily, as well as the Republic of Ireland's desire to promote democratic participation.\n\nBut, when it joined the EU, that meant signing Ireland up to new laws and measures from the European Parliament.\n\nThe Irish constitution was amended to reflect the country's fresh ties to the EU, and the government hoped that would negate the need for any future referendums relating to EU matters.\n\nBut it didn't?\n\nNo.\n\nIn 1987, a landmark court case - Crotty v An Taoiseach - ruled that any significant EU laws could not be ratified without first having been approved in a referendum in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAt the time, the EU was trying to implement the Single European Act (SEA).\n\nO'Mahony explains: \"What it all hinged on, was that certain measures the Irish government had signed up to involved giving away aspects of sovereignty, such as giving the EU more control on issues around foreign relations.\n\n\"What the Supreme Court said in the Crotty judgement was because the SEA was an encroachment on sovereignty not there in a previous EU treaty, the Treaty of Rome, it would need a fresh referendum.\"\n\nThat case set a precedent and with each subsequent EU treaty, there has been a referendum held on it in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHow is that viewed by the other EU states?\n\nIt can be awkward, says Conor O'Mahony.\n\n\"In all of these cases the rest of Europe had to stand and wait while we had a referendum.\n\n\"There is sometimes a sense when you try to explain it to people in other countries of: 'Why do 300 million people have to wait for votes of a million people'?\"\n\nBut the power to have the referendum can also have consequences and cause chaos across the EU.\n\nIn two instances in recent years, Irish citizens voted against EU treaties in two referendums: the Nice Treaty in 2001 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2008.\n\nIt took a second referendum in both cases before the EU could ratify and implement the treaties.\n\nO'Mahony says as Irish referendums are successful or defeated based on a simple majority, there can be situations where a referendum could defeated by just a few thousand votes.\n\n\"Other EU members do sometimes struggle to figure out why such a small number of people get to make a decision on something so huge,\" he adds.\n\n\"On the other side it begs the question, how can you have an electorate making a fully informed decision on something so complicated?\"\n\nWhat does that mean for Irish citizens, having to vote more often?\n\nThat depends on who you ask.\n\nOnly a small fraction of amendments to the Irish constitution relate to the EU, with other topics including more high-profile issues such as legalising same-sex marriage, abortion and most recently, a vote to overturn a law on blasphemy generating widespread attention.\n\nConor O'Mahony says people have become accustomed to having their say.\n\n\"If the government was to go ahead and sign up to a new treaty, wanted to proceed without a referendum - there would be a certain amount of human pride, saying: \"Hold on, don't we get a vote on this?\"\n\nBut he accepts it might only be more informed citizens arguing to get a vote on legally tricky EU matters.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to hold a referendum on something as complicated as EU issues,\" he adds, pointing out that turnout in previous EU treaty referendums has been low - the first referendum on the Nice Treaty saw just a turnout of just 34%.\n\nDoes Ireland's 'trump card' on EU issues tie into Brexit at all?\n\nThe Irish government has taken centre stage in the Brexit negotiations, in its demands on the NI border backstop - the insurance policy arrangement to ensure a frictionless border after Brexit.\n\nThere have been calls by UK politicians for it to be ditched, as if it took effect, it would see the UK staying in the backstop until the EU agreed it was no longer necessary.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?

which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU.\n\nBut anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia.\n\nNationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa.\n\nHowever, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list.\n\nSo it is introducing the ETIAS - an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is \"way cheaper\".\n\nIt is not a visa but a travel requirement for anyone on that list of 61 non-EU countries who are coming to the EU for business, tourism, medical or transit-related reasons for up to 90 days.\n\nThe EU says the ETIAS system will \"to strengthen security checks on those persons who travel visa-free to the EU\".\n\nWhat will UK travellers to the EU have to do?\n\nUnder the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020.\n\nAfter this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return.\n\nBut although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal.\n\nThe form - which the EU describes as a \"necessary and small procedural step\" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says.\n\nThe details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption UK passports -

If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\n\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\n\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\n\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\n\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\n\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\n\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\n\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\n\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\n\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\n\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\n\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\n\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\n\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\n\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\n\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\n\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\n\nHow did we make the calculator?\n\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\n\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n\nWhat about serving sizes?\n\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\n\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\n\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\n\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\n\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\n\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres.

What are the key points to come out of the meeting?\n\n1. The rules are key to the game\n\nHowever dull it may be, the operational rules for the 2015 Paris climate agreement will govern the way the world tackles climate change for decades to come.\n\nThe key thing was not to unravel the carefully negotiated Paris agreement by having one set of rules for the rich countries and another one for the poor.\n\nBy that measure the conference was a success with China showing leadership by not pushing for a return to the old ways of countries who did, and countries who didn't.\n\nAlso helping that effort was the US. Ensuring that the China and the US face similar regulations has long been a key of American policy.\n\nKeeping everyone on the same page also delighted the EU. Climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete explained how the new rules would work.\n\n\"We have a system of transparency, we have a system of reporting, we have rules to measure our emissions, we have a system to measure the impacts of our policies compared to what science recommends.\"\n\nTo keep everyone in check, the rules will also contain a compliance mechanism, which means that countries that don't submit their reports on time will face an inquiry.\n\nThe new regulations are \"flexible\" for developing countries, meaning they can sign up to the rules at a later date.\n\n2. Science is worth fighting for\n\nOne of the biggest rows at this meeting was over a key scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nA group of countries including Saudi Arabia, US, Kuwait and Russia refused to \"welcome\" the IPCC study.\n\nThey merely wanted to \"note\" the contents.\n\nImage copyright Kiara Worth/IISD/ENB\n\nEfforts to find a compromise ended in failure.\n\nHowever that was not the end of the matter.\n\nThe vast majority of countries felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference.\n\nTheir efforts did finally ensure that the IPCC was recognised - but many felt it was a token effort.\n\n\"That science is unsettling and it doesn't connect it to the need to do more,\" said Camilla Born from the environmental think tank E3G.\n\n\"The deal looks at it in isolation, it's an elegant compromise but it's not really enough.\"\n\n3. International spirit is still alive\n\nMany countries had worried that with the rise of nationalism in many countries and the recent election of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's president, the international co-operation needed to tackle climate change might be in danger.\n\nFor many getting agreement here in Katowice was less about technical rules and more about showing that the international spirit is still alive and has teeth.\n\n\"I think the beauty of multilateralism is that it is the effort of everybody,\" said Spanish Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera.\n\n\"And what we have seen is that everybody has supported the package, no single country has decided to step down.\n\n\"It is very difficult.

He had a degree in private law and had worked in commercial companies, but had only been part of the royal court for a few months.\n\nWhile analysts scrutinised the young minister of defence, Prince Mohammed made his first decisive move - one still being dissected today.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, the crown prince launched Operation Decisive Storm against Yemen's Houthi rebels, turning the conflict into a devastating war that has killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed cities built hundreds of years ago.\n\nPrince Mohammed - known by his initials MBS - then brought the war home, arresting powerful princes and businessmen and holding them for months until they agreed to his diktats.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump arrived at the White House in early 2017, the young prince became more assured about his political future.\n\nBurning the Gulf\n\nOn June 5, 2017, MBS, 33, set fire to the Gulf Cooperation Council by declaring a blockade on Qatar - with the support of Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAt the same time the crown prince began an internal battle on the House of Saud. He turned against his cousin - the then crown prince and interior minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef - who is widely regarded for his knowldge of security affairs.\n\nAfter seizing the role from Nayef, Prince Mohammed launched a crackdown on alleged corruption against prominent Saudis.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri was also detained during a visit to Saudi Arabia, plunging the two countries into a deep diplomatic crisis. Hariri was allegedly forced to resign while being held in the kingdom. The drama only ended when French President Emmanuel Macaron flew to Riyadh and apparently negotiated Hariri's release.\n\nPrince Mohammed has since been preoccupied with internal affairs related to strengthening his own influence in the country. Meanwhile, he has left the task of the war in Yemen to his armed forces and responsibility for securing the kingdom from Houthi incursions to the Sudanese army.\n\nFor more than three years, Saudi Arabia has imposed a deadly siege on Yemen.\n\nMore than 20 million people require food aid as hunger has become rampant across the country and a cholera outbreak led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 people, mostly women and children. The UN says Yemen has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhen Prince Mohammed's polices began to displease some Saudis, he decided to silence the most prominent intellectuals and activists by imprisoning scores of them.\n\n181207124452605\n\nIsrael and cinemas\n\nAccording to analysts, Prince Mohammed has relied on three pillars to maintain his power: his proximity to Israel, his financial generosity towards Trump, and his launching of a series of reforms in the kingdom, such as building cinemas and allowing women to drive.\n\nOn several occasions, Riyadh has managed to avoid UN resolutions that condemned its role in Yemen despite the war causing the deaths of more than 85,000 Yemeni children under the age of five.\n\nDuring a trip to Washington earlier this year, the prince met with leaders of the Jewish lobby and reportedly assured them of his intention to consolidate bilateral relations with Israel.\n\nWhile in the United States, public relations firms on the payroll were active in whitewashing MBS' image, attempting to distract people from the plight of Yemen's people, while focusing on the prince's openness towards opening cinemas and having concerts in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut MBS did not make good use of this high-priced PR.\n\nOn October 2, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul for a document to complete his marriage to a Turkish woman who waited for him outside. He would never be seen again.\n\nKhashoggi was met by a Saudi assassination team, including some of Prince Mohammed's top security aides. They killed and dismembered the journalist while listening to music.\n\nAfter weeks of denials, Saudi Arabia eventually admitted that Khashaggi was killed and dismembered but vehemently denied the involvement of the crown prince.\n\nInstead, Saudi Arabia announced the arrest of several \"rogue\" actors who had taken matters into their own hands when they killed the Washington Post writer.\n\n181121183052900\n\nWhitewashing\n\nBut the denial of Riyadh and Trump's defence of Prince Mohammed did not convince the US Congress or Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAnd so Prince Mohammed began looking for a way out of the distrastrous war in Yemen.\n\nLast Thursday, the Saudi-Emirati-backed government and Houthi rebels reached a ceasefire in the Red Sea city of Hodeidah after week-long talks in the Swedish city of Stockholm under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nThe Saudis immediately tried to turn the agreement into a victory for Prince Mohammed, portraying him as a champion of peace.\n\nRefutation and cynicism\n\nYemeni Abdul Rahman Abu Talib condemned Saudi Arabia's attempt to transform a defeat into a victory, saying: \"They were vowing to expel the Houthis, but they ended up boasting about victory amid the negotiations that are yet to see the Houthis leave the port.\"\n\nDespite the efforts of Trump adviser Jared Kushner to change the perception of Mohammed bin Salman, many are not convinced of his portrayal as a man of peace.\n\nOn Friday, Erdogan stepped up his rhetoric against Riyadh saying the Saudis know who ordered Khashoggi's murder yet are refusing to hand them over.\n\nIn the US Congress, the Senate adopted two resolutions: one confirming that Mohammed bin Salman authorised Khashoggi's killing, and a second calling for an end to arming and supporting him in Yemen.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the fallout from the Saudi crown prince's actions come back to haunt him."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Hong Kong's bamboo: Project gives material new purpose", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/hong-kongs-bamboo-project-material-purpose-181216165056133.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Bamboo is synonymous with Hong Kong's ever-growing skyline and has been an integral part of the building industry for centuries.\n\nHowever, despite its low cost and eco-friendly nature, local laws were making it irrelevant.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:05", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

There is some concern that Corporate America didn't get the message.\n\n\n\nFor much of the past decade, companies have borrowed at super-low interest rates and used the money to buy back stock, acquire other businesses and refinance old debt. The vast majority of companies are paying their bills on time, thanks in large part to profits that have surged since the economy emerged from the Great Recession nine and a half years ago.\n\n\n\nBut with interest rates rising and U.S. economic growth expected to slow next year, worries are building from Washington to Wall Street that corporate debt is approaching potentially dangerous levels. U.S. corporate debt has grown by nearly two-thirds since 2008 to more than $9 trillion and, along with government debt, has ballooned much faster than other parts of the bond market. Investors are most concerned about companies at the weaker end of the financial-strength scale _ those considered most likely to default or to get downgraded to \"junk\" status should a recession hit.\n\n\n\n\"I've been more worried about the bond market than the equity market,\" said Kirk Hartman, global chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Asset Management. \"I think at some point, all the leverage in the system is going to rear its ugly head.\"\n\n\n\nConsider General Electric, which said in early October it would record a big charge related to its struggling power unit, one that ended up totaling $22 billion. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's subsequently downgraded GE's credit rating to three notches above \"speculative\" grade, which indicates a higher risk of default.\n\n\n\nGE, with about $115 billion in total borrowings, is part of a growing group of companies concentrated at the lower end of investment-grade. Other high-profile names in this area within a few notches of junk grade include General Motors and Verizon Communications. They make up nearly 45 percent of the Bloomberg Barclays Credit index, more than quadruple their proportion during the early 1970s.\n\n\n\nCredit-rating agencies say downgrades for GE, GM or Verizon aren't imminent. But the concern for them, and broadly for this swelling group of businesses, is if profits start falling or the economy hits a recession.\n\n\n\nIf those companies do drop below investment grade, they'd be what investors call \"fallen angels,\" and they can trigger waves of selling. Many mutual funds and other investors are required to own only high-quality, investment-grade bonds \u2014 so they would have to sell any bonds that get cut to junk.\n\n\n\nThe forced selling would lead to a drop in bond prices, which could result in higher borrowing costs for companies, which hurts their ability to repay their debts, which could lead to even more selling.\n\n\n\nEven the chairman of the Federal Reserve has taken notice of the rise in corporate debt. Jerome Powell said in a recent speech that business borrowing usually rises when the economy is growing. But he said it's concerning that, over the last year, the companies increasing their borrowing the most are those already with high debt and interest burdens.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, many bond fund managers say companies were smart to borrow hefty sums at low rates. And at the moment, there are no outward signs of danger. The default rate for junk-rated corporate bonds was 2.6 percent last month, which is lower than the historical average, and S&P Global Fixed Income Research expects it to fall in upcoming months.\n\n\n\nEven if the economy does fall into a recession, fund managers say losses won't be to the same scale as 2008 when the financial crisis sent the S&P 500 to a drop of nearly 37 percent and the most popular category of bond funds to an average loss of 4.7 percent.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Powell said he doesn't see the weaker parts of the corporate debt market undermining the financial system in the event of an economic downturn, at least \"for now.\"\n\n\n\nOther investors see the market's growing worries as premature. Companies are still making record profits, which allow them to repay their debts, and consumer confidence is still high.\n\n\n\n\"There is a story out there that there's a recession coming very soon, and you had better head for the hills,\" said Warren Pierson, deputy chief investment officer at Baird Advisors. \"We think that's a pretty early call. We don't see recession on the horizon.\"\n\n\n\nThat's why he and Mary Ellen Stanek, who run bond mutual funds at Baird, haven't given up on corporate bonds, even if they've moderated how much they own.\n\n\n\nBut critics see some echoes of the financial crisis in today's loosening lending standards. Consider leveraged loans, a section of the market that makes loans to companies with lots of debt or relatively weak finances. These loans have been popular with investors in recent years because they often have what are called floating rates, so they pay more in interest when rates are rising.\n\n\n\nPaul Massaro, portfolio manager for floating-rate strategies at T. Rowe Price, says he's still positive about this market in general. But his team of analysts has been finding more warning flags in offerings, where the terms of the deal may be overly friendly to borrowers and allow them to amass more debt than they should.\n\n\n\nIt's gotten to the point where Massaro is participating in about 15 percent of all offerings today, down from 30 percent a few years ago.\n\n\n\nInvestors have largely been willing to stomach higher risk because they've been starved for income following years of very low interest rates.\n\n\n\nAs a result, some bonds that by many accounts look like risky junk bonds are trading at prices and yields that should be reserved for higher-quality bonds, say Tom McCauley and Yoav Sharon, who run the $976.3 million Driehaus Active Income fund. To take advantage, they're increasingly ``shorting'' corporate bonds, which are trades that pay off if the bonds' prices fall.\n\n\n\nThey recently began shorting bonds of a packaged goods company with a \"BBB\" rating that borrowed to help pay for a large acquisition, for example. A \"BBB\" rating is at the lower end of investment grade, and a drop to \"BB\" would send it into junk status.\n\n\n\nWith so much debt, McCauley and Sharon believe that it's at risk of getting downgraded to junk and is not paying enough in yield to compensate for its risk.\n\n\n\n\"As we get into the later stages of the cycle, the sins of the early stages of the cycle tend to start showing up,\" said Sharon. \"We think that's where we are today.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Pistol-Packing Teachers Becoming More Common in Arkansas", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pistol-packing-teachers-becoming-more-common-in-arkansas/4702703.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:09", "body_paragraphs": "Dale Cresswell keeps his gun on his hip at all times: in his classroom, at sporting events, whenever he\u2019s at school.\n\nCresswell, head coach to the senior boys\u2019 track and cross-country teams, is one of a small, but growing group of teachers around the United States who are volunteering to carry a weapon. His employer, Heber Springs School District, just came online this semester.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer.

I\u2019m protecting all the other students.\u201d\n\nTests and training\n\nIn order to qualify, Cresswell and other faculty, including administrators and IT professionals who can move around more easily, underwent background checks and psychological tests.

He said that when asked, the students tell him they don\u2019t even notice his gun anymore.\n\n\u200bSandy Hook\n\nWhile there appears to have been no law prohibiting it, guns were rarely carried by teachers in Arkansas schools before a 20-year-old gunman killed 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the northeastern U.S. state of Connecticut in 2012.\n\nThat incident prompted David Hopkins, superintendent of the Clarksville Public Schools in Clarksville, Arkansas, to begin searching for more effective ways to protect his students.\n\n\u201cIt was just so terrible. Something like that, it makes you really pause,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI started getting calls from parents and grandparents asking, \u2018What are you doing to protect our kids?\u2019\u201d\n\nAt that time, Hopkins wondered whether what he had in mind \u2014 arming faculty across each school in the district \u2014 was even legal. Since then, he has counseled other Arkansan schools as they follow suit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we want to be cowboys, but if you stop and think about the reality of someone coming into your business or your school, don\u2019t you want to be prepared?\u201d he asked.\n\nProtecting schools, students\n\nProtecting schools from future shootings has increasingly occupied administrators and lawmakers\u2019 time. Just this year, 113 people were killed or injured in school shootings in the U.S.\n\nAfter the Parkland, Florida, school shooting in February, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson tasked a committee with studying how to prevent future school shootings.\n\nTheir report, released earlier this month, stressed that individual schools need to make decisions for themselves, but recommended that \u201cno campus should ever be without an armed presence when staff and children are attending class or a major extracurricular activity.\u201d\n\nA study published by Vice News in March found that at least 14 of the 50 states arm teachers and another 16 allow local school boards to decide on the issue.\n\nBut while Cresswell and Hopkins believe arming teachers serves as a deterrent for gun violence, not everyone agrees.\n\nFollowing the Safety Commission report, Moms Demand Action stated that \u201cputting guns in the hands of teachers is not the answer...\u201d and that \u201cresearch indicates that arming teachers will make children less safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, I don\u2019t think anyone believes that it is preventative.

His employer, Heber Springs School District, just came online this semester.\n\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer. I have a daughter still in school,\u201d said Cresswell of his decision, acknowledging that he might know any potential shooter. \u201cI see it as, I\u2019m protecting more than one person. I\u2019m protecting all the other students.\u201d\n\nTests and training\n\nIn order to qualify, Cresswell and other faculty, including administrators and IT professionals who can move around more easily, underwent background checks and psychological tests. They continue to go through rigorous training.\n\n\u201cI know that last summer there was a big movement here. We were fortunate that we had made the decision early, and we were able to secure trainers and get our time slot locked in,\u201d said Heber Springs School District Superintendent Alan Stauffacher, noting that some other schools are \u201cstruggling\u201d to get set up.\n\nA semester in, the novelty of Cresswell carrying a weapon has worn off. He said that when asked, the students tell him they don\u2019t even notice his gun anymore.\n\n\u200bSandy Hook\n\nWhile there appears to have been no law prohibiting it, guns were rarely carried by teachers in Arkansas schools before a 20-year-old gunman killed 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the northeastern U.S. state of Connecticut in 2012.\n\nThat incident prompted David Hopkins, superintendent of the Clarksville Public Schools in Clarksville, Arkansas, to begin searching for more effective ways to protect his students.\n\n\u201cIt was just so terrible. Something like that, it makes you really pause,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cI started getting calls from parents and grandparents asking, \u2018What are you doing to protect our kids?\u2019\u201d\n\nAt that time, Hopkins wondered whether what he had in mind \u2014 arming faculty across each school in the district \u2014 was even legal. Since then, he has counseled other Arkansan schools as they follow suit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we want to be cowboys, but if you stop and think about the reality of someone coming into your business or your school, don\u2019t you want to be prepared?\u201d he asked.\n\nProtecting schools, students\n\nProtecting schools from future shootings has increasingly occupied administrators and lawmakers\u2019 time.

Meanwhile a state-court judge Friday derided the upcoming ban as an \u201cair ball\u201d that can\u2019t stop doctors from providing pregnancy-ending pills to patients they don\u2019t see in person.\n\nAn abortion rights group seeking an order to block the ban found its request enmeshed in larger legal battles over abortion. Attorneys for the state raised the question of whether other state laws might block telemedicine abortions, and District Judge Franklin Theis held off on issuing an order.\n\n\u200bSuit: Ban unconstitutional\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit last month on behalf of Trust Women of Wichita, which operates a clinic there that performs abortions. Since October, some patients seeking abortion pills have consulted with offsite doctors through teleconferencing, and the clinic hopes to start providing abortion pills to women in rural areas without having them come to Wichita.\n\nThe center argues that the new law violates the state constitution by placing an undue burden on women seeking abortion and singling out abortion for special treatment as part of broader policies otherwise meant to encourage telemedicine.\n\n\u201cThe use of telemedicine right now for medication abortions is extremely important,\u201d said Leah Wiederhorn, an attorney for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for women to access this type of health care during a time when there are a lot of hostile laws that are meant to shut down clinics across the country.\u201d\n\nSeventeen other states have telemedicine abortion bans, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a group that advocates for abortion rights. The new Kansas law says that in policies promoting telemedicine, \u201cnothing\u201d authorizes \u201cany abortion procedure via telemedicine.\u201d\n\nBut Theis said the law doesn\u2019t give a prosecutor any avenue for pursuing a criminal case. While the state medical board could act against the clinic\u2019s doctors, the judge added, \u201cThere\u2019s no jeopardy yet.\u201d\n\nFew clinics\n\nKansas has no clinics providing abortions outside Wichita and the Kansas City area. The Republican-controlled Legislature has strong anti-abortion majorities, and the state has tightened restrictions over the past decade.\n\nLawmakers have tried three times to ban telemedicine abortions. In 2011, a ban was part of legislation imposing special regulations on abortion clinics that critics said were meant to shut them down. Providers sued and Theis blocked all of the regulations. The case is still pending.\n\nLegislators passed a law in 2015 requiring a doctor to be in the same room when a woman takes the first of two abortion pills. The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that it\u2019s covered by the 2011 lawsuit over clinic regulations and has been blocked by Theis. Though the judge said he\u2019s inclined to agree, state attorneys argued that it is in effect, even if it hasn\u2019t been enforced.\n\nThe anti-abortion group Kansans for Life filed a complaint Friday against the Wichita clinic with the state medical board, asking it to investigate its \u201cillegal\u201d telemedicine abortions. Jeanne Gawdun, the group\u2019s senior lobbyist, called them \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s that important physician-patient relationship?\u201d Gawdun said. \u201cIt\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\n\u200bFew complications\n\nA study of abortions in California, published in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\u2019 journal in 2015, said less than one-third of 1 percent of medication abortions resulted in major complications.\n\nThe Kansas health department has reported that in 2017, nearly 4,000 medication abortions were reported, or 58 percent of the state\u2019s total, all in the first trimester. It\u2019s not clear if any were telemedicine abortions.\n\nWiederhorn said banning telemedicine abortion would be a hardship for the clinic\u2019s patients because its doctors, while licensed in Kansas, are outside the state and can spend only two days a week in Wichita. Also, many women in rural areas would face hardships in getting medication abortions without telemedicine, she said.\n\nBut Assistant Attorney General Shon Qualseth said: \u201cWe\u2019re just theorizing on what could happen.\u201d\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Late Guatemalan Girl Dreamed of Sending Money to Family", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/late-guatemalan-girl-dreamed-of-sending-money-to-family/4702661.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:10", "body_paragraphs": "The 7-year-old Guatemalan migrant girl who died in U.S. custody this month was inseparable from her father and had looked forward to being able to send money home to support her impoverished family, relatives said Saturday.\n\nNery Caal, 29, and his daughter Jakelin Caal Maquin were in a group of more than 160 migrants who turned themselves in to U.S. border agents in New Mexico on Dec. 6. Jakelin developed a high fever and died two days later while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.\n\n\n\n\"The girl said when she was grown up she was going to work and send dough back to her mom and grandma,\" said her mother, Claudia Maquin, who has three remaining children, speaking in the Mayan language Q'eqchi' and betraying little outward emotion.\n\n\"Because she'd never seen a big country, she was really happy that she was going to go,\" she added, explaining how her husband had gone to the United States to find a way out of the \"extreme poverty\" that dictated their lives.\n\n\n\nCorn stood behind her palm-thatched wooden house, and there were a few chickens and pigs in the yard. The mother was dressed in a traditional blouse and held a 6-month-old baby in her arms.\n\nA family photograph at the house showed Jakelin smiling and looking up at the camera, wearing a pink T-shirt with characters from the cartoon series Masha and the Bear.\n\nHard lives\n\n\n\nDeforestation to make way for palm oil plantations has made subsistence farming increasingly hard for the 40,000 inhabitants of Raxruha municipality, where the family's agricultural hamlet of San Antonio de Cortez lies in central Guatemala, local officials said. That has spurred an exodus of migrants.\n\nSetting out on Dec. 1, Caal and his daughter traveled more than 2,000 miles (3,220 km) so Jakelin's father could look for work in the United States, said her mother, who learned of the girl's death from consular officials.\n\n\n\nAlmost 80 percent of Guatemala's indigenous population is poor, with half of those people living in extreme poverty. The mayor of San Antonio de Cortez described the Caal family as among the worst off in the village.\n\n\n\nMayor Cesar Castro said in recent months that more and more families were uprooting to try to reach the United States, often selling what little land they owned to pay people traffickers thousands of dollars for the trip.\n\n\"It's not just the Caal family. There are endless people who are leaving,\" Castro said. \"I see them drive past in pickups, cars and buses.\" He said most of them came back in the end, often penniless after being dropped off by traffickers, caught by authorities and deported.\n\n\n\nJakelin's death has added to criticism of U.S. of President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies from migrant advocates and Democrats in the U.S. Congress.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government defended Jakelin's treatment, and said there was no indication she had any medical problems until several hours after she and her father were taken into custody.\n\n\n\nInseparable\n\n\n\nDomingo Caal, Jakelin's grandfather, said she had gone on the journey because she did not want to leave her father.\n\n\n\n\"The girl really stuck to him. It was very difficult to separate them,\" said Domingo, 61, wearing muddy boots and a faded and torn blue shirt.\n\nJakelin's uncle, Jose Manuel Caal, said he had heard she was ill before she died, but he had expected her to recover. \"The girl's death left us in shock,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe family hopes the girl's father can remain in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"What I want now is for Nery to stay and work in the United States. That's what I want,\" said his wife.\n\n\n\nA Guatemalan consular official told Reuters on Friday that Caal told him he had crossed the border planning to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, and would try to stay.\n\n\n\nRecord numbers of parents traveling with children are being apprehended trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. In November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers detained 25,172 members of \"family units,\" the highest monthly number ever recorded, the agency said.\n\n\n\nParents with children are more likely to be released by U.S. authorities while their cases are processed because of legal restrictions on keeping children in detention.\n\n\n\nCaal remains in the El Paso, Texas, area, where his daughter died after being flown by helicopter to a hospital there for emergency treatment when she stopped breathing.\n\n\n\nA brain scan revealed swelling and Jakelin was diagnosed with liver failure. She died early in the morning on Dec. 8, with her father at the hospital, a CBP official said.\n\n\n\nU.S. authorities are investigating the death."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Lawmakers to Visit Detention Site in Wake of Girl's Death", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/lawmakers-to-visit-detention-site-in-wake-of-girl-s-death/4702655.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:11", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. lawmakers will travel to New Mexico in the coming week as they search for answers about how a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died while in federal custody.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus said Friday that it would lead a delegation on Dec. 18 to Lordsburg Station in Lordsburg, N.M., the detention center Jakelin Caal Maquin was en route to, along with her father and scores of other migrants detained with them on the night of Dec. 6, after being taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nJakelin died in an El Paso, Texas, hospital 27 hours later of what medical officials preliminarily determined to be \"sepsis shock,\" according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Her official cause of death has not yet been released.\n\nSymptoms of sepsis, or septic shock, can include extremes in body temperature, lethargy and restlessness.

Joaquin Castro of Texas, chairman-elect of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement Friday that included an open invitation to lawmakers to join the visit. \"We must understand what led to this child's death and how these stations are equipped to protect the health and safety of those seeking refuge at our borders.\"\n\n\n\nJakelin crossed into the U.S. with her father, Nery Caal, 29, after traveling from Raxruha in Alta Verapaz, northern Guatemala.

However, there may have been a language barrier.\n\n\n\nCBP said border agents provided Spanish interpretation to fill out the English-language form. However, a Guatemalan official in Texas told Univision that Jakelin's father is a native speaker of the Mayan language of Ke'chi, also called Q'eqchi'.\n\nThe Guatemalan press also reported on the potential language problem. A consular official told El Pais that Caal said he \"doesn't fully understand Spanish\" and has received consular services in Q'eqchi'.\n\n\n\nIt can be challenging for U.S. personnel to find Q'eqchi' interpreters even during normal business hours, a DHS staffer with experience interviewing Guatemalan migrants told VOA on condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\n\"It's a difficult thing,\" the staffer said, describing the need to schedule \"relay interviews\" with a Q'eqchi' interpreter who interprets to Spanish, then a Spanish interpreter who speaks in English to the U.S. government employee, a process that often involved a full 24 hours of planning.\n\n\n\nMore questions than answers\n\n\n\nThe girl's death on Dec. 8 was not initially made public by CBP or DHS. The Washington Post first reported the story on Dec. 13.\n\nSince then, the agencies have made several public comments and provided a timeline about the events leading to Jakelin's death.

Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan and acting DHS Inspector General John V. Kelly raised the issue of why CBP did not report the death of an individual in its custody within 24 hours as required.\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers requested, in part, details and a full investigation into Jakelin's death, as well as a meeting with the commissioner.\n\n\n\nMcAleenan testified before Congress this week but made no mention of the death."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Research Looks at Natural Fertilizer for Greener Agriculture, Cleaner Water", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/recycling-urine-as-fertilizer-cuts-waste-cleans-water/4702701.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:11", "body_paragraphs": "Fertilizer is made of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

Fierce disagreements on two other climate issues were kicked down the road for a year to help bridge a chasm of opinions on the best solutions.\n\n\n\nThe deal agreed upon at U.N. climate talks in Poland enables countries to put into action the principles in the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\n\n\n\"Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,'' said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official chairing the talks.\n\n\n\nHe said while each individual country would likely find some parts of the agreement it didn't like, efforts had been made to balance the interests of all parties.\n\n\n\n\"We will all have to give in order to gain,'' he said. \"We will all have to be courageous to look into the future and make yet another step for the sake of humanity.''\n\n\n\nThe talks in Poland took place against a backdrop of growing concern among scientists that global warming on Earth is proceeding faster than governments are responding to it. Last month, a study found that global warming will worsen disasters such as the deadly California wildfires and the powerful hurricanes that have hit the United States this year.\n\nOverhaul of global economy\n\n\n\nAnd a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, concluded that while it's possible to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times, this would require a dramatic overhaul of the global economy, including a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nAlarmed by efforts to include this in the final text of the meeting, oil-exporting nations the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked an endorsement of the IPCC report midway through this month's talks in Katowice. That prompted an uproar from vulnerable countries like small island nations and environmental groups.\n\nThe final text at the U.N. talks omits a previous reference to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the \"timely completion'' of the IPCC report, not its conclusions.\n\n\n\nLast-minute snags forced negotiators in Katowice to go into extra time, after Friday's scheduled end of the conference had passed without a deal.\n\n\n\nOne major sticking point was how to create a functioning market in carbon credits. Economists believe that an international trading system could be an effective way to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and raise large amounts of money for measures to curb global warming.\n\n\n\nBut Brazil wanted to keep the piles of carbon credits it had amassed under an old system that developed countries say wasn't credible or transparent.\n\nPush from U.S.\n\n\n\nAmong those that pushed back hardest was the United States, despite President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and promote the use of coal.\n\n\n\n\"Overall, the U.S. role here has been somewhat schizophrenic \u2014 pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,'' said Elliot Diringer of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Washington think tank.\n\n\n\nWhen it came to closing potential loopholes that could allow countries to dodge their commitments to cut emissions, \"the U.S. pushed harder than nearly anyone else for transparency rules that put all countries under the same system, and it's largely succeeded.''\n\n\"Transparency is vital to U.S. interests,'' added Nathaniel Keohane, a climate policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund. He noted that the breakthrough in the 2015 Paris talks happened only after the U.S. and China agreed on a common framework for transparency.\n\n\n\n\"In Katowice, the U.S. negotiators have played a central role in the talks, helping to broker an outcome that is true to the Paris vision of a common transparency framework for all countries that also provides flexibility for those that need it,'' said Keohane, calling the agreement \"a vital step forward in realizing the promise of the Paris accord.''\n\n\n\nAmong the key achievements in Katowice was an agreement on how countries should report their greenhouses gas emissions and the efforts they're taking to reduce them. Poor countries also secured assurances on getting financial support to help them cut emissions, adapt to inevitable changes such as sea level rises and pay for damages that have already happened.\n\nSome not hearing alarms\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the rulebook for the Paris Agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,'' said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. \"But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up to the urgent call of the IPCC report'' on the dire consequences of global warming.\n\n\n\nBut a central feature of the Paris Agreement \u2014 the idea that countries will ratchet up their efforts to fight global warming over time \u2014 still needs to be proved effective, he said.\n\n\n\n\"To bend the emissions curve, we now need all countries to deliver these revised plans at the special U.N. secretary-general summit in 2019. It's vital that they do so,'' Adow said.\n\n\n\nIn the end, a decision on the mechanics of an emissions trading system was postponed to next year's meeting. Countries also agreed to consider the issue of raising ambitions at a U.N. summit in New York next September.\n\n\n\nSpeaking hours before the final gavel, Canada's Environment Minister Catherine McKenna suggested there was no alternative to such meetings if countries want to tackle global problems, especially at a time when multilateral diplomacy is under pressure from nationalism.\n\n\n\n\"The world has changed, the political landscape has changed,'' she told The Associated Press. \"Still, you're seeing here that we're able to make progress, we're able to discuss the issues, we're able to come to solutions.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Republicans Say Little About Obamacare Ruling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-say-little-about-obamacare-ruling/4702322.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:12", "body_paragraphs": "Republican lawmakers have been mostly silent on Friday\u2019s court ruling that the Affordable Care Act, known commonly as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.

Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who will assume the speaker's role next year, said the House \"will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the lifesaving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans' effort to destroy'' the law.\n\nU.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas ruled Friday that a change in tax law last year eliminating a penalty for not having health insurance invalidated the entire ACA. The decision is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the ACA will remain the law during the appeal.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had promised during his presidential campaign to dismantle the ACA, a program that made affordable health insurance available to millions of Americans.\n\n'Great news'\n\nThe president took to Twitter Friday night: \"Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the judge's decision \"vindicates President Trump's position that Obamacare is unconstitutional. Once again, the President calls on Congress to replace Obamacare and act to protect people with pre-existing conditions and provide Americans with quality, affordable health care.\"\n\nAmericans with pre-existing conditions, before ACA, faced either high premiums or an inability to access health insurance at all.\n\nSchumer said in a statement Friday that the ruling \u201cseems to be based on faulty legal reasoning, and hopefully it will be overturned. Americans who care about working families must do all they can to prevent this district court ruling from becoming law.\"\n\n\"Today's misguided ruling will not deter us,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, the leader of an alliance of states opposing the lawsuit, said in a statement Friday. \"Our coalition will continue to fight in court for the health and well-being for all Americans.\"\n\nNew law unlikely for now\n\nSome legal observers believe Congress is unlikely to pass a new law while the case is in the courts. Many senior Republican lawmakers have said they did not plan to also strike down provisions such as pre-existing condition coverage when they repealed the law's fines for people who can afford coverage but remain uninsured.\n\nIf the case reaches the Supreme Court, it would be the third time the high court considers a challenge to ACA provisions. The law's opponents lost the first two cases.\n\nPolls have regularly shown wide public support for the guarantee of health insurance coverage regardless of pre-existing health conditions, an issue Democrats successfully leveraged in last month's midterm elections to win control of the House of Representatives."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Research Looks at Natural Fertilizer for Greener Agriculture, Cleaner Water", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/recycling-urine-as-fertilizer-cuts-waste-cleans-water/4702701.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:12", "body_paragraphs": "Fertilizer is made of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

His identity has not been released, but on Friday, he appeared before an investigating judge in a closed hearing and was ordered detained for two more weeks while the investigation continues.\n\nIn her Dec. 6 text messages to Pryor, Papenheim was unhappy and was venting about working full time and attending school full time.

Papenheim, a 21-year-old psychology student at Erasmus University, was fatally stabbed at her home on Wednesday.\n\nPapenheim\u2019s mother, Donee Odegard, told the Star Tribune in Minneapolis that the suspect arrested was her daughter\u2019s roommate and that he reportedly had been \u201cgetting more and more angry\u201d in recent weeks.\n\nOdegard said her daughter was studying psychology with a focus on suicide; Sarah\u2019s brother took his own life three years ago. Amid concerns about the suspect\u2019s mental health, Odegard told her daughter: \u201d\u2018Get out of there,\u2019 but she wouldn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d she told the Star Tribune.\n\nPapenheim was a drummer in the Minneapolis blues scene. Pryor, a 19-year-old keyboardist, said he and Papenheim met at a jam session a few years ago and immediately connected because of their young ages and love of music.\n\n\u201cMost people my age don\u2019t know what blues music is, much less can play it and much less can play like she did,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just so special in so many ways.\u201d\n\nPryor said Papenheim was naturally gifted and had book smarts and street smarts, and the death of her brother was always on her mind. Pryor said Papenheim also had a big heart and tried to help everyone she could. She loved the Minneapolis music scene and it hurt her to be away from it.\n\nPryor recalled one moment last summer when the two were at a show at a Minneapolis venue. Papenheim was called on stage to play with some of the biggest names in town, and although she was nervous, \u201cshe went up there and just nailed it.\u201d Pryor said that was a big moment for Papenheim, who was shaking with excitement afterward.\n\nPryor, who studies electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Papenheim\u2019s slaying hasn\u2019t really hit him yet, but when he tries to listen to music, memories of her come flooding back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this is real.\u201d\n\nIn Rotterdam, tributes including flowers and candles were left inside Papenheim\u2019s apartment building. Erasmus University said it was shocked by her death and expressed condolences to her family and friends.\n\nFikret Egemen, the owner of a kebab restaurant where Papenheim worked part time, fought back tears as he recalled how she immediately fit into his team when she started working for him in September.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, she picked up everything. She was like family,\u201d he said. \u201cShe always worked with a smile, all day long, no problem.

For Trump, the political, the personal and the deeply personal are all under examination.\n\nLess than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, his business associates, political advisers and family members are being probed, along with the practices of his late father. On Saturday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke became the fourth Cabinet member to leave under an ethical cloud, having sparked 17 investigations into his actions on the job, by one watchdog\u2019s count.\n\nAll of this with the first special counsel investigation against a president in 20 years hanging over Trump\u2019s head, spinning out charges and strong-arming guilty pleas from underlings while keeping in suspense whether the president \u2014 \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s coded legalese \u2014 will end up accused of criminal behavior himself.\n\nThe scope of the scrutiny has shaped Trump\u2019s presidency, proving a steady distraction from his governing agenda. So far, much of it has been launched by federal prosecutors and government watchdogs that eschew partisanship. The intensity is certain to increase next year when Democrats assume control of the House and the subpoena power that comes with it.\n\nAlthough Trump dismisses the investigations as politically motivated \u201cwitch hunts,\u201d his high-octane Twitter account frequently betrays just how consumed he is by the scrutiny. He\u2019s also said to watch hours of television coverage on milestone days in the investigations.\n\n\u201cIt saps your energy, diverts your attention and you simply can\u2019t lead because your opponents are up in arms against you,\u201d Cal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University political scientist and historian, said of the scrutiny. \u201cIt weakens your friends and emboldens your enemies.\u201d\n\nAlmost midway through his term, Trump is struggling to deliver on his central campaign promises. He may end the year without a Republican-led Congress giving him the $5 billion he wants for a border wall. And he\u2019s previewed few legislative priorities for 2019.\n\nEven if he had, it\u2019s unlikely the new Democratic House majority would have much incentive to help a president weakened by investigations rack up wins as his own re-election campaign approaches.\n\nPerhaps not since Bill Clinton felt hounded by a \u201cvast right wing conspiracy,\u201d as Hillary Clinton put it, has a president been under such duress from investigation.\n\nThis jeopardy has come with Trump\u2019s party in control of Congress and the Justice Department driving at least three separate criminal investigations. They are the Mueller probe looking into possible collusion, obstruction of justice or other wrongdoing in contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia; the New York campaign-finance case involving hush money paid to Trump\u2019s alleged lovers; and now a case from New York, first reported by The Wall Street Journal this past week, examining the finances and operations of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and whether foreign interests made illegal payments to it.\n\nBehind those matters is a battery of lawsuits or inquiries from state attorneys general and other parties tied mainly to Trump businesses.\n\nAt best, the investigations are overshadowing what has been positive economic news. At worst, the probes are a threat to the presidency, Trump\u2019s family and his business interests.\n\nThe deep diving will only grow in the new year when Democrats take over the House. They are expected to launch their own investigations and could pursue impeachment, though party leaders caution they could face a political backlash by taking that step.\n\nEven if Trump avoids impeachment, the Democratic investigations will create headaches. Administration officials will be called to testify before Congress and lawmakers will seek a trove of documents, probably including Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has refused to make public.\n\nA bare-bones White House staff may struggle to keep up. A tally by the Brookings Institution finds more than 60 percent of Trump\u2019s top aides have left in the first two years, a turnover rate exceeding the previous five presidents. In addition, 10 Cabinet secretaries have departed, more than Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton lost in two years. The shake-ups now have left Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget chief, doing double duty indefinitely as the president\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nThat combination makes it hard to imagine a president effectively engaged in policy, even if \u2014 as in the case of Clinton \u2014 the drawn-out investigations lead to an impeachment that fails to remove the president.\n\n\u201cThe modern presidency is extraordinarily complex and demanding so you need the president\u2019s full attention,\u201d Jillson says. \u201cWhere your attention should be, you\u2019re also thinking about meeting with your lawyers.\u201d\n\nAs the investigations mount, few Republicans have dissociated themselves publicly from Trump. But privately, some lawmakers do worry that the investigations will damage his re-election prospects and their own chances in 2020 House and Senate races.\n\nThe federal campaign finance probe has put GOP lawmakers in a particularly awkward position. Prosecutors \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen and a tabloid company that has long been an ally \u2014 assert that Trump directed hush payments to keep women quiet about alleged affairs in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign. Such a payment would violate campaign finance laws. Cohen was sentenced this past week to three years in prison.\n\nUnderscoring the balancing act for Republicans, outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah initially stated that he didn\u2019t much care about Trump being implicated in Cohen\u2019s crime, then thought better of his words.\n\n\u201cI made comments about allegations against the president that were irresponsible and a poor reflection on my lengthy record of dedication to the rule of law,\u201d Hatch said in a statement Friday.\n\nFive people in Trump\u2019s orbit have pleaded guilty to charges in the continuing Mueller probe. Among them, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, for a time in Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. George Papadopoulos, a lower-level campaign adviser, was sentenced to 14 days in prison and is out. The others are Michael Flynn, who was Trump\u2019s first national security adviser in office and is to be sentenced Tuesday, and Cohen, who is expected to begin his sentence in March.\n\nIn addition, the special counsel\u2019s office says Flynn, in giving 19 interviews and turning over a mountain of documents, has assisted in a criminal investigation that has yet to be revealed.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no end in sight.\n\nTrump is also exposed to legal peril beyond that from federal prosecutors. Among the lawsuits or investigations:\n\n\u2014Democratic attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia and congressional Democrats are challenging the Trump Organization\u2019s business transactions with foreign and state government interests, such as those at his Washington hotel, citing the constitutional ban on presidents taking payments from such sources without congressional consent.\n\n\u2014Summer Zervos, once a contestant on Trump\u2019s TV show, has sued Trump for defamation for accusing her of lying. She alleged in 2016 that he made unwelcome physical contact with her. He\u2019s failed several times to derail the case.\n\n\u2014New York tax officials are looking into whether Trump or his charitable foundation misrepresented tax liability. In addition, the New York tax department said it is \u201cvigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation\u201d after a New York Times report found Trump and his family, going back to transactions by his father, Fred Trump, cheated on taxes for decades. The report said Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father, much of it through dubious tax maneuvers. Trump called the report \u201ca very old, boring and often told hit piece on me.\u201d\n\n\u2014New York authorities allege in a lawsuit that Trump illegally tapped his charitable Trump Foundation to settle legal disputes, help his campaign for president and cover personal and business expenses, including the purchase of a life-size portrait of himself for $10,000.\n\nStanley Renshon, political scientist at the City University of New York and a psychoanalyst, says all of that adds up to a lot of people, not just the left, \u201ctrying to make his presidency untenable.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Whines Over 'Unfair' Coverage On NBC, 'Saturday Night Live'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-saturday-night-live-tweet_us_5c165bbde4b05d7e5d82ef67", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:17", "body_paragraphs": "Sounds like President Donald Trump didn\u2019t enjoy this weekend\u2019s episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nThe president on Sunday blasted NBC and its iconic sketch comedy show as \u201cspin machines.\u201d He questioned the legality of what he called \u201cunfair news coverage\u201d on certain TV networks \u2015 a baseless claim that appeared to fly in the face of First Amendment protections.\n\n\u201cA REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC & Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIt is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials.

A seat belt can\u2019t guarantee your child\u2019s safety in 100 percent of accidents. But would you ever not buckle them in?\n\nIt\u2019s about trying to prevent the worst, she says. Flu vaccines are typically 40 to 60 percent effective, but when they work, they can \u2014 like seat belts \u2014 potentially mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not perfect \u2015 but we know it is going to significantly reduce our risk of hospitalization and death and also our chance of illness,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people get hung up on that vaccine effectiveness number, but if you don\u2019t get the vaccine, you have zero protection against the flu.\u201d\n\nShe speaks from painful experience: Her son Joseph died during the 2009 swine flu pandemic after coming down with H1N1 before the H1N1 flu vaccine was on the market that year. The last thing they talked about was what he wanted to wear for Halloween.\n\nMuch More Than \u201cJust A Bad Cold\u201d\n\nThe flu, and its vaccine, are often underestimated, Dr. Lynnette Brammer, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s domestic flu surveillance team, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cI think people don\u2019t always really realize how severe influenza can be,\u201d she said, citing how many don\u2019t believe her that 80,000 people died in the U.S. alone last year \u2015 they think it\u2019s a global statistic. \u201cA lot of people think flu is just a bad cold.\u201d\n\nAmong that 80,000 figure are the 185 kids who died of the flu. It was the deadliest nonpandemic year on record since the CDC started tracking pediatric flu deaths in 2004. So far this year, six children have died.\n\nOf the kids who die from flu, the majority have no underlying health problems, American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Dr. Geoffrey Simon pointed out.\n\nBut when it comes to the vaccine \u2015 the single most powerful tool in preventing the flu \u2015 questions about its efficacy lead many to eschew getting it all together. Less than half of American adults get vaccinated each year. And an even lower proportion \u2015 under 4 in 10 \u2015 got their flu shot last year, which may have contributed to the high rate of cases and deaths.\n\nWhich is a mistake, Brammer says.\n\n\u201cWe would all love to have a vaccine that works better, but the vaccine that we have does provide protection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even if you get sick, it may protect you from having more severe illness.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly true for children, said Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatric infectious disease at the Baylor College of Medicine. She pointed to a study that shows a reduced risk of death in vaccinated children without underlying conditions.\n\nBut Munoz-Rivas acknowledged how hard it is to ensure kids are vaccinated each year \u2015 parents have to pull kids from school or add this to their to-do list on the weekend. And since there\u2019s no nationwide mandate for kids to get the flu vaccine in order to attend school as there is with other vaccination regimens, it doesn\u2019t always happen. There are exceptions: Connecticut and New Jersey require the flu vaccine for school attendance, while Ohio, Rhode Island and New York City also require it for child care.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 stance is that every child 6 months and older should get immunized.\n\n\u201cWe want it as easy as possible for families to protect their children,\u201d said Simon.\n\nFlu Season Is Far From Over\n\nExperts have been heartened by the preliminary news coming from CVS \u2015 a top flu shot distributor \u2015 which tells HuffPost that it\u2019s seeing a large uptick in flu shots since this time last year.\n\nBut some parents decide that if they\u2019ve missed the push for vaccination in October and before Thanksgiving, then it\u2019s too late and not worth worrying about anymore.\n\nWhile so far this year the flu\u2019s seasonal activity has been muted, there\u2019s a long way to go, Simon said, warning that a pickup is beginning now in December and peaks are usually expected in January and the spring.\n\n\u201cI tell parents it\u2019s never too late to get the flu vaccine,\u201d he said, stressing \u201cthe sooner, the better,\u201d considering it takes about two weeks to fully kick in.

Tisch Center for Women\u2019s Health at NYU Langone. \u201cAnd truly, if you think you have a heart attack, you need to call 911 and not waste time going online to check your symptoms.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Goldberg\u2019s patients. A study released this week by the European Society of Cardiology found that women having a heart attack wait approximately 37 minutes longer than men before contacting medical services. Researchers performed the retrospective analysis on 4,360 patients \u2014 20 percent of whom were women \u2014 treated at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland from 2000 to 2016. (The study did not find that the delay was associated with higher rates of death.)\n\nOne of the reasons women wait longer to call for help is that they don\u2019t know that heart attack symptoms for women are sometimes different from men\u2019s, according to the study\u2019s author and experts interviewed by HuffPost after its release.\n\n\u201cMen often get crushing chest pain. It\u2019s kind of clear. They\u2019ll call for help or go to the ER,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital who works with the American Heart Association\u2019s Go Red for Women initiative. It\u2019s possible for women to experience the classic chest-clutching, arm-numbing signs of heart attack, but sometimes they\u2019re far less obvious. \u201cWomen\u2019s symptoms could be more subtle, like shortness of breath or jaw pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, even flu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nSigns can also include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes and cold sweat, dizziness and weakness.\n\n\u201cThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help,\u201d Steinbaum added.\n\nGoldberg said women might hesitate because they\u2019re worried about looking silly if they show up at the hospital and aren\u2019t having a heart attack. But she and Steinbaum agree that the risk is far too high to ignore the symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe head of my fellowship program used to say, \u2018Remember, time is muscle,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cThe longer you wait, the higher the chance of damaging a bigger part of your heart, and if that happens, the greater chance of really becoming quite sick with heart failure or death.\u201d\n\nThe subtleties of these symptoms sometimes lead women to believe maybe they will feel better soon or it\u2019s going to pass, and they don\u2019t reach out for help.\" Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nDespite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, heart disease has been historically perceived as a man\u2019s disease and has been studied and treated as such.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that women don\u2019t have heart attacks,\u201d said Goldberg. It\u2019s that they differ in women, presenting differently and often later in life. \u201cThe most common time for [women] to have them is about 10 years after menopause, whereas in men, the prime time to have a heart attack is their 40s and 50s.\u201d\n\nHeart attack rates are rising among people ages 35 to 54 \u2015 and those rates are rising faster among women.\n\nAbout 80 percent of cardiovascular disease can be prevented. That is why it\u2019s important to raise awareness about heart disease in women, its prevalence and how it differs from heart disease in men \u2014 not just among patients but among members of the medical and research community as well, where women\u2019s needs aren\u2019t getting the attention they should.\n\nA Women\u2019s Disease Too\n\nDuring her residency, Goldberg once heard a doctor say women don\u2019t get heart disease. Then in 1990 a female patient came in with what she suspected were symptoms of a heart attack. While other doctors told the patient she was likely just stressed, Goldberg wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\nAfter a stress test came back abnormal, she persuaded the patient\u2019s doctors to do further cardiac testing. The patient was found to have a 99 percent blockage in a major heart artery \u2015 on the precipice one of the deadliest types of heart attacks there is.\n\nGoldberg said a lot of advances have been made since then but more has to be done to dispel the myth that heart disease affects mostly men.\n\nGender disparities in diagnosis and treatment are still considered a significant issue. A study published by the American Heart Association in February found that when women sought medical care for heart attack symptoms, 53 percent of the time, their health care providers did not believe their symptoms were health related. That\u2019s compared with 37 percent of men who were told the same thing.\n\nIn August a report from Stony Brook University in New York found that women having a heart attack waited 20 percent longer than men did from the moment they arrived at the hospital to when they began to receive care. That month another study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, showed that women are more likely to survive a heart attack if their cardiologist is a woman.\n\nZinkevych via Getty Images Heart attack symptoms in women can include throat, neck, chest, stomach or shoulder pain that lasts for more than 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become important to understand there are studies that have shown that doctors have really not been as proactive about taking care of their women patients compared to their male patients when it comes to heart disease \u2015 whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re not as aware or perhaps because there is an unconscious gender bias to it,\u201d Steinbaum said.\n\n\u201cI would like to believe in the medical world, [bias] doesn\u2019t exist, but the problem is we are all human beings,\u201d she added.\n\nPart of the problem, Goldberg said, is a lack of female cardiologists, who have thus far led the way when it comes to researching and raising awareness of heart disease in women.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists,\u201d she said. But \u201cwe make up only 12.5 percent of the board-certified cardiologists in our country. And I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d\n\nGiving women the knowledge and language to communicate their symptoms is an important way to overcome possible bias, Goldberg and Steinbaum stressed.\n\n\u201cWomen themselves, they\u2019re not educated about the symptoms. They\u2019re not really good advocates for themselves to even go and say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure, but I might be having a heart issue,\u2019\u201d Steinbaum said. \u201cI think personal advocacy becomes a very, very important part of this.\u201d\n\nThe Knowledge Gap\n\nSteinbaum said the conversation around heart disease began to shift in 1984, when more women began dying of the disease than men.\n\nBefore then, \u201call heart disease research was done on men,\u201d she added. \u201cWomen were just not part of those trials and certainly not part of the major preventive trials. So we\u2019ve gone from not having women in trials to now beginning to study women\u2019s hearts and realizing there is a fundamental difference [between women and men], and we are learning.\u201d\n\nFor instance, it is known that conditions such as diabetes, lack of exercise and cigarette smoking increase both men\u2019s and women\u2019s risk for heart attack. But research has revealed that there are others conditions, including gestational diabetes and autoimmune disease, that can increase the risk of heart disease specifically for women, according to Goldberg.\n\n\u201cA lot of the movement on cardiovascular disease in women has been led by women who are cardiologists. ... I think our male colleagues have to also get involved.\u201d Dr. Nieca Goldber, an expert in female cardiovascular medicine\n\nBoth cardiologists said to learn more about the unique issues in heart disease among women, more research must be done regarding prevention, risk factors, and treatment. Steinbaum said this includes having women represented in clinical trials for pharmaceuticals and devices that are used in treatment and surgery. \u201cWomen\u2019s participation in research studies is only about 20 percent,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nIt\u2019s especially low among black women, who are disproportionately affected by strokes. Almost 50 percent of African-American women ages 20 or older have some form of cardiovascular disease. But Steinbaum said they get less care and are less likely to be involved in clinical trials than white women.\n\n\u201cUnless we have women represented in clinical trials, we won\u2019t have enough information about treatment and diagnosis for women in heart disease,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nNeither she or Steinbaum knows why so few participate in clinical trials, but they hypothesize that at least part of it is that many women are still the primary caretakers for their families and are too busy juggling work, children and more to participate in trials that are time-consuming.\n\n\u201cWe have to make research easier for potential individuals to engage in and give them a better understanding about participation in research and how it will drive important changes in health care in women,\u201d Goldberg said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-16 19:02:19", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.
