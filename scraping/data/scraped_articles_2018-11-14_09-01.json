Melania Trump had already said in an ABC interview last month that she didn't trust some White House staffers. Now, she is doing something about it.\n\nOne person told CNN that, incredibly, Trump, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders had no idea the statement was coming.\n\nIt's not unusual for unease to stalk the White House after a midterm election loss, as staffers exhausted by the first half of the President's mandate give way to fresher troops. And Tuesday was not the first time a first lady has leaned on her husband over a staffer she finds irksome.\n\nBut this President's mercurial temperament and the nest of vipers that is his West Wing has inflicted more nerve-rattling pressure on his staff than is normal even in the White House, where crises are always just around the corner.\n\nSeveral Cabinet members -- including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen -- are being targeted by whispering campaigns, leaks and speculation about their fates as trial balloons float about possible replacements.\n\nKelly, who has survived several rounds of scuttlebutt about his often supposedly imminent departure, is said to be heading for the exit again. And leaked reports that Trump sees Ryan Zinke as vulnerable to Democratic oversight have weakened the Interior secretary's position.\n\nTrump is meanwhile digging in on his constitutionally questionable appointment of Matthew Whitaker, a critic of Robert Mueller, to oversee the special counsel probe as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions was fired.\n\nSanders had been expected to leave, along with her deputy Raj Shah, but their status remains uncertain.\n\nMore than the usual staff turmoil\n\nTrump uses pandemonium as an instrument of personal power, leaving everyone off balance and unsure of what will happen next, while he sits in the center of the storm ready to make his next move.\n\nSowing disruption in Washington, while confounding the political establishment and perceptions of how a White House should be run, allows the President to keep faith with his political base.\n\nSo palace intrigue has been part of the administration from the start, along with media narratives that Trump is running his White House like a reality show and is constantly firing off distractions for reporters to chase.\n\nBut the current turbulence and sense of presidential norms being shattered by an emotional and erratic President feels different than the wild staff intrigues of early in the presidency. It's beginning to raise real questions about what is in store for the nation over the second half of Trump's term.\n\nIt seems certain that Trump will emerge from this highly charged moment with fewer constraints if senior staffers who have tried to keep him within the bounds of presidential custom and the law depart.\n\nHe may have more latitude to follow an unpredictable course in which he sometimes seems to brush up against governing conventions and constitutional guardrails he often doesn't seem to even know are there.\n\nThis could be an increasing problem when the administration faces a sudden burst of investigations from the new Democratic House, a reality for which lax oversight by Republicans has left it deeply underprepared.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nAnd there is a good chance that Trump becomes even more distracted by the Mueller investigation with speculation heating up about possible new indictments and the contents of the special counsel's long awaited final report.\n\nOn Tuesday, with his White House in uproar, he was sitting down with his lawyers to answer written questions posed by Mueller -- a potential critical moment for his presidency.\n\nAmazingly, the President is yet to face a major international crisis that he did not precipitate \u2014 like a close military call with a major adversary or a financial crash, that will require focused, unambiguous leadership and a crack team operating with unity and purpose. That seems an unlikely prospect in this White House.\n\nThere must also be questions, given the ever more fractious nature of life in his administration, whether top-level staffers on the GOP bench who might be persuaded to serve are going to have second thoughts.\n\nAfter all, officials like Nielsen and Kelly have put their own reputations on the line, defending the President's controversial policies on immigration, only for him to turn on them in the end.\n\nRight now, the only White House staffers who might consider themselves safe are his kin: his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nBut the danger of running a West Wing on the nepotistic model of Trump's business has been made clear recently with the crisis over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The assassination, which caused global outrage, is being widely blamed on Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince on whom Kushner -- going around the State Department -- anchored Middle East policy.\n\nMelania Trump shows her power\n\nTuesday's swoop by the first lady was remarkable. In a show of force apparently brewing for days, she made Ricardel's position untenable.\n\nIn a dash of added intrigue, Melania Trump twisted the knife with national security adviser John Bolton, who has forged his own deserved reputation as a ruthless bureaucratic assassin, out of the action -- nearly 10,000 miles away in Singapore.\n\nIt was not the first time a senior West Wing staffer paid the price for falling out with a first lady.\n\nGossip often bubbled over ill will between Nancy Reagan and ex-White House chief of staff Don Regan. George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir about clashes with Hillary Clinton when he served in her husband's White House. And there was often talk of tension between Michelle Obama and her husband's first press secretary, Robert Gibbs.\n\nBut it's hard to find a precedent for the public, categorical, felling of Ricardel by Melania Trump, a strike that exemplified the first lady's willingness to throw around her political weight.\n\nStill, Marc Short, Trump's former congressional liaison, told CNN's Erin Burnett that while her move was unprecedented, it was not likely to start a new trend.\n\n\"I think you will find out over time that this is probably an exception and that the first lady probably had reasons,\" he said.\n\nA source told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that Trump -- who often finds it difficult to fire people in person despite his schtick on NBC's \"The Apprentice\" -- had decided that Ricardel has to go, though she was being given time to clear her desk.\n\nSome White House sources painted a picture of Ricardel as tough to work with and said she had picked a lot of fights since coming aboard in April.\n\n\"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone,\" said another official.\n\nStill, Ricardel has not yet had the chance to tell her own story. And the tone of any White House is set from the top -- and there is no doubt that there a few tougher places to work in America."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Melania Trump's hidden hand just became not so hidden", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/sz0xcpOxg2k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Melania Trump is, without question, the most enigmatic and least-known first lady in modern memory.

(Sidebar: Really? This is solely about a series of clashes during an Africa trip? I mean, OK.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) By all accounts, Mira Ricardel has not made a lot of friends in the Trump administration. A key member of national security adviser John Bolton's team, she was brought in in April to help him shake up the national security staff. In the past, she had butted heads with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly not a fan, two former White House officials told the Washington Post .\n\nNow it appears that she has learned, quite publicly, that the one you really don't want to mess with is the first lady.\n\nIn another episode of \"Survivor: West Wing,\" Melania Trump went public Tuesday with her personnel concerns about Ricardel, in the process undermining the national security staff and -- not to be forgotten -- our national security. Indeed CNN reported Tuesday afternoon that \"a White House official confirmed ... that Trump has told people that Ricardel will be fired, but she has been given some time to clear out her desk.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nThe once private dispute between the first lady, her staff and Ricardel broke into the open this week after news reports that Ricardel had challenged some request from the first lady's office about Melania Trump's recent trip to Africa. CNN reported that a person familiar with the most recent dustup said \"Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.\"\n\nMelania Trump's spokeswoman issued a statement Tuesday that \"(i)t is the position of the office of the first lady that she [Ricardel] no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nSo, let me make a few things clear. First, Ricardel may have been behaving badly regarding the Africa trip; there are some suggestions in news reports that she deliberately withheld national security resources from the first lady's office. Second, Melania Trump has every right to relate her disdain for bad behavior to her husband or Bolton and to ask for a staffer's resignation over not sufficiently respecting the first lady's duties.\n\nBut what is not acceptable, and indeed dangerous, is the extent to which Melania Trump used her status as a family member \u2014 unelected, unappointed and unqualified \u2014 to dictate national security personnel decisions, in public, as if there are no global consequences to such action.\n\nAnd, in this regard, the first lady was acting very -- Trumpish.\n\nThere is a great deal of this sort of behavior in this White House \u2014 the people's house. The President, her husband, wants a military parade (eventually). Jared Kushner, Melania Trump's son-in-law, wants to guide Middle East politics while continuing his business deals with those very same nations.\n\nEarlier in the administration, Ivana Trump, Melania Trump's husband's ex-wife, said she was considered for (and turned down) the post of ambassador to the Czech Republic. And Ivanka Trump, her daughter-in-law, just received initial approval for 16 new trademarks from China, while experts on trade are trying to avoid a tariff war.\n\nAll these are examples where the line between national security and Trump family interest are blurred, if not essentially invisible. There are no American interests for the first family, only Trump personal or financial interests.\n\nAnd there is likely to be more drama poured into the security mix in coming days. Sources in the White House made it clear Tuesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen's days in her job are numbered. And John Kelly, the chief of staff, may also be booted, sources told CNN.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMelania Trump's actions are consistent with the mercurial management preferences of the Trump family; indeed, the President is keen on calling the defense apparatus that exists to protect America \"my generals.\" The family has turned national security -- once, not so long ago, immune from the political backstabbing and favor-grabbing that animate the political side of the White House -- into its own TV-style drama. The first lady felt no need to hide that that was exactly the way she was handling things.\n\nBolton, who hired Ricardel, doesn't have many options. Melania Trump has spoken. This is no longer our national security hard at work to protect the American public. It is a denigration of the career staff and (whether you like him or not) the NSA's Bolton. In public.\n\nDear world, this is America's security apparatus. Fear us? Respect us?

More public engagements, more international tours and daily paperwork that often keeps him at his desk late into the night.\n\nTo mark the prince's birthday, CNN was invited to his Dumfries House estate in Scotland while he was visiting and to West Africa on an official royal tour.\n\nCharles appears to be using his 70th birthday on Wednesday to highlight the work he has done so far as the longest-serving royal heir in British history. By any measure he has used that time to redefine the role, making it a full-time job and expressing himself freely on the issues he cares about. Many of his predecessors saw it as an opportunity to keep a low profile and enjoy the spoils of royalty before taking on the responsibility of the Crown.\n\n\"I think you would easily understand the Prince of Wales if you came here,\" Kenneth Dunsmuir, director of the Prince's Foundation, the umbrella group for Charles' public projects, told CNN standing outside Dumfries House. \"It's very evident you can see very clearly what his work is and the variation of work, the variety that you see on the estate.\"\n\nThe house is best imagined as a fairytale 18th-century mansion at the center of a vast, immaculate estate with outbuildings humming with community activities. There are no gates. Members of the public roam freely and it's not uncommon for them to encounter Charles himself as he goes about his inspections.\n\nThe Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland.\n\nCNN was shown a high-tech science lab nestled among trees, for visiting school groups, and an organic rare-breeds farm where the pigs live in plush, thatched pigsties. In a renovated barn, unemployed adults were learning traditional crafts. All the projects speak to social and ecological issues close to the prince's heart.\n\nThe Prince's Trust is also well represented here with initiatives to support disadvantaged young people and help get them into work -- something desperately needed in nearby towns that have never fully recovered from the collapse of the coal mining industry in the 1980s.\n\nInside the house itself is a priceless collection of furniture bought directly from the cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale in the 1750s by the fifth Earl of Dumfries. The collection contains what's reputed to be the most valuable item of furniture in the world, a cabinet valued by the estate at $30 million. One of the chairs in use during CNN's visit turned out to be worth a million dollars. When asked why such a valuable chair was being treated so casually, a member of staff replied: \"Because they are here to be used.\"\n\nPhotos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Photos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Prince Charles poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Hide Caption 52 of 52\n\nEncouraged by the prince, this un-precious philosophy is what drives the place. It's meant to be a living, breathing project that is not only part of the community but adds to it. Prince Charles stepped in to save the estate from the seventh Marquess of Bute who couldn't afford the upkeep. It was renovated and reopened by the prince as a visitor attraction.\n\nDumfries House is now the second-largest employer in the county, after the local authority, and has even funded a new town hall and outdoor swimming pool in the nearby town of New Cumnock. Every Friday, the prince is sent a report on the estate running to dozens of pages and he returns it with notes the next morning.\n\n\"The signs were there from young adulthood -- his concerns about social issues, community issues and ecological issues,\" Dunsmuir said. \"All that's happened is that he's got more and more involved and has had the time to develop these ideas and take them further, due to the length of time that he's been Prince of Wales. What I'd like to think is that in bringing together so many strands into the Prince's Foundation of his charitable initiatives, that this (Dumfries House) is a fantastic physical legacy of that work that will always be here and always remain.\"\n\nWhile Dumfries House may be the project that best symbolizes Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales, we shouldn't take it as an indication of what sort of king he will be. A senior aide said the prince feels a duty to use his platform now to promote his causes before he becomes head of state. He knows the two roles are distinct and it is \"his clear wish and intention to change his approach in the next role.\"\n\nWithout doubt, he has a lot to live up to. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is revered for the way she has steadily gained popularity during the course of her reign despite the collapse of the British Empire and a general loss of deference in society. She has modernized and stayed relevant by embracing public walkabouts, mass media and charitable work. She has rarely expressed any opinions, let alone political views, so we never know quite what she is thinking.\n\nWe know what the Prince of Wales thinks about a wide range of issues so he is already a more divisive figure and that won't simply be forgotten when he takes the throne.\n\nHe was ahead of his time on many issues, warning as far back as the 1970s of the dangers of climate change before it became a mainstream issue, and he continues to do so now when, for many, it's become a political issue.\n\nA giant portrait of Prince Charles outside a Young Entrepreneurs Event in Accra, Ghana, on November 5.\n\nAt a speech in Accra, Ghana, last week, the Prince said, \"I know, Mr. President, that you share my determination that the Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep-seated and deeply integrated. No issue is more pressing, it seems to me, than that of climate change. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provided stark and alarming evidence that even 1.5 degrees of warming will mean catastrophic damage to the planet's ecosystems, sent a clear signal that we must all surely heed.\"\n\nCharles will become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.\n\nHe made the case again in Nigeria with a group of powerful regional leaders. After the meeting in Abuja, the Emir of Kano was positive about the Prince's interventions, telling CNN: \"He's been talking about climate change. He's been talking about demographic implosions. He's been talking about town planning and we do not make the connection between these three issues, for example, and some of the conflicts we see.\"\n\nPrince Charles attends a meeting with regional leaders in Abuja on November 6.\n\nThere was particular interest in his work on youth unemployment, which is rife in the region, though the prince wasn't able to see as much of the country as he had hoped, to his frustration. Because of security concerns, the British government called off a visit to Jos, a city in Central Nigeria that has been the scene of deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.\n\n\"The only sad thing for me was not being able to go further into other parts of Nigeria,\" Prince Charles told CNN. \"It is such a vast country and obviously there are so many other states and interesting areas. I know many are facing different challenges and other opportunities, so it was a pity not being able to do that, but otherwise it's always marvellous coming here because people are so friendly. I'm always intrigued by the way so many of these young, for instance, are developing really interesting ideas that they can turn into businesses and things like that, helping to tackle some of the real issues we face, particularly around the environment and waste and goodness knows what else. Very ingenious characters.\"\n\nAt 70, Prince Charles has given his future role \"a lot of thought,\" the senior aide told CNN, particularly what he will and won't be able to speak about, but it \"doesn't weigh heavily\" on his shoulders.\n\nIf he feels any pressure, it appears to be completing his work as Prince of Wales, which is a role he has made his own. He's redefined the responsibility that comes with being heir and in that sense he has already left a legacy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Young Marxists are going missing in China after protesting for workers", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/JLJkCzt7Sps/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) Fear is sweeping through the campuses of China's elite universities following a nationwide government crackdown aimed at silencing left-wing student activists, who had been campaigning for greater rights and protections for ordinary workers.\n\nSince August at least nine young Chinese labor advocates have been forcibly detained in major cities across the country, a sharp escalation in Beijing's campaign against student activism on university campuses.\n\n\"The whole of Peking University is like under the white terror now, (the security guards) will come after you even if you were just at the scene where the student activists were distributing leaflets,\" a student at the prestigious Peking University told CNN Tuesday.\n\nOn Friday, one graduate, Zhang Shengye, was attacked and dragged into a car at the Beijing university by several people in black jackets, according to a widely circulated open letter.\n\n\"Someone used his arm to put me in a headlock and pushed me forward ...

Others claimed they were beaten by security personnel while protesting.\n\nOn July 29, a group of left-wing students, proclaiming themselves Maoists, traveled from around the country to join in the protests, drawing national attention.\n\nOne Peking University graduate, Yue Xin, published an open letter calling for students at universities across China to join in supporting the workers and sign a petition.\n\nBut as public attention grew, the government quickly tightened the net around the young protesters. On August 11, one of the main organizers, Shen Mengyu, a graduate of Sun Yat-sen University, another elite school in southern China, was detained by a group of unidentified men.\n\nYue disappeared on August 24, along with a number of her fellow students. No official arrest reports have been announced yet by police and neither Shen or Yue have been seen since.\n\nFollowing their disappearance, a group of alumni and students at Peking University set up the \"Finding Yue Movement\" to lobby for the graduates' release. One of the organizers, Zhang, was among those who disappeared in the past week.\n\n\"There is a pervasive sense of fear particularly after what happened in Peking University a few nights ago ... (Zhang's) crime was essentially to draw attention to the fact that another student had disappeared,\" Friedman, the American professor, told CNN.\n\n'Wave of repression'\n\nFriedman's university, Cornell, cut ties with China's Renmin University in October over growing questions around academic freedom in the country, as well as concerns for the safety of exchange students.\n\n\"The wave of repression we're in is not just the last few weeks. It's a very conscious strategy on the park of the state to close a space for academic freedom,\" he said.\n\nFriedman said Chinese students were being strongly pushed to study Marxism in universities, in juxtaposition to banned Western ideologies considered dangerous by the government, such as democracy or liberalism.\n\n\"Now they're taken it to heart, the government is cracking down quite significantly. In some ways, this is the government's own making,\" he said.\n\nThe arrests came shortly after the arrival of a new Communist Party chief at Peking University, Qiu Shuiping, who was formerly the top state security official in Beijing between 2013 and 2014.\n\nAnalysts at the time pointed to Qiu's appointment as an indication the Communist Party wanted to pull the student community at the university into line.\n\nDespite the disappearances and the attacks, not all the left-wing activists are giving up.

The truth is, he was the leader of nothing,\" Lichtman said.\n\nGuzman's escapes from Mexican prisons furthered the myth of him as a dangerous cartel boss, his lawyer said.\n\n\"A conviction of Guzman is the biggest prize the prosecution could have dreamed of,\" he told the jurors. \"They claim he is the biggest drug dealer in the world. It's false.\"\n\nBefore opening statements Tuesday, a juror -- in a letter to the judge that was read aloud in court -- asked to be dismissed from the case because she has suffered from anxiety since jury selection. The prosecution and defense agreed to excuse the juror.\n\nThe defense was unable to finish its statement and will pick it up Wednesday morning.\n\nUnprecedented security\n\nThe court proceedings -- the most significant criminal trial in decades -- come nearly two years after Guzman's extradition from Mexico.\n\nThe man once considered the world's biggest drug trafficker is accused of heading a criminal enterprise that spanned continents and triggered waves of bloodshed throughout his native Mexico.\n\nHis long-awaited trial, which could last four months, began under unprecedented security measures, including armed escorts for the anonymous and partly sequestered jurors\n\nHeavily armed federal marshals and officers with bomb-sniffing dogs stood guard outside the courthouse. Metal detectors greeted visitors at the entrance to the courtroom. The Brooklyn Bridge shut downs each time a police motorcade -- including an ambulance and a SWAT team -- shuttled Guzman to and from the Manhattan federal lockup.\n\n\"El Chapo, despite his defense that he was just a minor player, was reputed to be the innovative spirit behind the Sinaloa cartel,\" said Bruce Bagley, an expert on Mexico's drug cartels at the University of Miami. \"He is, in many ways, a survivor.\"\n\nHis capture fueled an alarming surge in violence\n\nGuzman, 61, has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of international drug trafficking, conspiring to murder rivals, gun charges and money laundering, he faces a sentence of life in prison.\n\nHe allegedly earned nearly $14 billion as kingpin of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which employed planes, boats and submarines to move hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico before shipping it to US distribution hubs.\n\nA near-mythical figure celebrated in Mexican ballads, Guzman oversaw the smuggling of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana to wholesale distributors in Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New York, Arizona and Los Angeles, federal prosecutors have alleged.\n\nHe is also accused of taking part in at least 30 killings as he reigned over one of Mexico's oldest and most influential cartels.\n\nThe defense placed blame for the continuing drug trade on Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, a man who they say benefited from Guzman's capture. Lichtman alleges the current and former presidents of Mexico \"received hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes from his organization.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto denied the accusation in a statement posted on Twitter. \"The government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto persecuted, captured, and extradited the criminal Joaquin Guzman Loera,\" the statement said. \"The accusations made by his lawyer are completely false and defamatory.\"\n\nFormer President Felipe Calder\u00f3n also denied the accusation via Twitter. \"The claims made by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's lawyer are absolutely false. Neither he nor the Sinaloa cartel nor anyone else made any payments to me.\"\n\nFels, the US attorney, said in court Tuesday that the government will prove Guzman is guilty through audio and video evidence, text messages and testimony from law enforcement officials and former associates of Guzman.\n\nFels said the government had access to his communications, despite his concerted efforts to keep communications private.\n\n\"For a short period of time, the government was listening, the government was recording,\" Fels said.\n\nCartel battles bloody Mexico\n\n\"No single individual has been more consequential than Guzman in the waves of violence that Mexico has experienced in the last decade,\" said David Shirk, director of the Justice in Mexico program at the University of San Diego.\n\nGuzman reportedly initiated deadly conflicts with other major cartels that led to massive spikes in violent crime from 2008 to 2012, according to Shirk.\n\nHis capture and extradition to the United States early last year created a power vacuum that fueled an alarming surge in the bloodletting.\n\n\"Of all of the symbols involved in the kingpin strategy (of targeting high-profile crime leaders in order to weaken their organization), El Chapo was by far the most important because he grew like a rocket, because he became so rich and so powerful,\" Bagley said.\n\n'An equal opportunity corrupter'\n\nOver two decades, Guzman transformed the Sinaloa cartel into one of the world's most significant organized crime groups, Bagley said. Its dominance of the international cocaine trade began with Guzman's implementation of a more horizontal leadership structure, his propensity for violence and largesse toward corrupt public officials.\n\n\"He spread money around in industrial quantities, as they say in Mexican Spanish,\" Bagley said. \"He was willing to pay million-dollar bribes or even more -- going from the municipality to the state up to the federal government. He was an equal-opportunity corrupter.\"\n\nThe case against Guzman will be built in part on the testimony of more than a dozen cooperating witnesses, including former cartel associates already incarcerated or who have been given new identities and relocated by the US government.\n\nTheir names have remained unknown to Guzman's defense lawyers until the eve of the trial, with prosecutors arguing that witnesses in previous cases have turned up dead.\n\nThe twins became informants for the feds and went into protective custody, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Flores brothers pleaded guilty to narcotics distribution conspiracy after recording phone conversations in which Guzman is heard agreeing to decrease the price of a load of heroin.\n\nTheir father was \"kidnapped and presumed killed as a result\" of their cooperation with federal authorities, a defense attorney said when the Flores brothers were sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2015.\n\nSinaloa cartel remains dominant player in cocaine trade\n\nGuzman is also known for his dramatic prison escapes. In 2001, while serving a 20-year sentence for criminal association and bribery in Mexico, he reportedly broke out by hiding in a laundry cart. He was recaptured in 2014 at a hotel in the Pacific beach town of Mazatlan. But the next year he escaped again through a hole in his cell that led to a mile-long underground tunnel.\n\nIn January 2016, authorities closed in on Guzman at a hideaway in the coastal city of Los Mochis. The next year -- one day before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump -- he was extradited aboard a flight from Juarez, Mexico, to New York.\n\nHe has been held in solitary confinement in a small cell at the federal lockup in Manhattan.\n\nNearly two years after his extradition, the Sinaloa cartel remains the dominant player in the cocaine trade, according to Bagley.\n\n\"Despite El Chapo's apparent demise and his extradition to the United States -- and I do consider it a final demise -- and the inability of his children to take over the organization, Sinaloa has kept a degree of coherence because of its business model,\" he said.\n\nSaid Shirk: \"As important as he was to Mexico's drug trade, ultimately Guzman will be supplanted by other traffickers as long as the drug war wages on.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Pence tells Aung San Suu Kyi the persecution of Rohingya is 'without excuse'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/2H3MVMSMPlE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) US Vice President Mike Pence told Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi Wednesday that the treatment of her country's stateless Rohingya Muslim population was inexcusable.\n\n\"The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes which resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh is without excuse,\" Pence told Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Singapore. \"I'm anxious to hear about the progress you're making in holding those accountable who are responsible.\"\n\nIt comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp.

It burned through 20,000 acres in less than 14 hours on Thursday. By Monday, it had reached 113,000 acres.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties doubled in size in a 90-minute period Friday morning, to 8,000 acres. By Monday morning, it was up to more than 91,500 acres. The Hill Fire in Ventura County has torched 4,531 acres.\n\nHere's why the fires are moving so quickly:\n\nPowerful winds\n\nIn Southern California, the Santa Ana winds pushing the fires are expected to remain strong in Ventura and Los Angeles counties through Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said Monday.\n\nIn fact, the strongest winds for Southern California may come Tuesday and could reach near-hurricane gale force, he said.\n\nThese winds, which began in the middle of last week, may last through the end of this week.\n\nIn Northern California, the offshore winds that had been whipping the area for days are expected to die down Monday, Hennen said. The classic offshore flow was similar to the Santa Ana winds.\n\nLack of rain, dry conditions\n\nThough the drought in California has eased somewhat, all of the state is still abnormally dry, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes a lot of dry vegetation for the fires to burn.\n\nMore than half the state is in a moderate drought or worse and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nTim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, said the Camp Fire is \"unique to be this late in northern California.\"\n\nNormally, a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, he said Friday at a news conference. But it hasn't rained much this fall, he said, creating \"mid-summer-like conditions.\"\n\n\"It kind of lined up perfectly to have the large 90,000-plus acre fire run we had (Thursday),\" Chavez said. \"Fuels will continue to get drier and drier and drier until we do finally get a season-ending rainfall event.\"\n\nThe terrain makes it hard for firefighters\n\nThe hills and canyons of Southern California are beautiful, but they can make it difficult for firefighters to gain access to wildfires.\n\nThe fire that broke out Friday near the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens occurred on a steep hillside that could not be accessed by firetrucks, so firefighters had to approach the fire on foot, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\n\nThe canyons can accelerate fires.

The organization has been keeping statistics for 100 years.

It is five, not including the Camp Fire."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Even in the Senate, 2018 looks like other wave years for Democrats", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ImsCPvcTCF8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "That's wrong.\n\nGiven the challenging map, Democrats did about as well as you would expect them to do in the in a wave election.\n\nDemocrats look on pace to win about 69% of all Senate races that were up for election this year.\n\nI went back and looked at the overall Senate outcome in midterms since senators began to be popularly elected a little more than 100 years ago. Democrats performance this year ties them for the fifth highest percentage out of the 27 since 1914. It puts 2018 slightly ahead of 1974 (68%).\n\nNow, Republicans can certainly crow about Democrats losing Senate seats even with an unpopular president. On average, the opposition party gains four seats in a midterm. There were certainly points this cycle it looked possible (though difficult) for Democrats to net gain seats.\n\nBut Democrats had a lot of exposure. They were defending 26 seats, 10 of which were in unfriendly territory President Donald Trump won in 2016. That reality upends expectations about net loss and net gain. There is, in other words, a bit of a reversion to the mean when one party controls a lot of seats.\n\nIf you were to look at the previous 26 midterms and were trying to predict how many seats the Democrats would win based on how many seats they controlled beforehand and the party of the president, you would have estimated that they net lose four seats. They only ended up net losing two seats. In other words, they did two seats better than should have been expected.\n\nBut let's get a little more nitty gritty and get down to the individual seat level. Democrats did pretty well given how many seats were up in red states.\n\nIf you were to look back at all Senate elections since 1982 and tried to estimate how well a party would do given the past presidential vote in each state, Democrats did on average about seven points better than expected. This seven-point overperformance, perhaps unsurprisingly, will match or come close to matching what looks to be the Democrats popular vote margin in the House. It also ranks as the Democrats third best over-performance in the last 19 Senate elections.\n\nOf course, Democrats holding so many seats at the beginning of the cycle was to their advantage in a way. Incumbents tend to do better than candidates running in open seats or those taking on so-said incumbents. It's a little difficult to control for the incumbency factor because it has significantly lessened over the last 15 years ago.\n\nStill, it's pretty safe to look at midterm elections occurring over the last 10 years. Specifically, let's examine the last three midterms : 2010, 2014 and 2018.\n\nRepublicans net picked up six seats in 2010 and nine seats in 2014. No doubt that's better than Democrats did this year in the net seat loss/won category.\n\nDemocrats though ended up actually controlling a slightly higher percentage (69%) of the seats up for election in 2018 than Republicans did in 2010 (65%) or 2014 (67%).\n\nLooking at the individual seat level and controlling for incumbency and the past presidential vote, Democrats had on-par or slightly better performances than Republicans did in 2010 and 2014. The average Democrat did about 5 points better than expected in 2018. The average Republican did five points better in 2010 and three points better in 2014.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense when you look at the national environment. Republicans won the House popular vote in 2010 by about the same as Democrats did in 2018. They did slightly worse in 2014 than this year.\n\nNow, I wouldn't call the 2018 Senate result a \"wave.\" I don't think you can given the fact that Democrats lost seats. Once you control for key factors though, the result was about you'd expect in a wave year."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "McSally emerges as potential replacement for Kyl in Senate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/bceYG7Df67c/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) For Rep. Martha McSally, there may be another way to get to the Senate : an appointment.\n\nA day after the Arizona Republican conceded her Senate campaign to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the state's other senator, Jon Kyl, told CNN on Tuesday he has decided whether to leave office before his term ends at the end of next year. He wouldn't reveal his decision, but said he will talk to Gov. Doug Ducey about it.\n\nHe also praised McSally, who once worked on his staff as a national security adviser, when asked about her as a potential replacement if he resigns.\n\n\"Martha McSally would be a very good member of the United States Senate, however she got there,\" Kyl said. \"And I regret that she didn't make it in her election.\"\n\n\"I can't think of anybody more qualified than Martha McSally,\" he added.\n\nIn the interview, Kyl made clear that an appointment would be Ducey's decision, saying he didn't \"want to try to try to influence that.\" He said his comments \"have nothing to do with any potential candidate to replace me.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, in a separate interview, Kyl continued to praise McSally, but said his praise was meant outside the context of an appointment \"because it is strictly the governor's job and he's got a lot of factors to consider and I'm not getting in the way of that.\"\n\nIn September, Ducey tapped Kyl to temporarily replace former Sen. John McCain, who died in late August . At the time, Kyl said he would remain in office at least through this year -- but that he would not run for re-election in 2020, when a special election will be held to fill the remaining two years of McCain's term. It left open the possibility that Ducey would be choosing a second replacement after the midterm elections.\n\nKyl said Tuesday that he and his family have \"pretty much come to the conclusion of what we want to do,\" but would not reveal that decision.\n\nWhen asked if he would continue to serve in the Senate in 2019, Kyl said, \"I'm going to be discussing my plans with the governor, and everybody else will be the second to know.\"\n\nAides and operatives close to Ducey deflected questions about a potential replacement for Kyl early this week.\n\n\"The governor is hopeful that Kyl will continue to serve in the appointed Senate seat through 2020,\" said Ducey senior adviser Daniel Ruiz. \"At this point we would not speculate on a vacancy that does not exist.\"\n\nKyl said he talks to Ducey \"all the time\" and not to expect an announcement \"anytime soon\" about his future.\n\nBut in the wake of Sinema's victory in the race for Arizona's other Senate seat, some Republicans in the state buzzed about the possibility of McSally replacing Kyl.\n\n\"I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to think that he would do. The governor's kept his cards very close to his chest,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a veteran Arizona Republican strategist.\n\nThere are, several Arizona Republicans pointed out, significant downsides to appointing McSally, too: She's the only Republican to lose a Senate race in Arizona in 30 years. And she cast aside what had been a more moderate record on issues like immigration to align herself closely with Trump -- a departure from the tactics of Ducey, who ran as an independent-minded, business-focused governor in a runaway re-election victory.\n\n\"Hopefully she'll have learned something from this election, in terms of making herself more friendly to the Arizona electorate,\" Coughlin said of McSally.\n\nMcSally and Ducey aren't particularly close, Arizona Republicans said -- and McSally is just one of several possible selections. Others on the list include Karrin Taylor Robson, an Arizona Board of Regents member and real estate developer, who is well-liked by the GOP donor community; Kirk Adams, a former Arizona House speaker who is Ducey's chief of staff but widely expected to leave his office soon; and Eileen Klein, a chief of staff for former Gov. Jan Brewer who Ducey appointed state treasurer in April.\n\nDucey's appointment wouldn't preclude other Arizona Republicans from running in the 2020 primary in a race that's likely to be among the nation's most competitive.\n\nFormer Arizona attorney general Grant Woods, a former chief of staff for McCain, has said he is considering running for Senate as a Democrat. Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, has also openly mulled a run. Rep. Ruben Gallego and Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor who was elected to the House last week, are also on the list of potential candidates Democratic strategists have mentioned."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Election Night in America Continued", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/u_A9dt6eYXc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Newly elected Democrat Lauren Underwood, who will represent an Illinois district in Congress, said she pushed through the fear of being a candidate for the first time because she \"knew the seeds were planted.\"\n\nUnderwood said it was clear to her that her district, Illinois 14th, had the \u201craw material to be successful,\u201d pointing to the close margin by which Trump won her district. \u201cWe knew that the seeds were planted we just had to cultivate them so that they would grow and sprout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that in this election a woman could be very successful in engaging other women throughout our community,\u201d Underwood told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\n\nShe said women in the community have been activists and leaders, and there would be a \u201cnatural base of support there.\u201d\n\nUnderwood said she also \u201cknew that the electorate, the voters, were interested in a new generation of leadership, were interested in supporting someone that came from their own ranks, came from their community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to show up in the communities -- this era of like, no town halls is unacceptable,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cWe have to continue to engage our voters, engage the community, make sure that their voice is being heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way that we can make sure that that happens,\u201d Underwood said, \u201cis to continue to be there and have an everlasting presence in our district.\u201d"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Who is Mira Ricardel and why did Melania Trump want her fired?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/TD5bD-NV9S8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Mira Ricardel barely lasted seven months as deputy national security adviser before First Lady Melania Trump issued an unprecedented call for her dismissal and President Donald Trump moved to fire her.\n\nIn those few months on the job, Ricardel generated a long list of enemies and developed a reputation for shouting at subordinates, plotting against White House officials she disliked and leaking stories about her administration opponents to the press. One source familiar with the situation said Ricardel's firing is due in part to her \"bullying\" of aides both above and below her.\n\nCurrent and former colleagues of Ricardel paint a picture of a committed conservative and national security expert with a strong personality. One former colleague described her as someone who doesn't \"suffer fools\" or have a nuanced touch when it comes to navigating the shoals of internal politics. A White House official was blunter, describing the California native as ideologically driven and \"obstinate\".\n\nEnemies\n\nThe former State Department and Pentagon official made enemies of heavyweights within the Trump administration, feuding with chief of staff John Kelly, his deputy Zach Fuentes, and locked horns with Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to people familiar with the White House intrigue.\n\nBut her spat with the first lady's staff over Mrs. Trump's trip to Africa -- apparently over seating on the plane and the use of National Security Council resources -- seems to have earned her the enmity of the person who may wield the most weight with Trump: his wife.\n\nThe President told people on Tuesday that he had made the decision to fire Ricardel, but that he was giving her time to clear her desk, making her the latest in a long list of high ranking officials who have left or been booted from the Trump administration.\n\nRicardel did not return requests for comment.\n\nRicardel was raised in Pasadena, the child of a Croatian immigrant and went on to study at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and then do doctoral work at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\nLong experience\n\nShe went on to hold positions in three Republican administrations, working in the departments of State, Defense and Commerce, as well as acting as an aide to then Republican Senate leader Bob Dole. She has also worked in the private sector, including at Boeing, before becoming a member of Trump's presidential transition team as a Pentagon adviser.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, who was in Singapore when news of Ricardel's dismissal broke, said when he tapped her to be his deputy in April that she \"has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues.\"\n\nAnd yet repeatedly during Ricardel's tenure, news stories trickled out of the troubled White House that suggested she wasn't managing teams or working within them particularly well.\n\nMost famously, she clashed with Mattis during the transition. Ricardel blocked some of his picks for Pentagon positions because they included former Obama administration officials who she felt were not strict Republican loyalists, multiple defense officials have told CNN.\n\nMattis then blocked Ricardel from getting a high level job at the Pentagon. In the months since Ricardel's arrival at the NSC, White House sources have repeatedly leaking stories to the press saying that Ricardel and Bolton were spreading rumors about Mattis' imminent departure in an effort to pressure the Pentagon chief to leave.\n\nBolton and Ricardel allegedly believe that Mattis is not \"ideologically aligned\" with Trump, according to Foreign Policy magazine, which quoted a former official saying that the two were trying \"to build the sense that he is done for.\"\n\nA former Trump transition official who is close to Ricardel said Ricardel thinks Mattis \"never should have been appointed and thinks he's a Democrat and tells anyone who will listen.\"\n\nRicardel also had a fraught relationship with Kelly and Fuentes, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believed Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, those sources said.\n\nBut Ricardel seems to have crossed a line in taking on Melania Trump's office over the first lady's trip to Africa in October, making what some viewed as challenging requests and being obstinate, the White House official told CNN.\n\nSince then, the source continued, some officials said she has been dishonest about what went on and leaked stories to try and cover her behavior.\n\nThe former Trump transition official said they were not surprised to hear that Ricardel butted heads with the first lady and her staff, saying, \"she does not suffer fools.\" The former transition official characterized Ricardel as \"smart and tough,\" but acknowledged that she is not always effective at navigating \"internal politics.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "National security aide headed for exit after clash with Melania Trump's office", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/xpevTb-XzkE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A feud with the first lady's office is expected to cost a senior national security adviser her job after she sparred with East Wing staff and other key members of the Trump administration.\n\nThe dispute spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion on Tuesday when the first lady's office released a statement calling for deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel's ouster as reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would fire the official.\n\nA White House official confirmed to CNN that Trump has told people that Ricardel will be fired. But the official said she has been given some time to clear out her desk. It was not immediately clear when she would officially make her exit.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement amounted to a stunning public rebuke by a first lady of a senior official serving in her husband's administration. It came after reports surfaced earlier Tuesday indicating Ricardel would be pushed out of her post after less than seven months on the job.\n\nNeither Ricardel nor spokespeople for the National Security Council responded to CNN requests for comment.\n\nReflecting the fast-moving nature of the events, soon after a Wall Street Journal report surfaced Tuesday afternoon alleging Ricardel was fired and escorted off the White House grounds, a senior White House official denied the story to reporters.\n\nThe official said Ricardel was still in her office Tuesday afternoon. The official declined to speculate further about Ricardel's future in the administration.\n\nHer departure would leave national security adviser John Bolton without one of his key allies in the administration, a deputy who has also shared his penchant for bureaucratic infighting.\n\nIt was those sharp elbows that sources said led to the first lady's stinging statement, with Ricardel most recently feuding with members of the first lady's staff over her trip to Africa. One person familiar with the matter said Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.\n\nA White House official accused Ricardel of being dishonest about the feud and subsequently leaking stories to try to cover her behavior.\n\nAnd before her spat with the East Wing, Ricardel butted heads repeatedly with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a rivalry that was well-known within the Trump administration. Her disputes with Mattis preceded her time as deputy national security adviser, going back to the presidential transition when Ricardel sought to block Mattis from hiring certain people who had been critical of Trump or were viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump.\n\nTensions have also been rising between Ricardel and chief of staff John Kelly and his deputy Zach Fuentes in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believe Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, the people said.\n\nThe dispute made it difficult for Ricardel to land in a top post in the Trump administration, though she was ultimately tapped for the position of undersecretary of commerce for export administration. Ricardel then joined the National Security Council as Bolton's deputy in April after he was named national security adviser.\n\nRicardel has been key to Bolton's efforts to restructure the National Security Council and to help Bolton secure his place as an influential adviser to the President on all foreign policy matters.\n\nThe drama surrounding Ricardel's possible ouster surfaced while Bolton was half a world away in Singapore, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.\n\nWest Wing caught off guard\n\nWest Wing officials were caught off guard on Tuesday by the statement from the first lady's spokeswoman targeting Ricardel, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nWhite House officials were generally aware of the tensions between Ricardel and the first lady's office stemming from the Africa trip, but were stunned to see the first lady take such a public stance against a senior staffer through her spokeswoman. Sources said officials in the White House press shop were particularly annoyed that they didn't get a heads-up from the East Wing.\n\nWest Wing and NSC officials are more upset at the way the East Wing handled the matter than the substance of the effort to push Ricardel out.\n\nOne person said neither Trump, Kelly nor press secretary Sarah Sanders knew the statement was coming.\n\nRicardel has made few friends since she came on board in April, clashing with officials across the administration. Two administration sources said she is generally not well liked, though others pushed back, saying she was a respected member of the team and one of the highest ranking women in the West Wing.\n\nEven one NSC official who said they liked Ricardel said she \"liked to pick fights with a lot of different folks\" and suspected her latest feud with the first lady's office was \"the last straw.\"\n\nAnother official was more forgiving: \"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone.\"\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Parents accuse CDC of not reporting children's deaths from polio-like AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/o2QBtMJhUpM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Moseley, Virginia (CNN) Parents of children who had a horrifying polio-like illness are accusing the Centers for Disease Control of hiding the deaths of two children who suffered from the condition.\n\nThe parents say by not publicly acknowledging the two deaths, the agency is intentionally downplaying the severity of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a disease that paralyzes healthy children in a matter of hours.\n\n\"I feel like they're just sugar-coating this,\" said Katie Bustamante, whose son Alex, age 6, died in May. \"It eliminates my trust in the CDC.\"\n\nTheir accusations come amid a wave of criticism from parents of children with AFM and from some of the CDC's own medical advisers. In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "As more cases confirmed, CDC says evidence suggests 'viral association' for AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/E9Lz63t48Sg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, a polio-like illness that mostly affects children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.\n\nThere are also 162 possible cases under investigation, 23 more than last week.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nThe agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.\n\nThe CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report, \"Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that the agency is \"not ruling anything out.\"\n\nIn the past two weeks, the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM.\n\nEnteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.\n\nTypically, enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy.\n\nSome of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus, but others have not, although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus.\n\nIt's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family, several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms, but only one may become paralyzed.\n\nTwo weeks ago , four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide, looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes.\n\nThe experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes, which they said were highly unlikely, and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.\n\n\"I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this,\" Dr. Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said of the CDC's new report. \"It's great.\"\n\nVan Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it.\n\nDr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM, agreed. \"I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBoth neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks.\n\nJeremy Wilcox, a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September, also praised the agency for becoming more open.\n\nParents of children with AFM say that for years, their emails to the CDC went unanswered. Last week, Wilcox arranged a meeting between Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency's principal deputy director, and more than a dozen parents of children with AFM.

All sectors of the food and drinks industry were challenged to cut sugar content by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n\"Despite milkshakes being incorporated into Public Health England's sugar reduction program as part of the government's childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a 20% reduction, said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar. \"These very high-calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay -- that is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe group is urging health authorities to go further by calling for mandatory traffic light colored nutrition labeling across all menus. In addition, the group has called for an outright ban on the sale of milkshakes containing more than 300 calories per serving.\n\nAccording to the charity's research, nine out of 10 milkshakes sold in UK supermarkets would be eligible for a red label for the excessive level of sugar they contain. Nevertheless, these products contained far less sugar than the freakshakes sold in fast-food outlets.\n\n\"Milkshakes can contain significant amounts of sugar,\" said Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE in response to the report. \"The food and drink industry -- including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers -- has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nA spokesman for Toby Carvery said: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children.\"\n\nThe chain is \"very mindful of our role in helping guests make informed decisions\" and makes public the nutrition information for its menu, the spokesperson said. The company has also committed to PHE's sugar reduction program.\n\nSpokespersons for Five Guys weren't immediately available for comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "US has highest rate of drug overdoses, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/heqqq5WGIE0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The United States has more than double the rate of premature overdose deaths of at least 12 other countries, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, says that there were an estimated 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 in the US.\n\n\"The U.S. has the highest death rate due to drug overdoses for both men and women (35 deaths in 100,000 men and 20 deaths in 100,000 women) in 2015, more than double those of any other country in our study,\" Yingxi Chen, one of the researchers and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute , wrote in an email.\n\nMexico had the lowest rates: 1 death per 100,000 men and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 women.\n\nThe researchers also found that the United States had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths: 4.3% per year in men and 5.3% per year in women, Chen said.

EU-UK technical talks are, in fact, ongoing as neither all the \"i\"s, nor all the \"t\"s of a deal have yet been dotted or crossed.\n\nThe thinking here is: if the UK cabinet or certain EU member states strongly object to specific parts of the draft document (as long as they don't rip up the whole thing), then negotiators can go back to the drawing board."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Prince Charles reveals love of 'groussaka' as he turns 70", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46202198", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Chris Jackson/Clarence House\n\nPrince Charles has revealed his love of \"groussaka\" - his version of the Greek dish moussaka, but with grouse instead of lamb - on the day he turns 70.\n\nThe Prince of Wales made the comments in the latest edition of Country Life, which he edited to mark his birthday.\n\nHe also told the magazine about his fondness for red squirrels and how he lets them run around his home.\n\nTwo new photos of the prince with his family have been released by Clarence House to celebrate the landmark.\n\nOther events include a private party at Buckingham Palace hosted by the Queen, who will give a speech for her son.\n\nPrince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will also attend a tea party at Spencer House in London to celebrate 70 inspirational people marking their 70th birthdays this year.\n\nThere will be traditional gun salutes at Green Park at midday and the Tower of London at 13:00 GMT, when the bells will also be rung at Westminster Abbey.\n\nWriting in Country Life, the prince talks about his love of food and the magazine features one of his favourite recipes - pheasant crumble pie.\n\nHe says: \"I got this recipe from someone I know.

What does she mean?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019. The reason the UK is leaving is because people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice and what post-Brexit relations will look like. A deal has to agreed by negotiators but also by Theresa May's cabinet, then MPs and, finally, by the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWill there really be a deal this week?\n\nA cabinet source has told BBC the text of the withdrawal agreement has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive talks this week. Theresa May is holding a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the agreement.\n\nWhy is the PM so keen to get a deal by Wednesday?\n\nAny hopes of an EU summit to sign off on a withdrawal agreement this month will apparently be hit if the talks go on much longer - there will not be enough time to set up a meeting of the 28 leaders.\n\nThe next possible date for a meeting of EU leaders is in December, which could result in the Commons vote on any deal being delayed until after Christmas.\n\nWith uncertainty over whether MPs would back a deal, missing this week's deadline would increase the chances of the UK leaving without one. The UK government would then step up no-deal preparations and spending.\n\nWhat were they still arguing about in Brussels?\n\nThe sticking point over the Irish border. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with border posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nBut the two sides have not been able to agree how they can guarantee this - with the EU insisting on a \"backstop\" arrangement which will kick in to avoid a physical border if whatever future trade deal the UK and EU agree does not manage to maintain the current border arrangements.\n\nWhat about a trade deal?\n\nThe two sides are hoping to agree a rough outline of a trade deal to be signed off at the same time as the withdrawal agreement. If all goes as planned, the details will be hammered out after the UK leaves.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nEven if she does get her top team to sign off on a Brexit withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.\n\nShe does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them.\n\nIf the only choice presented to MPs is her plan or a no-deal scenario it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote.\n\nIf she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: DUP 'could not back draft Brexit deal'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-46202568", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is the chief whip of the Democratic Unionist Party and MP for Lagan Valley\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said a draft Brexit deal between the UK and Brussels \"fundamentally undermines the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK\".\n\nHe said his party wants to see Brexit, but \"this is not the right Brexit\".\n\nHis comments come as talks enter crunch time, with the Irish border the sticking point.\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar is to hold a special cabinet meeting later.\n\nThe meeting to discuss the draft text will take place in Dublin.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement, which has been drawn up alongside a statement of future relations with the EU, has not been published but is thought to run to some 500 pages.\n\nIt addresses the Northern Ireland \"backstop\", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations.\n\nThe backstop within the agreed draft is believed to avoid a return to a \"hard border\" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union?\n\nThe UK government faces a battle to win Parliament's backing for the draft text and relies on the DUP's support to win key Commons votes.\n\nSir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that the \"Northern Ireland backstop has been rolled into a UK-wide backstop\" and this could have consequences for the union.\n\n\"I think it has been described by one commentator as like a swimming pool, and Northern Ireland will be in at the deep end,\" he added.\n\n'Break-up of the UK'\n\n\"If the United Kingdom wants to leave, we will have much closer regulation in terms of both the customs arrangements and the single market, so we will be treated very differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Many people conclude that this will lead to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.

\"freakshakes\" hold such appeal\n\nThe campaign group Action on Sugar is demanding a ban on freakshakes and all milkshakes with more than 300 calories.\n\nIt surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained \"grotesque levels of sugar and calories\".\n\nFreakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories.\n\nThat is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds.\n\nIn terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation calculates an average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories.\n\nThe researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult.\n\nThey say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving.\n\nAction on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus.\n\nThe government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) also has a sugar reduction programme as part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that.\n\nAction on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough.\n\n\"These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving.\"\n\nRegistered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was \"shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it\".\n\nShe said it was \"time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products\".\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFreakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon.\n\nToby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester.\n\nBoth companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes.\n\nA Toby Carvery spokesperson added: \"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes.\"\n\nAnd a Harvester spokesperson said: \"We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests.\"\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAction on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars.\n\nThe top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour.\n\nA spokesperson for Muller said: \"We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste. That's why we introduced a Frijj zero added sugar range.\n\n\"Milk contains naturally occurring sugars in the form of lactose but we would stress that it is also a natural and nutrient rich product, containing essential nutrients such as protein, calcium and vitamins.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Fat-clogged cells explain why obesity can cause cancer", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46179118", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:49", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nA new discovery could explain why obese people are more likely to develop cancer, scientists say.\n\nA type of cell the body uses to destroy cancerous tissue gets clogged by fat and stops working, the team, from Trinity College Dublin, found.\n\nObesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK after smoking, Cancer Research UK says.\n\nAnd more than one in 20 cancer cases - about 22,800 cases each year in the UK - are caused by excess body weight.\n\nExperts already suspected fat sent signals to the body that could both damage cells, leading to cancer, and increase the number of them.\n\nNow, the Trinity scientists have been able to show, in Nature Immunology journal, how the body's cancer-fighting cells get clogged by fat.\n\nAnd they hope to be able to find drug treatments that could restore these \"natural killer\" cells' fighting abilities.\n\n'Lose some weight'\n\nProf Lydia Lynch said: \"A compound that can block the fat uptake by natural killer cells might help.\n\n\"We tried it in the lab and found it allowed them to kill again.\n\n\"But arguably a better way would be to lose some weight - because that is healthier for you anyway.\"\n\nDr Leo Carlin, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said: \"Although we know that obesity increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer, we still don't fully understand the mechanisms underlying the link.\n\n\"This study reveals how fat molecules prevent immune cells from properly positioning their tumour-killing machinery, and provides new avenues to investigate treatments.\n\n\"A lot of research focuses on how tumours grow in order to find metabolic targets to stop them, so this is a reminder that we should consider the metabolism of immune cells too.\"\n\nAvoiding cancer\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five lifestyle changes that could help people avoid cancer\n\nTo reduce risk:"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Briton dies from rabies after cat bite in Morocco", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46180330", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:50", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A cat in Morocco (file picture)\n\nA Briton has died after contracting rabies while on holiday in Morocco, health officials have said.\n\nPublic Health England said the victim became infected after being bitten by a cat.\n\nPHE issued a reminder to travellers to avoid coming into contact with animals when in rabies-affected countries.\n\nRabies is not found in wild or domestic animals in the UK, but five Britons became infected between 2000 and 2017 after \"animal exposures abroad\".\n\nSome species of bats in the UK can carry a rabies-like virus.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the disease occurs in more than 150 countries and causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.\n\nIt says in up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans.\n\nThe UK government says north African countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are among 139 nations where there is a high risk.\n\n'Important reminder'\n\nPHE did not release further details about the Briton's death.\n\nIt said that while there was no risk to the wider public, as a precautionary measure, health workers and close contacts of the person who died were being assessed and offered vaccination if necessary.\n\nRabies is a viral infection that affects the brain and central nervous system.

According to Prof Godfray he was \"explicitly asked\" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls.\n\nInstead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007.\n\nNatural boundaries\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nThese showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement.\n\nIt did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed.\n\nSince culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult.\n\nThey say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates.\n\nBut Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile.\n\n\"We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',\" he said.\n\n\"If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved.\"\n\nAnother argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle.\n\n\"It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe report warns however that continued culling \"would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial\" and says that a shift away from culling is \"highly desirable\".\n\nSpecifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination.\n\nTesting regime\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nProf Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed. It therefore urges that Defra adopts more sensitive tests.\n\nThe farming minister welcomed the report and said that Defra would give its response by next summer.\n\n''We welcome this review of the government's 25-year Bovine TB strategy and I extend my thanks to Sir Charles Godfray and his team for their hard work in producing the report.\n\n\"Sir Charles' report is an important contribution that will inform next steps in the strategy to achieve officially TB free status for England by 2038.''\n\nProf Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said that the report had many good ideas but said nothing about the effectiveness of the current badger culls.\n\n\"The report contains little critical evaluation of whether the current farmer-led culls are effectively reducing cattle TB,\" she said.\n\n\"It reports results from the first two years of monitoring without mentioning any of the caveats included by the original authors. It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third.\"\n\nProf Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out.\n\n\"Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mystery monkey: history of unique Xenothrix fossil revealed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46187670", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The monkey, called the xenothrix, was closely related to the titi monkey which lives in the Amazon\n\nA mysterious extinct monkey from Jamaica that is unlike any other in the fossil record has South American roots, according to new evidence.\n\nDNA extracted from fossilised bones suggests the monkey first colonised the island 11 million years ago.\n\nIt had no predators there and it evolved strange features not seen in living monkeys today.\n\nBut the animal went extinct a few hundred years ago, likely due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\nScientists say the discovery highlights how vulnerable unique island animals are to extinction.\n\n\"It was a really weird animal indeed,\" Prof Samuel Turvey from international conservation charity, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News.\n\n\"Possibly with legs like a rodent; body maybe like a slow loris.

The problem is what happens to them next.\n\nWet wipes are behind up to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water companies.\n\nThey say it costs \u00a3100m a year to deal with them.\n\nSkips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill.\n\nFrom their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year.\n\nImage caption Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester\n\nTony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: \"It's extremely frustrating. The amount of money that gets spent on dealing with blockages and disposing of this material could be reinvested in our ageing infrastructure.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we're not spending all this money, we could actually work to reduce customer bills.\"\n\nSome in the water industry are losing patience.\n\nMatt Wheeldon, a director at Wessex Water, has been pushing for action to prevent wipes being labelled as flushable.\n\nHe said: \"I think they're a complete scourge on our society.\n\n\"Whoever came up with the bad idea didn't think about the impact they're going to have on the environment.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"technically illegal to put anything down the toilet that's going to block up the sewer\".\n\n\"Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,\" agrees Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organisation City to Sea.\n\nShe points out that most manufacturers specify that so-called flushable wipes should only be flushed \"one at a time\".\n\n\"Manufacturers clearly know this is a problem. We need to start seeing them change what they say [on the packaging]. It can be confusing for consumers,\" she told BBC News.\n\nDeadly consequences\n\nMeanwhile, wipes which escape the filters have an even greater environmental impact, ending up in rivers and on beaches.\n\nThe wipes contain tiny plastic fibres which go on to harm fish and other marine life as the fibres are released and ingested, sometimes with deadly consequences.\n\nIn addition, the plastic fibres might then go on to be consumed by other animals potentially entering the human food chain.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wet wipes clogging up London sewers\n\nThames21 is an environmental charity which organises clear-ups of wet wipes from the banks of the Thames.\n\nIn the first six months of 2018, volunteers picked up around 120,000 wet wipes from one stretch of the riverbank near Hammersmith Bridge.\n\nAJ McConville, from the charity, said: \"The wet wipes are changing the shape of the foreshore.\n\n\"What seems to be happening is that wet wipes are getting snagged on something, and then they will slow down the water around them by creating turbulence, and by doing that they therefore attract even more wet wipes and more sediment to accumulate around them.\"\n\nImage caption Wet wipes on the riverbed of the Thames at low tide\n\nManufacturers have made efforts to improve the packaging of non-flushable wipes, making the \"do not flush\" logo larger and more prominent.\n\nBut it is the wipes marked \"flushable\" where there is disagreement.\n\nScientists at WRC, a water-testing laboratory in Swindon, carry out tests on wet wipes to assess their ability to disintegrate when they are flushed into the sewers.\n\nThey put wipes into conical flasks full of water and rotate them on a shaking platform - which they believe mimics the turbulence of water conditions in a sewer.\n\nUsing this technique, they have found that none of the wipes marked \"flushable\" which are currently available for sale in the UK pass the test.\n\nThere is hope on the horizon though. They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market.\n\nThe manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly.\n\nSome water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers.\n\nImage caption There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable'\n\nBut the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked \"flushable\" weren't the problem.\n\nLast year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard.\n\nBut these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.\n\nHear more on Costing The Earth on BBC Radio 4 on 13 November at 15:30 BST, repeated on 14 November at 21:00."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "New \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Trailer Reveals Final Season Will Be Cobbled Together From Old Footage", "article_link": "https://entertainment.theonion.com/new-game-of-thrones-trailer-reveals-final-season-will-1830420524", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES\u2014Shedding considerable light on the acclaimed fantasy epic\u2019s long-awaited conclusion, HBO released a new Game Of Thrones trailer Tuesday revealing that the show\u2019s final season will be cobbled together from old footage. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to confirm that the final season will focus on previously aired scenes that have been hastily edited together at the last second,\u201d said series co-creator David Benioff, adding that, if fans watch closely, they may be able to catch glimpses of several beloved, long-dead characters as well as some references to plot points from earlier seasons hidden throughout the teaser. \u201cWe know what our fans want, so we\u2019re hoping that the season eight delivers on that in a satisfying way.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Stung by Election Losses, House GOP Weighs Leadership Choice", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/stung-by-election-losses-house-gop-weighs-leadership-choice/4657815.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Frustration, finger-pointing and questions spilled over a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday night as lawmakers sorted through an election defeat that cost them the majority and began considering new leadership for their shrunken minority.\n\nRepublicans complained about the unpopularity of the GOP tax law they blamed for losses in New York and other key states, some attendees told reporters after the meeting.

Many point to Trump's willingness to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's denial of meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections during their July summit in Helsinki, contrary to the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nPost-election spin\n\nRussian social media efforts had already jumped on the ballot problems in Florida and Georgia before President Trump tweeted Friday.\n\nHamilton 68, an online dashboard run by the German Marshall Fund research group that monitors 600 Twitter accounts with ties to Moscow, found that as of early Friday afternoon, Russian media accounts had mentioned \"Florida\" 679 times in the previous 48 hours, making it the most mentioned topic.\n\nThe Russian-linked trolls and bots were also busy tweeting or retweeting hashtags \"stopthesteal,\" \"broward\" and \"florida.\"\n\nIn comparison, less than three hours after posting it, Trump's first tweet had been retweeted almost 23,000 times and liked by almost 76,000 accounts.\n\nBut even before that, Pfeiffer described Trump's behavior as \"shameful.\"\n\n\"I've been in government long enough to know that the elements of government can do everything they can to respond to a threat or to take any kind of action, but without solid direction coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, it's just never going to be as strong,\" he said.\n\nOther former officials have been more damning.\n\n\"Trump is the gift that keeps on giving for Putin,\"said retired Air Force Lt. Col. Hal Bidlack, echoing a phrase used by other former intelligence and defense officials in conversations with VOA.\n\nBidlack, who served on the National Security Council in the late 1990s, added, \"They [the Russians] understand they can play to his [Trump's] flattery and play to his insecurities.\"\n\nBlame the media\n\nWhite House officials charge the critics and the media with doing the greatest damage.\n\n\"It is correct to note that Russia pursues a goal of a divided and fractious America,\" a senior administration official told VOA. \"The Trump administration continues to counter these malign activities.\"\n\n\n\n\"Repeated efforts by the media to seek out disagreement and blame the administration for such divisions play effectively into Moscow's hands,\" the official added.\n\nTrump's defenders say the White House has levied sanctions against dozens of Russians, including some of Putin's oligarchs, while others have been indicted and now face charges in U.S. courts.\n\n\"I made it clear that we wouldn't tolerate meddling in 2018 and that we were prepared to take necessary steps to prevent it from happening,\" U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told reporters following a meeting with his Russian counterpart in August.\n\n\"I tend to look more at the actions than the words. And in this case the actions are pretty strong,\" said Steve Bucci, who served as an assistant to former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy research group in Washington. \"President Trump and his advisers have a pretty tough set of programs for all of those players, and they're executing them.\"\n\nBut even Bucci said the president's rhetoric on Russia has been worrisome.\n\n\"We're shooting ourselves in the foot pretty effectively,\" he said.\n\nNot as bad as 2016\n\nA number of current and former officials believe the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to influence Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections lacked the scale and intensity of its 2016 influence campaign, but they also think Russia did not need to do much.\n\n\"Moscow may, having seen the continuing impact of their 2016 influence operations and the continued political chaos in the U.S. they have engendered, judge that another effort on the scale of 2016 may not be necessary,\" Mark Kelton, a former deputy director of the CIA's National Clandestine Service for Counterintelligence, told VOA in the run-up to the election.\n\nAnd as long as Trump is willing to stoke the fires of political rancor, Russia may not need to add much fuel.\n\n\"If you're sowing discord within a political conversation in the United States, and you can shape that and increase the polarization, then that could have an impact that lasts anywhere from one election cycle to an entire generation,\" said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which studied Moscow's influence efforts ahead of the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nRussia's influence operations, though, have been far from dormant. According to U.S. intelligence officials and court documents, the Kremlin spent more than $35 million from January 2016 through June 2018 on a social media campaign designed to inspire and enrage both sides of the U.S. political spectrum.\n\n\"They're trying to push us to extremes, about whatever we're debating,\" said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA station chief. \"They're winning that.\"\n\nRussian denials\n\nFor its part, Russia continues to deny that it sought to interfere in any way with the U.S. midterm election.\n\n\"We cannot react to some abstract cybersecurity analysts because we do not know who they are and whether they understand anything about cybersecurity,\" Putin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday in Moscow.\n\nYet current and former U.S. intelligence officials doubt Putin, a former intelligence officer himself, has any intention of ending Russia's influence operations, or of ending his use of Trump, though Putin will be careful to protect what he sees as an asset.\n\n\"Putin is paying attention and \u2014 at this point \u2014 trying to do minimal harm to President Trump,\" John Sipher, a 28-year veteran of the CIA who once ran the agency's Russia operations, told VOA in an email.\n\n\"He will gladly toss Trump aside if it suits his interest,\"Sipher added.\"At this point, however, he is in a good place and is likely being careful not to go too far.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Melania Trump Publicly Calls for White House Aide's Firing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/melania-trump-publicly-calls-for-white-house-aide-s-firing/4657196.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "In an extraordinary move, Melania Trump called publicly Tuesday for the deputy national security adviser to be dismissed.\n\n\n\nAfter reports circulated Tuesday that President Donald Trump had decided to remove Mira Ricardel from her post at the National Security Council, Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's spokeswoman, released a statement that said: \"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\n\n\nShortly before the statement was issued, Ricardel was among a group of administration officials and other individuals who stood behind President Trump at a White House ceremony celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the first lady's staff and Ricardel had clashed during Mrs. Trump's visit to Africa in October over such things as seating on the airplane and requests to use the council's resources.\n\n\n\nA White House official told The Associated Press that Ricardel wanted to travel to Africa with the first lady but was denied seating on the airplane because there was no room for her and several others who initially expected to make the trip. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss White House personnel matters, said Ricardel then threatened not to send any NSC staff.\n\n\n\nRicardel also is known to have clashed with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis over Pentagon political appointee choices since early in his tenure. And Pentagon officials have said privately they believe Ricardel had a hand in spreading rumors this year about Mattis falling from favor with the White House and perhaps departing.\n\n\n\nAsked by a reporter today about Mrs. Trump's office saying Ricardel no longer deserves to work in the White House, Mattis said, \"I don't comment on other people's staffing issues.\"\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the National Security Council had no immediate comment.\n\n\n\nMrs. Trump is very protective of her husband and is considered to be an influential adviser, as many first ladies have been with their spouses.\n\n\n\nShe is also one of the most private first ladies in recent memory, which made the public announcement about her displeasure with a top West Wing official all the more surprising.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News during the five-day trip to Ghana, Mali, Kenya and Egypt last month, the first lady said there are people in the White House whom she and the president cannot trust. She declined to name anyone but said she had let the president know who they are.\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"some people, they don't work there anymore.\"\n\n\n\nAsked if some untrustworthy people still worked in the White House, Mrs. Trump replied, \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nAnita McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, said there's a lesson in the current first lady's public pronouncement.\n\n\n\n\"The president supports Mrs. Trump's activities and her work, which should be the signal to the rest of the staff to support her, too,'' McBride, who has worked for three Republican presidents, said via email."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Former West Virginia Coal Mines Turned into Carbon-sucking Forests", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/former-west-virginia-coal-mines-turned-into-carbon-sucking-forests/4657161.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Mist rises from the ripped-up and muddy earth as moist soil meets chilly morning air. This field deep within in West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest looks more like a Game of Thrones battleground than a woodlands restoration project.\n\nThis is how Chris Barton is bringing forests back to Appalachia's old strip mines: with a bulldozer tearing up the soil with meter-long metal teeth.\n\n\"We've had a lot of people kind of look at us twice,\" he laughed.\n\nBarton is a forest scientist at the University of Kentucky. On these former mines, he's found that before he can plant a forest, he has to ravage a field.\n\n\"The really interesting thing is, after we do it, there's no question that that was the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nMore on that later. First, Barton's work lies at a crossroads for Appalachia, and for much of the world.\n\nNot rocket science\n\nCoal mines have stripped away roughly 400,000 hectares of Appalachian forests.\n\nBurning coal for energy is adding more and more planet-warming carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. As the planet heats up, experts warn that simply cutting greenhouse gas emissions won't be enough to prevent potentially catastrophic levels of global warming. CO2 must also be removed from the atmosphere.\n\nCurrently, experimental machines that pull CO2 directly from the air are too expensive to be practical.\n\nHowever, a new report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says effective carbon-removal technology already exists.\n\nIt's not rocket science. It's forests.\n\nThe report says planting trees and managing forests, along with carbon-absorbing farming and ranching practices, are among the most cost-effective strategies that are ready for large-scale use today.\n\nTaking advantage of these natural systems could take care of more than a third of the greenhouse gas reductions needed to prevent devastating climate change, according to another recent study.\n\nTurning red spruce loose\n\nIn Appalachia, no ecosystem is better at capturing carbon dioxide than red spruce forests.\n\nThey're even better than hardwood forests, according to Forest Service soil scientist Stephanie Connolly.\n\nThat's because when deciduous trees lose their leaves in the fall, \"photosynthesis shuts down and the trees go dormant,\" she said.\n\nRed spruce is an evergreen. It continues to photosynthesize and pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere all winter long.\n\nWhen evergreen needles do fall, they decompose more slowly than deciduous leaves, she added. And the year-round shade provided by evergreens keeps the soil cool and decomposition slow.\n\nPlus, these forests are more than just carbon sinks. They also absorb water during heavy rains, preventing flooding; and their soils release water during droughts. They provide habitat for rare species like the Cheat Mountain salamander and the northern flying squirrel.\n\nAppalachia has lost 90 percent of the roughly 200,000 hectares of red spruce forest that once blanketed its mountains. Barton, the Forest Service, and a host of partners are working to return red spruce habitat to a thousand-hectare tract of the Monongahela that was strip-mined in the 1980s.\n\nStuck\n\nBut there's a problem with many of these lands.\n\nAfter the mines closed, they were restored according to best practices of the time. The leftover rock from mining was packed down to prevent erosion and planted with shallow-rooted grass.\n\n\"That's fine for stability,\" Barton said. \"But for plant life, if you went out and planted trees in these sites, they just didn't grow. The ground was way too compacted. Water didn't infiltrate. Roots can't penetrate. Oxygen can't circulate in those environments.\"\n\nDecades later, lands that had been strip-mined and reclaimed were \"stuck.\" Nothing but grass could grow on them.\n\nBarton figured that ripping up the compacted soil would \"unstick\" them.\n\nBut it wasn't an easy sell.\n\nJack Tribble was a new forest ranger at Monongahela when Barton and Green Forests Work approached him. Tribble had already tried and failed to get trees to grow on the site.\n\n\"These guys came to us and said, 'You need to rip this,'\" he said. \"Of course, that doesn't make sense at all to me.\"\n\nBut he approved a 30-hectare trial plot and crossed his fingers.\n\n\"We [had] a piece of equipment the size of a dozer out there ripping the ground,\" he said. \"That's just kind of a scary thing.\"\n\nThat was 2011. Seven years later, he said, \"these trees are just growing really, really well.\"\n\n\"I get it,\" he added. \"I totally get it.\"\n\nCost benefit\n\nThis kind of reforestation is not cheap. Tribble said it costs roughly $5,000 per hectare. He estimates that restoring the most critical areas will add up to about $4 million.\n\nPartnerships with the Nature Conservancy, American Forests, the Arbor Day Foundation and many others have helped with know-how and fundraising.\n\nPlus, he added, the effort is spending money and hiring locally.\n\nBarton said that's an important part of what Green Forests Work is about.\n\nIn Appalachia, where the declining coal industry is shedding jobs, he said, \"the idea was to build an ecological program to restore forests, but also, at the same time, develop an economic program for Appalachia, by putting people to work.\"\n\nRestoration projects need heavy equipment operators. Locals collect seeds from native plants, and local nurseries grow the seedlings. So far, Barton says the Monongahela project has poured about $1 million into the community.\n\nSince 2009, Green Forests Work has planted nearly 2.5 million trees on roughly 1,600 hectares of what used to be strip mines across Appalachia.\n\nIn West Virginia alone, Connolly said, restoring red spruce to its old habitat could lock up the equivalent of 56 million barrels of oil.\n\nNot right away. It takes decades.\n\nNature works slowly. But it works."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Juul Labs to Pull Sweet E-Cig Flavors to Curb Youth Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/juul-labs-to-pull-sweet-e-cig-flavors-to-curb-youth-use/4657198.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Juul Labs, the U.S. market leader for electronic cigarettes, said on Tuesday it will pull popular flavors such as mango, cucumber and fruit from retail store shelves in an effort to reduce surging teenage use of its products.\n\nThe move comes as Juul and other e-cigarette makers have faced heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration amid a sharp increase by high school students in use of the devices, which look like a USB flash drive and vaporize a flavored liquid containing nicotine.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Juul Chief Executive Kevin Burns said the company wants to be \"the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes, not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine.\"\n\nJuul said it will stop selling flavors except for tobacco, mint and menthol in all retail outlets, including convenience stores and vape shops, until retailers can install technology that scans buyers' IDs to independently verify they are 21 or older.\n\nUntil then, popular fruit flavors and other sweet flavors that appeal to younger users will only be available on Juul's website. The company said it uses an age-verification system that requires buyers to enter their social security number, address and birth date, which is verified by a third-party service.\n\nIn addition, the company said it is shutting down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook, and working with social media companies to remove \"unauthorized, youth-oriented content on their platforms\" relating to Juul.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter that \"voluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps FDA will soon take,\" but he acknowledged Juul's actions and urged other e-cigarette makers to take steps to reduce use by minors.\n\n'Juul rooms'\n\nSome of Juul's early social media and Youtube videos included images of attractive young people using the product.\n\nUser-generated social media about Juul became popular over the last two years, with young people posting videos and photos of themselves using the product at school or with friends, often under the hashtags #doit4juul or #juullife.\n\n\"Juuling\" has become synonymous with vaping in high schools across the country, where some teachers and administrators have started locking bathrooms, jokingly called \"Juul rooms\" by students.\n\nThe FDA in September threatened to ban Juul and four other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors. The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that has now ended.\n\nThe agency is expected to announce restrictions on flavored e-cigarette products this week that mirror those suggested by Juul and other manufacturers. A senior agency official last week said the FDA plans to only allow sales of tobacco, mint and menthol flavors in convenience stores and gas stations. Other flavors could still be sold at vape shops.\n\nChanges by companies\n\nJuul said that beginning in early 2017 it required models used in advertisements of its products be older than 35. Earlier this year, it began featuring only former cigarette smokers in its ads to highlight smoking cessation benefits.\n\nJuul has grabbed significant U.S. market share over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nMarlboro maker Altria Group Inc, which sells e-cigarettes under the MarkTen brand, last month said it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to FDA's concerns. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nJames Campbell, a spokesman for the Imperial Brands Plc unit that makes blu e-cigarettes, said the company told the FDA it plans to introduce a technology early next year that would lock devices in an effort to prevent underage use. The company also said it would review its flavors and packaging to minimize youth appeal, strengthen age verification for online sales and terminate contracts with retailers found to sell to minors.\n\nMichael Shannon, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Vapor, a unit of British American Tobacco, said last week the company planned to tell the FDA it would penalize retailers that sell to youth and strengthen online sales restrictions to prevent underage or large bulk purchases of its products."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "WHO Official Predicts 6 More Months Battling Ebola in Congo", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/who-official-predicts-6-more-months-battling-ebola-in-congo/4656814.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The emergencies chief for the World Health Organization predicted Tuesday that Congo\u2019s Ebola outbreak will last at least another six months, saying that informal health facilities have become \u201cmajor drivers\u201d of the current, deadly transmission.\n\nDr. Peter Salama said that makeshift \u201ctradi-modern\u201d health centers \u2014 offering both traditional and modern treatment \u2014 were believed to be linked to more than half of cases in Beni, the largest city affected by the current outbreak that has taken more than 200 lives.\n\nSalama, who returned from a trip to Ebola-hit eastern Congo last week, said Tuesday it appeared \u201cvery likely\u201d that some cases of Ebola had been misdiagnosed as malaria, because early symptoms are virtually identical.\n\nHe said that the WHO is planning on \u201cat least another six months before we could declare this outbreak over.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, people appeared to have contracted Ebola while visiting the centers for other health concerns, Salama said.\n\nHe described the \u201ctradi-modern\u201d centers as popular but unregulated neighborhood facilities that vary from stand-alone structures to \u201cjust a room in someone\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nSalama noted how many residents appear suspicious of foreigners, officials and outside organizations, but that many also believe in the effectiveness of injectable medicines.

Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation\u2019s all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, \u2019God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\u201d Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \u201cWhy are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \u201cYou guys Catholics or something?\u201d He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda\u2019s Ebola Survivors Recall Disease\u2019s Horrors on DRC Outbreak", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4656071.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "As the Democratic Republic of Congo battles the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, just across the border Ugandan survivors of a 2007 outbreak are reminded of the near-death experience they went through.

Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area.

He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers.

Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican presidential nominee in 1996.\n\nWhy does the first lady have an issue with her?\n\nMelania Trump\u2019s beef with Ricardel stems from the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa last month when her staff clashed with the adviser over things like plane seating and requests to use National Security Council resources, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe first lady has also suspected Ricardel of being behind several negative press stories about her. She reportedly discussed the issue with the president during their recent trip to Paris, during which Trump told his wife he would have Ricardel removed.\n\nThe first lady isn\u2019t the only one who has clashed with Ricardel. The adviser also butted heads with Fred Fleitz, former chief of staff and executive secretary for the National Security Council, as well as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other Pentagon officials.\n\nHow does all this relate to chief of staff John Kelly?\n\nKelly has apparently also drawn the first lady\u2019s scorn over travel requests and reportedly denied her repeated requests to promote several aides.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly\u2019s office,\u201d one unnamed White House official told NBC. \u201cPromotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests.\u201d\n\nTASOS KATOPODIS via Getty Images Kelly has reportedly clashed with the first lady over staffing issues.\n\nIs Kelly\u2019s job in trouble, too?\n\nTrump is reportedly considering firing Kelly, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to multiple reports this week. In addition to the first lady, Kelly has reportedly also clashed with both Bolton and Ricardel and has been seeking to get Ricardel fired for weeks. Bolton, meanwhile, has reportedly been pushing for Nielsen\u2019s firing.\n\nThe president has not officially announced any of these terminations. But on Tuesday, he told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about it.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Disney Permanently Bans Trump Fan For Repeatedly Flashing 'Trump 2020' Signs", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dion-cini-banned-disney-world-trump-banner_us_5beb201ce4b0783e0a1d09b8", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "One Donald Trump supporter wanted to make a big splash at Disney World.\n\nIt worked \u2015 sorta \u2015 except now he\u2019s been permanently banned from all Disney properties.\n\nEarlier this month, Dion Cini rode down Splash Mountain at Walt Disney World holding a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d sign above his head.

Antifa activists photographed him at the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. He has posed for pictures in front of Nazi symbols and holding Nazi memorabilia.\n\nOn Gab, the favored social network of racists and anti-Semites, Clark had the username @PureWhitEvil and called himself \u201cDC Bowl Gang,\u201d a reference to Dylann Roof, the bowl-cut racist who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\nHuffPost Jeffrey Clark and his Gab gang made a hero of church killer Dylann Roof.\n\nMany alt-right white supremacists worship Roof, and Clark used an image of the killer and balaclava-clad gunmen as the header for his Gab page. His pinned image was an altered still from the video game \u201cDoom\u201d that depicted Roof executing black people in a church.\n\nHuffPost\n\nThis April, Clark threatened a HuffPost reporter, warning that the reporter would be going \u201cfeet first into a woodchipper.\u201d The reporter told police about the threat in August. They did nothing at the time. In late October, D.C. police did come to Clark\u2019s house in the Bloomingdale neighborhood after the death by suicide of his brother, Edward, but did not arrest him.\n\nClark told family members he had been \u201cfriended\u201d on Gab by Robert Bowers, the man charged with murdering 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. Clark, court documents said, told family members the victims \u201cdeserved it.\u201d He wrote on Gab that the attack was a \u201cdry run for things to come\u201d and that \u201cthe fucking kikes that got shot by the hero #RobertBowers were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to court documents. Pedophilia-centric conspiracy theories are popular among members of the far-right; in 2016, a North Carolina man armed with a rifle drove to a Washington, D.C., pizza place he falsely believed was the center of a vast pedophilia ring. No one was injured in the shooting.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until November, after Clark\u2019s own family contacted law enforcement, that the FBI finally found the allegedly illegal weapons that have him facing gun charges. Court documents, as well as photos and videos obtained by HuffPost, suggest Clark\u2019s late brother, Edward Clark, shared a similar ideology. That both men were able to spew neo-Nazi rhetoric, amass an arsenal of weapons, and openly threaten journalists and critics for months without consequence shows just how much freedom far-right extremists have to operate in the U.S. \u2014 and how far their behavior has to escalate before law enforcement takes it seriously.\n\nWhite Supremacy, At Home In DC\n\nClark lived in a rowhouse in Bloomingdale with his father, sister and younger brother Edward William \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark, who killed himself on Washington\u2019s Theodore Roosevelt Island on Oct. 27, the day of the Tree of Life shooting.\n\nNo one answered the door Tuesday night at the Bloomingdale home, which was completely dark except for a television flickering in an upstairs room.\n\n\u201cI was waiting for these boys to step out of line,\u201d one neighbor, who asked for anonymity out of concern for their safety, told HuffPost. That neighbor, who was aware of Clark\u2019s neo-Nazi leanings and monitored his Twitter account, said that the Clarks, until a few years ago, were one of the only white families on the block, which is in a historically black neighborhood near Howard University that has gotten dramatically whiter and richer in recent years.\n\nI was waiting for these boys to step out of line. A neighbor of Jeffrey and Edward Clark\n\nThe neighbor said that last year several similarly dressed white men gathered at the Clark home around the time of an alt-right free speech rally in the city. The neighbor heard the group chanting what sounded like \u201cSeig Heil.\u201d When white supremacy flyers appeared in the neighborhood and a gay pride flag was torn down from the window of the nearby bar Showtime, the neighbor suspected the Clark boys were involved.\n\nLaura Sennett Jeffrey Clark, far left next to his brother Edward.\n\nFinding Their Place In The Far-Right\n\nThe Clark brothers appear to have been trying to find their footing in the far-right political scene over the past several years, showing up at \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d rallies outside the White House or at events with Spencer. One of them tried to join Identity Evropa, a prominent white nationalist organization, but was rejected, according to a source in the organization.\n\nIn May 2017, the Clark brothers teamed up with far-right \u201cPizzagate\u201d propagandist Jack Posobiec, who was then the D.C. bureau chief for the far-right website Rebel Media, to shoot footage for a film Posobiec was working on about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer whose murder near the Clarks\u2019 home in Bloomingdale has spawned numerous far-right conspiracy theories.\n\nLaura Sennett, an anti-fascist researcher who works with One People\u2019s Project, spoke with Jeffrey Clark a few weeks after he and his brother were spotted in Bloomingdale with Posobiec, who by then had been fired from Rebel under mysterious circumstances after plagiarizing Jason Kessler, the white nationalist who organized the Unite the Right rally.\n\n\u201c[Clark] told me that Jack Posobiec hired him and his brother to follow him with a camera to take video of his investigation of Seth Rich,\u201d Sennett told HuffPost. \u201cNot sure if it was a documentary or a news story, but [Posobiec] was doing some kind of reporting for Rebel Media. I asked him if Posobiec was aware of his Nazi beliefs. He told me that Posobiec absolutely was and had told Jeff that he was sympathetic to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nPhoto taken by a source who spotted Jack Posobiec Conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec being followed by the Clark brothers as they videotape him.\n\nPosobiec, who is now a host for the conservative One America News Network, did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.\n\nJeffrey Clark also found a common cause with violent white supremacists on Gab, where he posted neo-Nazi propaganda and promoted prominent white nationalist voices such as Patrick Little, Brad Griffin, Jared Wyand and \u201cJack Corbin\u201d \u2015 all of whom Tree of Life shooter Robert Bowers also engaged with on the social media platform. He amplified older white nationalists such as Billy Roper and Peter Brimelow, and expressed his support for white nationalist Republican Senate candidate Paul Nehlen.\n\nClark\u2019s Gab profile picture was a photo of him and his brother wearing masks and holding guns in front of a flag with a skull and crossbones, according to court documents. The skull has a bowl haircut, another reference to Roof. Edward Clark went by \u201cDC_Stormer\u201d on Gab, according to the FBI. A Twitter account with the same user name is currently suspended. Previously, that account, which antifa activists believed to be linked to one or both of the Clark brothers, posted thinly veiled threats aimed at local antifa activists.\n\nSeveral of the internet service providers who worked with Gab abandoned the social media platform after the Pittsburgh shooting brought public attention to how easy it is for leading extremists to connect with individuals on Gab who might carry out white nationalism\u2019s violent ideology.\n\nHuffPost\n\nRegarding death threats, here's a note from right-wing Jeffery Raph Clark, @dc_stormer, who lives in DC area and has come to #antifa events. pic.twitter.com/bTRTQRH2By \u2014 Lacy MacAuley (@lacymacauley) July 4, 2017\n\nHow It All Came Crashing Down\n\nThe Clarks\u2019 history of extremism ended in the death of one brother and the arrest of another over the past two weeks. Edward Clark killed himself with a Beretta pistol on Oct. 27 sometime before 12:45 p.m., according to court documents. Responding officers found eight remaining rounds in the magazine of his pistol, as well as two additional magazines of ammunition with 20 more rounds. Family members told FBI agents they were surprised by Edward\u2019s suicide and did not know why he had so many bullets on him.\n\nCourt documents imply that Jeffrey knew his brother was up to something unusual on the day of his death. Jeffrey woke up around noon that day. When he realized Edward wasn\u2019t home, he called his mother and said he was going to report Edward missing to the police, even though Edward was 23 and hadn\u2019t been gone for long.\n\nJeffrey is the registered owner of a Remington Arms 1911 R1 handgun and a Mossberg Maverick 88 shotgun. He brother was the registered owner of a Ruger Mini 14 Ranch Rifle and a Beretta 92FS handgun, the gun he used to kill himself. Officers later recovered a Colt .38 Jeffrey gave to a family member that was not registered to either Clark brother. D.C. law requires registration of all firearms with local police.\n\nA D.C. homicide detective went to the Clarks\u2019 home after Edward\u2019s death. Jeffrey told him that Edward\u2019s rifle was still at the house, but the detective did not ask Jeffrey about his guns, according to court documents.\n\nTwo family members called the FBI on Nov. 2 to express concerns about Jeffrey Clark, whom they said had become more outspoken about his white nationalist views after his brother\u2019s death. Jeffrey and Edward \u201chad both fantasized about killing \u2018Jews and blacks,\u2019\u201d and admired mass murderers Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson, according to court documents. Family members told the FBI that Jeffrey was \u201creally riled up\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d and they feared he would hurt himself or others. The brothers believed there would be a race revolution, and they wanted to expedite it.\n\nFamily members showed FBI agents four boxes of gun parts they took from Jeffrey, including parts used to modify AR-15 assault rifles. Agents also found four high-capacity AR-15 magazines that can hold up to 30 rounds of ammunition. Possession of such magazines is prohibited under D.C. law.\n\nJeffrey and Edward\u2019s relatives confirmed they both attended the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. They believed there were photos of the brothers online standing next to James Alex Fields, the white supremacist who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others. They showed FBI agents a picture of the brothers holding a flag for the white supremacist group Vanguard America \u2015 the same group on the flyers posted around Bloomingdale.\n\nFBI agents spoke with one of the relatives again on Nov. 8. The relative told them that Jeffrey smoked and sold marijuana. They also observed propane torches in the house that are \u201cconsistent with those used for smoking methamphetamine,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nJeffrey described himself on Gab as \u201cAka DC Stormer (RIP), \u201cMeth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright, Glenn beck, Not a NEET \u2013 just bathing in White priviledge, Bowlcut Nationalism is the only way forward. . .\u201d\n\nClark was arrested on Friday and charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-speed magazine.\n\nDavid Bos, the federal public defender assigned to Clark\u2019s case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "John Mayer Reveals Why He Gave Up Drinking After Drake's Birthday Party", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mayer-drinking-drake-birthday_us_5beaef8be4b0caeec2be6683", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cSome people still say, \u2018That guy\u2019s a dick,\u2019\u201d Mayer told the magazine. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Well, any of that data you\u2019re working off of is really old.\u2019 I mean, I can tell you for sure that I haven\u2019t been a dick in many years.

She modernized the organization and attracted a new generation to the reproductive rights movement with a period tracker app, a new brand, look and logo, and the award-winning virtual reality film \u201cAcross the Line\u201d about the personal experience of getting access to abortion. She developed the group\u2019s powerful political advocacy arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and built partnerships with other progressive organizations. Since 2010, she has helped fend off 21 attempts by Congress to defund the health care provider.\n\n\u201cDawn must feel good and should feel good about the last week\u2019s elections,\u201d Richards told HuffPost, referring to the Democrats\u2019 takeover of the House of Representatives, \u201cbecause she had a huge role to play.\u201d\n\nLaguens remembers well the day that Richards recruited her: It was Christmas Day in 2010. President Barack Obama had just passed his signature health care bill, Republicans had swept the House of Representatives in the midterms, and then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) had decided to use his party\u2019s new majority to take aim at Planned Parenthood.\n\nPence introduced an amendment that would strip federal funds from Planned Parenthood, kicking off a Republican war against the family planning provider that has lasted eight years. Richards, the iconic face of Planned Parenthood, needed help with her first big battle against Congress. She called her friend Dawn Laguens from an airport on Dec. 25.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day,\u201d Laguens said. \u201cWhen the phone rang, I thought, \u2018Oh, how nice that is of Cecile, to be giving me Christmas greetings on Christmas Day!\u2019\u201d\n\nRichards sounded urgent. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Egypt,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I get back, I need you to come in and help put together the fight against the Pence Amendment.\u201d\n\nDawn Laguens (right), outgoing vice president of Planned Parenthood, and former President Cecile Richards are seen in an undated photo.\n\nLaguens, who owned her own political consulting firm at the time, stepped in to help Planned Parenthood as Republicans threatened a government shutdown over its funding. She won that first battle and then couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave. \u201cI fell in love with the people, more than anything, and the mission, more deeply,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed about seven and a half years longer than I ever planned.\u201d\n\nAs executive vice president, chief brand officer and chief experience officer, Laguens has helped lead the nation\u2019s largest family planning provider through a tumultuous time in its 100-year history. In addition to fending off dozens of defunding efforts from Congress and the states, Planned Parenthood has had to brawl with outside groups \u2015 sometimes unexpected ones.\n\nIn 2012, the charity Susan G. Komen for the Cure tried to pull breast cancer grants from Planned Parenthood because one of its executives, Karen Handel, opposed abortion rights. But Planned Parenthood immediately mobilized its supporters, and the backlash against Komen was so strong that the charity quickly apologized, forced Handel and other officials to resign and reinstated the grants.\n\nIn 2015, an anti-abortion activist group called the Center for Medical Progress hit Planned Parenthood with a series of heavily doctored undercover \u201csting\u201d videos that purported to show the provider trafficking fetal body parts. Those videos were debunked \u2015 but they gave Republicans in Congress a pretext to open a federal investigation into Planned Parenthood and attack its funding again. (The investigation turned up nothing.)\n\nLaguens has partnered with other progressive organizations, including the National Women\u2019s Law Center, to help implement the birth control benefit in the Affordable Care Act. She also grew Planned Parenthood\u2019s c4 electoral program to be one of the largest and most effective in the country, and built an innovative strategy to attack the stigma around abortion.\n\nRichards said she stepped down from the helm of the organization after a decade in part because she felt confident in Laguens.\n\n\u201cI think one of the reasons why I felt like I was able to step aside was that such a strong foundation has been laid, a real movement has been built,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I hope she\u2019s proud of that and the difference it made in the lives of millions of people.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood is entering a new era now. Dr. Leana Wen, its new president, has a plan to depoliticize abortion and incorporate it in the public imagination with all other kinds of basic women\u2019s health care. Laguens plans to take some time off to spend with her family \u2015 her partner and their triplet daughters. She hasn\u2019t figured out her next career move yet, but she wants to continue to innovate within the reproductive rights movement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won these elections, and it\u2019s a great moment to make a switch and think about how I can tackle some of these challenges that new technologies can be applied to,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stay close to the fight \u2015 I can\u2019t imagine that I will go far away from it.

Of course, a family\u2019s cultural and religious background may steer the discussion, but there are certain guiding principles that are helpful for everyone to keep in mind.\n\nHere are some expert suggestions for parents and caregivers when they prepare to talk about death and grief with children.\n\nBe Honest And Straightforward\n\n\u201cTell them the \u2018facts\u2019 about the death,\u201d clinical psychologist John Mayer told HuffPost. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat what death is or use \u2018baby talk\u2019 with a child. Do not use phrases like, \u2018Grammy is sleeping.\u2019 This is an opportune time to teach them about death. Don\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d\n\nBoard certified licensed professional counselor Tammy Lewis Wilborn echoed this sentiment, noting that using \u201ccutesy language\u201d and euphemisms in an attempt to protect kids from the realities of death and loss can actually do more harm than good.\n\nkali9 via Getty Images Avoid using euphemisms when explaining death to children.\n\n\u201cChildren tend to think concretely, not abstractly, so when you use language that\u2019s euphemistic, it can actually be more confusing or frustrating,\u201d she explained. When people say things like \u201cDad is in the clouds\u201d or \u201cYour dad is taking a really long nap,\u201d a young child may not understand the permanence of the fact that their father died and might even look for him in the clouds or expect him to wake up at some point.\n\nWords like \u201cdeath,\u201d \u201cdied\u201d or \u201cdying\u201d may sound harsh, but this is still developmentally appropriate language, Wilborn noted, and it\u2019s important for children to have the language to understand the permanence of death.\n\nAsk And Answer Questions\n\nThe kind of conversation a parent has with a child following the death of a loved one depends on the child\u2019s relationship with the person who died. It should also vary based on the child\u2019s developmental age and their understanding of what happens when someone dies. To that end, it\u2019s useful to ask kids questions or offer to answer any questions they might have.\n\n\u201cStarting with questions can be a way in,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t necessarily need to give the specific details of how the person died, particularly if we\u2019re dealing with traumatic grief. They don\u2019t need all of the information, but they need enough age-appropriate details to understand that a person has died and isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d\n\nSometimes children may have witnessed something related to the loved one\u2019s death, like being present at the scene of an accident or visiting the person in the hospital. In these cases, they need help understanding what they saw, said Chandra Ghosh Ippen, an expert in early childhood trauma and the associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nParents should try to shrink themselves down to the size of their child and walk through what they\u2019ve experienced. Seeing someone in a hospital with tubes coming out of them or watching paramedics perform lifesaving procedures may be frightening for a small child, so it\u2019s necessary for adults to appreciate how scary things might look to them.\n\n\u201cCreate space for them to share how it might\u2019ve affected them, and try to help them understand that doctors and paramedics were trying to help their loved one,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained.\n\nsot via Getty Images Know that the conversation around death and grieving will be ongoing.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing conversation. \u201cYoung children will often come back to you after your very excellent explanation of death and still ask, \u2018Am I going to see so-and-so?\u2019\u201d Ghosh Ippen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t understand you, but little kids tend to repeat their questions. It\u2019s sort of their way of mulling it over and making meaning. This can be painful for caregivers, but appreciate that the child did hear you and is just having a difficult time wrapping their head around the concept of death.\u201d\n\nKnow That Their Emotions Are Complicated\n\n\u201cGrief is a complex process, so it comes with a range of thoughts, emotions and behaviors,\u201d Wilborn explained. While parents may expect their child to feel sad, angry, confused or even guilty about a loss, there are other behavioral changes that can be harder to understand, like changes in sleeping and eating patterns or school performance issues.\n\nSometimes parents may feel confused about a perceived lack of sadness in their kids. \u201cYoung children have a short sadness span,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile adults tend to immobilize and sink into sadness, kids often discharge it by running around or trying to do something else. \u201cThey kind of go in and out of sadness, and that can put us at odds with them if we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh, my God, do they not care?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cBut recognize that they did care.\u201d\n\n\u201cA child can suffer a devastating loss and feel really sad, and then they can go play. You may be thinking, \u2018Were they really affected by what happened?\u2019\u201d - Chandra Ghosh Ippen, associate director of the Child Trauma Research Program at the University of California, San Francisco\n\nBe Patient\n\nWilborn noted that grief is a long process, so parents should reject the tendency to want to rush past it and wonder when their kids are going to be over it.\n\n\u201cGrief is a process that you cannot go around. You have to go through it. So you need to be OK with the pace of the process,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can take some time for a child to return to his or her normal.\u201d\n\nMayer emphasized the power of this experience and of talking to kids about death as a way to build major developmental coping skills. \u201cThis is a positive and helps them cope with loss in their life in the future and even transitions in their life, such as leaving one school to another, advancing to high school or college, and losing relationships.\u201d\n\nEncourage Expression\n\n\u201cChildren need to see that their parents are a resource; home is a resource where grief is welcome,\u201d Wilborn said, noting that parents should encourage age-appropriate expressions of grief.\n\n\u201cFor example with a school-aged, play is their language, so you want to lean into ways that children play to promote communication \u2015 things like drawing pictures, playing games, dolls, puppet shows at home,\u201d she added. \u201cWith older kids, you might encourage them to journal, draw, write songs, create poems.\u201d\n\nMayer noted that being a resource for your child creates a sense of safety and security that will serve them in later life events. \u201cThey know they can depend on you, and it is wonderful modeling for them.\u201d\n\nCreate Rituals\n\nCreating rituals around remembering and honoring a loved one who died is another significant form of expression. \u201cExplain that this person may not be here with us, but we can still remember him or her and celebrate their life as a family,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\n\u201cWhen the death is really traumatic, sometimes caregivers stop talking about the person who died,\u201d Ghosh Ippen explained. \u201cAnd what\u2019s hard in those cases is that children lose their \u2018angel memories\u2019 \u2015 times when they really felt loved and cared for with that person. It\u2019s normal for grown-ups in mourning to find it hard to talk about the person who died, but it\u2019s important to memorialize them.\u201d\n\nasiseeit via Getty Images Losing a loved one offers an opportunity to talk to your child about your cultural and religious beliefs.\n\nMany cultures and religions promote rituals around saying goodbye and making meaning of death. Mayer noted that losing a loved one presents an opportunity for parents who have religious belief systems to explain these tenets to their children.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away,\u201d he explained. \u201cSay something like, \u2018Where\u2019s Aunt Susie right now? She\u2019s not in this room with us right now, correct? That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 Aunt Susie is here (point to your head) and here (point to your heart). We have to keep our memories and good times with Aunt Susie alive.\u201d\n\nMake Sure They Know It\u2019s Not Their Fault\n\n\u201cSometimes children have this really uncanny way of assigning blame to themselves for things that have nothing to do with them,\u201d said Wilborn.\n\nWith that in mind, caregivers need to help kids understand that the death is in no way their fault, and it\u2019s not their responsibility to put on a strong face or hide their feelings.\n\n\u201cReligious or not, it is also very helpful to teach your children that all the experiences and memories you have had with this loved one do not get erased with their death. People always live in our hearts and our minds forever, and no one or nothing can take that away.\u201d - clinical psychologist John Mayer\n\nUse Books And Other Resources\n\nThere are many great resources for parents navigating this difficult topic with their children. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn both recommend Sesame Street\u2019s online grief toolkit, which provides talking points, videos, activities, storybooks and more. Ghosh Ippen and Wilborn also pointed to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network as another great source of online resources.\n\nLittle, Brown Books for Young Readers There are many children's books that cover the experience of loss.\n\nBeyond books and online resources, Wilborn emphasized the value of community resources, such as school counseling, support groups, play therapy and peer counseling.\n\nLet Them See You Grieve\n\nThe way a child\u2019s parents or caregivers respond to a loss is instrumental in helping them cope. \u201cThey need to see you grieve,\u201d said Wilborn. \u201cBut they also need to see you taking care of yourself and engaging in self-care, which may or may not include professional help. If you don\u2019t, they may feel like they have to take care of you because you\u2019re not managing grief in a way that\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s OK to cry in front of your children and show the value of expressing emotions and having shared emotions among family members. It\u2019s OK to say things like \u201cI\u2019m feeling really sad because my dad died\u201d or \u201cDaddy is sad because he misses his mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin our culture, we often have a sense that we have to be tough, so many parents are trying to help their kids by putting on a brave or overly cheery face,\u201d said Ghosh Ippen. \u201cBut that can seem really odd and confusing. The child is feeling sad because it\u2019s devastating that this person is gone, but then the parent is cheery \u2015 which can feel eerie and weird.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about conveying the idea that \u201cMom is sad, and Mom is also strong,\u201d she continued. If the feelings of grief become overwhelming, parents should seek help from other sources because it\u2019s not their child\u2019s role to help them."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "HBO's \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 Discriminates Against Blind People", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hbo-discriminates-against-blind_us_5be073e1e4b04367a87f1cab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "I\u2019ve watched the trailer for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d the first installment of HBO\u2019s adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, about 30 times.\n\nI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Announces New Headquarters In Virginia, New York City", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-hq2-new-york-virginia-queens_us_5beae68fe4b0783e0a1c8db0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "SEATTLE \u2015 Amazon today announced that it has selected New York City and Arlington, Virginia, as the locations for the company\u2019s new headquarters.\n\nAmazon will invest $5 billion and create more than 50,000 jobs across the two new headquarters locations, with more than 25,000 employees each in New York City and Arlington.\n\nThe new locations will join Seattle as the company\u2019s three headquarters in North America.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-14 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013. (Rubin disputes the claim.)\n\nGetty Editorial Google employees at its European headquarters in Dublin join others around the world in walking out of their offices on Nov. 1 in protest over claims of sexual harassment, gender inequality and systemic racism at the tech giant.\n\nThe company gave three executives similarly cushy treatment, even though it did not have any legal obligation to do so, the Times found.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we have terminated 48 people, including 13 senior managers and above for sexual harassment,\u201d Pichai noted in his email. \u201cNone of these people received an exit package. And to clarify: in that time, we have also not provided any exit packages to executives who departed voluntarily in the course of a sexual harassment investigation.\u201d\n\nEvent organizers published a list of five demands for protesters to coalesce around, including pay equity, greater transparency at several levels in Google and an end to forced arbitration agreements.\n\nWe, Google employees and contractors, will walkout on November 1 at 11:10am to demand these five real changes. #googlewalkout pic.twitter.com/amgTxK3IYw \u2014 Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) November 1, 2018\n\nProtesters at the walkout in New York City hoisted signs calling out sexual misconduct and gender inequity in tech, with at least a couple of pointed references to Rubin\u2019s payout.\n\n\u201cHappy to quit for $90 million,\u201d read one woman\u2019s sign. \u201cNo sexual harassment required!\u201d\n\nThe first of many coordinated #GoogleWalkout protests has begun - this is at the firm\u2019s office in Singapore.

John Schoettler, the executive who oversees Amazon\u2019s real estate, negotiated with the private developers.\n\nDuring one visit, the Amazon executives visited the Cornell Tech campus, a new high-tech school on Roosevelt Island, and took the ferry from there to Long Island City.

On another occasion, they took the ferry at sunset.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the past few weeks that things really took off.\n\nGov.

The company\u2019s lawyers appeared to know about those pitfalls and wanted to avoid them. So Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo agreed to let the state control the approval, meaning there could be local input but no local veto.
