Three other deaths occurred in the Woolsey Fire in Southern California, making the statewide death toll from wildfires 74.\n\nWith more personnel able to take reports from phone calls and emails and add names from 911 calls on the day the fire broke out, the number of names on the missing list swelled for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe Camp Fire -- the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history -- has destroyed about 9,700 homes and scorched 146,000 acres (an increase of 5,000 acres Friday). It is 50% contained.\n\nA report from the state firefighting agency said: \"Today firefighters continued to make progress.\"\n\nSearchers work at a property in Paradise where human remains were found Friday.\n\nHundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, anthropologists and coroners are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to visit the region Saturday. Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom plan to accompany him.\n\nSmoke from the large wildfire has prompted several universities to cancel or postpone sporting events. That includes the University of California, Berkeley men's basketball game Thursday night, which was called off, and its football game, which was rescheduled for December 1.\n\nScores reported missing\n\nThe number of names on the Camp Fire's missing list soared Thursday and Friday, but authorities said they are struggling to confirm whether all of them are still unaccounted for.\n\nHonea has said investigators combined all the information they have received from callers since the fire erupted more than a week ago. Some names on the list appear more than once, and it's unclear whether others are duplicates, too, Honea said.\n\nOfficials have said it's hard to determine the number of missing. Some people who may have evacuated can't be reached because cell phone service is unreliable. Others haven't reached out to relatives, and they may not know someone is looking for them, he said.\n\n\"I want you to understand,\" Honea said Thursday, \"that there are a lot of people displaced, and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them.\"\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office published the list on its website. If people find their names on the list, Honea said, or names of loved ones they know are safe, they're asked to call the sheriff's office.\n\nFor two days, Paradise police Officer Matthew Gates searched through ash and collapsed buildings for the remains of a woman.\n\nWhen the Camp Fire broke out, a man told Gates his mother was likely driving on a jammed roadway that hundreds used to flee the flames. But Gates couldn't find her.\n\nThen Gates finally came across her at an evacuee shelter.\n\n\"She had burns up her arms and I knew it was her,\" the officer told CNN affiliate KRCR . \"I went and gave her a hug because I've been looking for her body.\"\n\nAuthorities are trying to reach those who called 911 to verify they've made contact with their loved ones, said Collins of the Butte County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"We're asking people to call us if they do come in contact with their loved one so that we don't spend time looking for somebody that's already found.\"\n\n'I see flashbacks of the fire'\n\nA week after her family narrowly escaped as the Camp Fire closed in on the town of Paradise, Whitney Vaughan said she feels like giving up.\n\nEverything she and her husband, Grady, own is gone, along with a home they were renting, \"a quirky older house with lots of character and lots of room\" for their six kids, she said.\n\nThankfully, her two kids and his children are able to stay with the other parents, but Vaughan said she and her husband are essentially homeless. One night they just began driving from town to town in search of a motel.\n\n\"So now we are homeless, have no money, are trying to find a place,\" Vaughan said. \"And if that isn't bad enough, when I do close my eyes, I see flashbacks of the fire and the people trapped on our streets. The explosions and the screams will never be a sound that I can forget.\"\n\nThe \"quirky older house with lots of character\" that Vaughan's family was renting no longer exists.\n\nVaughan said she's worried about how she's going to explain to her 7-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son that she'll likely have to move away while they find some level of stability.\n\n\"There are just too many people in the same situation,\" she said. \"I don't know what to do anymore. We have nowhere to turn.\n\n\"This fire has changed us in ways I can never explain.\"\n\n3 deaths in Southern California\n\nMeanwhile, the Woolsey Fire in Southern California has claimed three lives and destroyed 548 structures in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nMore than 98,000 acres have been burned since the blaze began November 8, while evacuees remain in shelters and portions of Malibu and nearby areas must be rebuilt, officials said.\n\nMore than 3,300 firefighters are making progress against the massive wildfire, which was 67% contained as of Friday.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote. Some students, even those without pre-existing conditions, said they felt sick.\n\n\"I had a bloody throat, bloody nose, a cough, dry and watering eyes, and my throat is still very sore and dry,\" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. \"I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter.

But May is going to face down her most vocal critics in the most public, damning way imaginable.\n\nBriefly, back to the deal. The sticking point -- what happens on the island of Ireland -- seems to come down to essentially one question: is it more important for the UK to have an independent trading policy or to have a hard border between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which will remain a part of the UK? Everything else -- laws, borders, even money -- hangs on this question being answered.\n\nFor the record, it's worth pointing out that a hard border is something the EU and the Republic of Ireland absolutely will not tolerate.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear now that having both is not possible.\n\nMay's deal with the EU, her supporters would tell you, gets as close to both options as is ever going to be possible. Still, it's not enough for large sections of the UK parliament, who will have a say on the deal when May has it signed off in Brussels.\n\nJUST WATCHED British PM Theresa May strikes Brexit deal with cabinet Replay More Videos ...

These concerns vary from shaking the shackles of EU law and regulation to maintaining access to the EU's single market. Some even want to chuck the whole thing and rejoin the EU.\n\nSo why on earth would the Prime Minister take the vote to the Commons knowing there's a real chance she could lose? Why is she not changing course and going back to Brussels to try for more concessions?\n\nMay has a habit of hanging on and proving us all wrong. Ever since she lost her majority in Parliament in last year's election, her leadership has been in constant question. But on she goes.\n\nIt could be brinksmanship. It could be confidence. It could even be a direct challenge to her own party: back me or push me.\n\nAll day, we have heard rumors of her MPs submitting letters of no confidence in her leadership, a process that could lead to a vote that could dislodge her as Prime Minister.\n\nOr not. There is still the very real possibility that she could win such a vote and strengthen her position among her own MPs. But even at that point, the arithmetic of Parliament would remain something of a mystery.\n\nAnd it's a mystery that needs solving very soon. Businesses, investors, employers and diplomatic allies want clarity.\n\nAnd until that mystery is solved, the real costs will stack up. The pound will continue to be volatile, jobs will continue to be put at risk and economists will continue to tear their hair out.\n\nBut this isn't about economics; it's about the mayhem in a country whose politics have barely functioned in 2018."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Easter Islanders to visit London in bid to get statue back", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jq2qbSKGlIU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Written by Jack Guy, CNN\n\nA delegation from Easter Island is preparing to visit London to ask for the return of a huge statue from the British Museum.\n\nThe 2.5-meter basalt figure has been part of the museum's collection since 1869 -- but now the islanders want it back.\n\nEaster Island, known as Rapa Nui in the local language and governed by Chile, is famous for the moai statues that dot its landscape.\n\nA delegation including Carlos Edmunds, president of the council of Rapa Nui elders, and Felipe Ward, Chile's minister for national property, will travel to London to underline the significance of the moai and discuss its future.

Two days after the fire, Delbert still hadn't heard from Dorothy.\n\nHe, too, tried calling her home phone, and the Ridgewood Mobile Home Park where she lives. Neither number worked.\n\n\"Her birthday is today,\" Mack told CNN on Friday. Dorothy, a cancer survivor, turned 88.\n\nNow, Bechtold, Mack and hundreds of other people wait for news -- anything that will give them a molecule more hope.\n\n'We're desperate to find an answer'\n\nEven though their calls wouldn't go through, the families didn't stop trying.\n\nBechtold would call his mother's numbers every now and then, just to test the phone lines; maybe a call would get through somehow. Mack and his family began calling people who live in the same mobile home park.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fire, they tried to speak with people still in the area, asking them to drive by Dorothy's property. In recent days, Mack's entire family has been calling hospitals, hoping that Dorothy had checked in.\n\nBoth have joined Facebook groups organized to connect loved ones with people who are missing.\n\nA neighbor told Steven Paul, Mack's son-in-law, that she owes her life to Dorothy's property manager going around all the homes and telling people to leave.\n\nThe only thing left of Dorothy's house at 6674 Pentz Road Space 19 is, \"ashes and sheet metal.\" Her car is not there.\n\nBechtold drove to Paradise and pinned up flyers with her picture at shelters. They called hospitals, shelters -- anyone who possibly could help.\n\n\"We're desperate to find an answer,\" Mack told CNN. \"Everyone in the family is anxious. And they're expecting me to give them positive information. I have no information to give them.\"\n\nAuthorities scramble to locate hundreds\n\nAs the full extent of the damage came into view, with almost the entire town of Paradise reduced to ash, it was clear the Mack and Bechtold efforts needed to escalate with the filing of a missing person report.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Department says family and friends wanting to file should call 530-538-6570, 530-538-7544 or 530-538-7671.\n\nCallers must speak to a person, rather than leave voicemails.\n\nAnd they are urged to provide an update if they hear back from their missing loved ones.\n\n\"We are right now going off of people that have called in either welfare checks or to report someone missing,\" Investigations Sgt.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote.

My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter.

Hide Caption 93 of 93\n\nThe questions over the use of the emergency alert system come as firefighters continue to battle the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe fire's rapid spread through the town of Paradise and beyond left at least 56 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes and structures, making it the most destructive and deadliest blaze in state history.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butte County sheriff published a list of more than a hundred people unaccounted for and still missing from the Camp Fire. The blaze, which has burned 140,000 acres, remains just 40% contained.\n\nHonea said that, for now, Butte County would continue to focus on assisting CalFire on fighting the Camp Fire. Once the fire is contained, they will go back and look closer into the emergency alert system, he said.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of requests and calls from people who want us to spend a lot of time going back and collecting data and there will be a time for that, but right now I need to focus on the fight in front of us,\" Honea said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape 02:15\n\nAs Honea noted, the speed of the fire took everyone by surprise and left residents of Paradise scrambling to escape in car and on foot.\n\nThe Camp Fire charred 20,000 acres last Thursday in less than 14 hours . Its most significant growth period was early Thursday afternoon, when it grew 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes -- burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time.\n\n\"We did our absolute best in terms of Amber-style alert, we used emergency mass notification system as well as our efforts to notify people when we're in the communities. We employed that,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea offered several other explanations for why the alerts did not reach people in harm's way.\n\nHe said the fire took place in a remote area where cell phone service may not be great. He also said that some people who received the warning may not have acted immediately to get out, and suggested that people may have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding fires.\n\n\"I don't think it would be appropriate to draw the conclusion that because (bodies) were found in their house, you can automatically assume they were not notified,\" he said. \"It is possible that they were notified but they chose not to heed the warning and we have heard of stories like that.\"\n\n'For the most part, our plan worked'\n\nMayor Jones said that the fire simply moved too quickly, especially compared to 2008's devastating fire season.\n\n\"I mean, it just happened so fast. There wasn't time to give anybody longer. In 2008, we had three hours between the first notice and the mandatory evacuation. We had three hours to pack up stuff,\" she said.\n\nThis time, though? \"We had no time at all. Maybe five minutes,\" she added.\n\nAbout 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento. Jones estimated that about 80 to 90% of the town was destroyed.\n\nStill, despite the issue with the alert system, she defended the evacuation plan, calling it \"organized chaos.\"\n\n\"It did take time to get everybody through just because so many people were evacuated at the same time,\" she said. \"But I think for the most part, our plan worked. If we hadn't had that plan, it would have been awful.\"\n\nLast October, officials in Northern California faced similar criticism from residents who said they learned of the fire by the smell of smoke or noise from their pets rather than from an emergency alert.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Huston, then the deputy director for California's Office of Emergency Service, said alerts and warnings happen on a local level, not a state level.\n\n\"They decide what are the appropriate alerts for their population,\" Houston said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered journalist's death, official says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/oijvWPCAGc4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The CIA has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite the Saudi government's denials that the de facto ruler was involved, according to a senior US official.\n\nThe senior US official told CNN on Friday the conclusion is based on a recording provided by the Turkish government and other evidence, including American intelligence.\n\nInvestigators also believe an operation such as the one that ended in Khashoggi's death would not have happened without bin Salman's knowledge given his control of the government, the senior US official said.\n\nA Saudi Embassy spokeswoman said in a statement that \"the claims in this purported assessment are false. We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations.\"\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report on the CIA's assessment.\n\nAccording to the Post, US officials have high confidence in the CIA's assessment.\n\nA spokesman for the CIA declined to comment to the Post. The Saudi government has denied bin Salman's involvement in Khashoggi's death.\n\nKhashoggi, a former Saudi royal insider who became a critic of the country's government, went missing in October after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers for his upcoming marriage. The Saudi government offered changing explanations for Khashoggi's disappearance.\n\nIncluded in the US intelligence analyzed by the CIA was a phone call the prince's brother Khalid bin Salman made to Khashoggi, encouraging the journalist to make the trip to the consulate to get the documents, according to the Post. Sources told the Post that Khalid made the call at his brother's command.\n\nKhalid denied the Post's reporting, saying on Twitter that he had never spoken to Khashoggi by phone.\n\n\"I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the US government to release any information regarding this claim,\" Khalid said.\n\nHe said the last contact he'd had with Khashoggi was via text in October 2017.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told the Post that Khalid, who is the Saudi ambassador to the US, and Khashoggi never discussed \"anything related to going to Turkey.\"\n\nThe CIA also examined an audio recording from inside the Saudi consulate provided by Turkey and a phone call placed from inside the consulate after Khashoggi was killed, according to the Post.\n\nMaher Mutreb, an alleged member of the Saudi hit team and a security official for the crown prince, placed the phone call to a top aide for bin Salman informing the aide that the job had been done, people familiar with the call told the newspaper.\n\nThe CIA does not know the location of Khashoggi's remains, according to the Post.\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday imposed penalties on 17 individuals over their alleged roles in the killing of Khashoggi. Khashoggi's assassination has created a crisis for the Trump administration and drawn attention to President Donald Trump's business ties to Saudi Arabia and the relationship between bin Salman and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Saudi Public Prosecutor's Office said 11 people had been charged for their involvement in the death of Khashoggi, adding that five are facing capital punishment for being directly involved in \"ordering and executing the crime.\"\n\nKhashoggi was killed following \"a fight and a quarrel\" at the Saudi consulate, the prosecutor's office claimed. Prosecutors said Khashoggi was tied up and injected with an overdose of a sedative that killed him. Then, according to prosecutors, his body was dismembered and removed from the consulate by five people."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says he's written answers to Mueller questions, isn't 'agitated' by probe", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/X1nNYtVYH08/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday he was personally crafting the answers to special counsel Robert Mueller and denied he was agitated by the state of the probe.\n\n\"I write the answers.

Bill Nelson's already improbable path towards victory in a recount has gotten narrower, with the Democrat suffering a series of setbacks in court and in county election offices across the state.\n\nThe drumbeat of relatively bad news for Democrats in Florida has left any chance Nelson had of overtaking Republican Gov. Rick Scott's 12,603 vote lead in a recount as a longshot, at best, with the three-term senator needing to win an overwhelming number of votes in the ongoing manual recount or scoring a series of clear wins in court.\n\nNelson was handed a consequential loss early on Friday morning when Judge Mark Walker ruled that the guidelines Florida law provides to election canvassing boards as to how to determine voter intent in a manual recount are constitutional.\n\n\"The issue in this case is whether the use of these reasonable and neutral rules is constitutional,\" Walker said. \"It is.\"\n\nThe loss came around the same time Walker denied a request for Scott to recuse himself from election matters.\n\nNelson's lawyer's -- led by top Democratic attorney Marc Elias -- have argued the mere fact that the race went to a manual recount was enough of a win for them, given the number of votes in Democratic leaning counties that remain left to count.\n\nThey have kept a particularly close watch on Broward and Palm Beach counties, where election officials have said the number of overvotes -- when a voter selects too many candidates in one race -- and undervotes -- when a voter selects no candidates in one race -- number in the thousands. The manual recount currently underway is only of those ballots, where election officials use guidelines from the state of Florida and their own judgment to determine whether a voter meant to vote to one candidate or another.\n\nIn Broward County, the number of over and undervotes was over 30,000 ballots. In Palm Beach County, that number was around 6,000, according to Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher.\n\nThose votes now represent the only chance Nelson has to close the gap, and even then, the likelihood is dim.\n\nBroward County elections officials announced on Friday morning that they had completed sorting their over and under votes, and the county's canvassing board was now reviewing the ballots and would announce the decision of those in dispute, meaning the intent of the voter was clearly in question.\n\nBucher, who testified before Walker's court on Thursday, told the judge that her team would finish the machine recount on the Senate race on Friday and then need three to five hours to complete the hand recount. She said that all could happen at some point on Friday.\n\nElias tried to project confidence on a call with reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"It has never been our view that there was going to be one silver bullet that was going to change the margin in this race,\" Elias said, noting that Democrats' strategy has long been that they would need a series of wins in court and with election officials to bring home a win for Nelson.\n\nTo date, that hasn't happened.\n\nNelson's lawyers did score a narrow win on Thursday when Walker ruled voters whose mismatched signatures disqualified their provisional and mail-in ballots and who were \"belatedly notified\" of the problem have until Saturday at 5 p.m. to correct those signature problems.\n\nBut even that victory was muted. Lawyers for Nelson and other Democrats had asked for the ballots in question to be counted with no review of the signatures at all. And even though Elias and others celebrated the ruling, Uzoma Nkwonta, a lawyer for Nelson's campaign in the case, told the judge in the hearing that a ruling that only extended the deadline by a few days -- which is what Walker ordered -- \"would probably be insufficient.\"\n\nWalker also denied a request on Thursday that would have made it easier for Nelson's campaign to reach out to voters who had mismatched signatures on their ballots. The lawyers had asked for the judge to require the Florida Secretary of State to release the names of people whose ballots had not been counted because their signatures did not match ones on file. Walker, quite directly, took a dim view of that argument and rejected it from the bench.\n\n\"I am not going to be used by either party,\" Walker told the lawyers. \"That's the kind of gamesmanship that would undermine our democracy further.\"\n\nAnd Walker also rejected the Democrats' request to remove the state's deadlines for machine and manual vote recounts on Thursday.\n\n\"This Court must be able to craft a remedy with knowledge that it will not prove futile. It cannot do so on this record,\" Walker wrote. \"This Court does not and will not fashion a remedy in the dark.\"\n\nThe hits kept coming on Friday evening, when Walker denied a motion from lawyers for VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations who were seeking to stop the state of Florida from enforcing the vote-by-mail deadline. The suit argued that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and their ballots should be treated similar to ballots mailed from overseas, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not agree, meaning Florida's vote-by-mail deadlines will stand and domestic vote by mail ballots received after Election Day will not be counted.\n\nScott's campaign heralded the decision, arguing that it showed it was \"long past time for Bill Nelson to face the facts: this charade is over, Floridians' votes have been counted multiple times, and Rick Scott is the next Senator from Florida.\"\n\nSome decisions remain for Walker, however, and they could go Nelson's way. VoteVets Action Fund and a series of Democratic organizations urged Walker on Thursday to invalidate Florida law that says domestic mailed ballots must arrive in elections offices by election night. The suit argues that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service and should be treated similar to overseas mailed ballots, which have a later deadline.\n\nWalker did not indicate on Thursday how he would rule on the matter, but even if he does rule in favor of the Democratic interests on the matter, it is unlikely to be enough vote to close the Nelson's deficit.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote. Some students, even those without pre-existing conditions, said they felt sick.\n\n\"I had a bloody throat, bloody nose, a cough, dry and watering eyes, and my throat is still very sore and dry,\" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. \"I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts, with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to \"asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul, vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.

About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.\n\nScientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.\n\n\"The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThey were previously commonly referred to as \"Siamese twins,\" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated, they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexiteer cabinet ministers in plan to shift May on EU deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46243745", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images/PA/Getty Images/EPA/Reuters Image caption Michael Gove, Liam Fox, Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling and Penny Mordaunt\n\nA group of five ministers in Theresa May's top team are hoping to persuade her to make changes to her draft Brexit deal, the BBC understands.\n\nLeader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom is believed to be co-ordinating the group.\n\nThe five ministers include Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.\n\nMrs May published her draft withdrawal agreement with the EU on Wednesday, and has vowed to \"see it through\".\n\nThe 585-page document sets out the terms of the UK's departure and includes details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens rights.\n\nThe deal prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.\n\nSome Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.\n\nAsked if she was prepared for a challenge, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said: \"I think the prime minister is ready for anything.\"\n\nOn Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other ministers to change a specific part of the draft withdrawal deal regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth sides want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nBrandon Lewis, party chairman and a cabinet member, said it was right that colleagues across the cabinet would want to have their say.\n\nHe said he thought the five would be looking at the longer, future agreement with the EU.\n\nA source said of Theresa May's deal: \"Even if you don't mind it ideologically, you can't be fooled about getting it through the Commons.\"\n\nThe source suggested that if changes weren't made, resignations from Brexiteers still in the cabinet were \"not off the table\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nWhisky for May\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was \"not everybody's ideal deal\" but said her job was to make \"tough decisions\" and \"find a way through\".\n\nShe also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.\n\nCommenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been \"a pretty heavy couple of days\".\n\nShe revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her \"rock\", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast.\n\nShe added: \"He does feel some of it (the hurt) himself - he's bound to.

So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

in a significant increase in CO\u2082 emissions, scientists warn.\n\nThat could mean attaining the Paris climate agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C could become harder, they say.\n\nPresent emission-cut pledges by countries are projected to increase the average global temperature rise by more than 3C by the end of the century.\n\nThat would lead to dangerous climate change impacts, experts say.\n\nThese include sea level rise, drought, wildfires, among other extreme events.\n\n\"We can't neglect the emissions from wildfires,\" says Ramon Vallejo, a scientist specialising on fire ecology with the University of Barcelona.\n\n\"Particularly now that we are seeing intense wildfires all around the world.\"\n\nEstimates and uncertainties\n\nAlthough estimates vary and still carry uncertainties, some experts say wildfires account for up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey are estimated to increase by a few percent to roughly 30% by the end of this century depending on how the climate changes.\n\n\"It is a double whammy,\" said William Lau, atmospheric scientist with Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\n\"Big forest fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the

time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Exoplanet discovered around neighbouring star", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46196279", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun.\n\nNearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes.\n\nThe planet's mass is thought to be more than three times bigger than our own, placing it in a category of world known as a \"super-Earth\".\n\nIt orbits Barnard's star, which sits \"just\" six light-years away.\n\nThe star is an extremely faint \"red dwarf\" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature, Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9 and colleagues say its newly discovered planetary companion has a mass 3.2 times bigger than the Earth's.\n\nDr Anglada Escud\u00e9 said it was \"possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report says 'cut lamb and beef'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46214864", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report.

Congress is putting pressure on him now. The CIA is evidently briefing people, possibly against Trump's wishes,\" Simmons said.\n\n\"So what is next? There may be an international investigation, or a joint US-Turkey investigation. However, the bottom line is; this case has escalated so dramatically now. The news about the CIA assessment is a thunderbolt, seemingly confirming the suspicions of so many people,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera from Singapore, Evan Resnick of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies said the reports of the CIA assessment \"are highly credible\".\n\n\"This basically reconfirms what most of us already suspected, that the plot of the assassination goes right to the top of the Saudi regime and the crown prince,\" Resnick said.\n\n\"It is explosive but the question is; how credible will the president of the United States see this evidence? It is an open question as to how seriously he will take this intelligence, even as most of us take it quite seriously. Clearly, he has many reasons to want to whitewash this case, the foremost being his police to contain Iran, for which Saudi Arabia is acting as his lynchpin,\" Resnick added."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi case: All the latest updates", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-case-latest-updates-181010133542286.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Saudi Arabia has admitted Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul.\n\nKhashoggi - a Saudi writer, US resident and Washington Post columnist - entered the building on October 2 to obtain documentation certifying he had divorced his ex-wife so he could remarry.\n\nAfter weeks of repeated denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance, the kingdom eventually acknowledged that the murder was premeditated.

She then faced a David-and-Goliath-like quest for justice against her well-connected abductor.\n\nMonths of re-victimising proceedings ended in a conviction of her assailant on lesser counts. This prompted her to seek justice elsewhere. She studied law and took her case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Fewer than one in 100 petitions ever reach this international tribunal, and this was the first time Venezuela was before the Court for gender-based violence.\n\nIn its decision on Friday, the court held Venezuela responsible, \"because of its gross omissions\", for the torture and the sexual slavery Lopez suffered, as well as for preventing her access to justice.\n\n\"Today I can tell the women of Venezuela and Latin America that have not been able to obtain justice for the violations of their rights within their countries that a reparation is obtainable,\" said Lopez. \"This is positive jurisprudence that can be used to protect the human rights of women across Latin America and around the world.\"\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThe court ordered Venezuela to revisit the criminal case, pay Lopez and her family compensation, and provide for her lifelong medical and psychological care. The ruling also asked Venezuela to finance any further post-secondary studies for Linda and her siblings, whether in Venezuela or abroad.\n\nThe ruling equally ordered Venezuela to acknowledge its responsibility in a public act of recognition and establish prevention mechanisms to prevent such cases from recurring. This includes a curriculum on gender-based violence and discrimination, to be incorporated into the national education system at all levels, which will explicitly bear the name \"Linda Loaiza\".\n\n'Historic precedent'\n\nAlthough the court's decision is only binding in Venezuela, it creates a powerful international precedent that could benefit women worldwide.\n\nWhat makes this case so unique is that it tested the state's responsibility for the actions of a private citizen. By nature, human rights cases have focused on the actions of State officials.\n\nLopez's lawyers argued that by failing to act, investigate, punish or prevent the extreme violence she faced, the state was guilty of \"acquiescence\" and thus responsible for violence committed by a non-state actor. They also argued that state prosecutors revictimised Lopez over years of traumatic and discriminatory court proceedings.\n\nThis ruling is also the first within the Inter-American System to classify violence against a woman committed at the hands of an individual as torture.\n\n\"This decision by the Inter-American Court sets an historic precedent in terms of violence against women and the discrimination they frequently face when accessing justice,\" said Elsa Meany, Senior Attorney with the Washington-based Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL).\n\n\"It could lay the foundations for Venezuela to carry out structural changes in its laws, public policies and administration of justice,\" Meany said in a statement.\n\nShe told Al Jazeera prior to the decision that Lopez herself has helped develop guidelines to ensure appropriate medical care for victims of gender-based violence, so their treatment won't do further harm.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nLiliana Ortega, one of Lopez's representatives from CoFAVIC, detailed her tireless efforts to inspire other survivors during a court hearing in February.\n\n\"She has managed to transcend her own personal story in favour of a collective quest. A well-deserved and recognized human rights defender, Linda is an example of courage, persistence and resistance,\" Ortega said.\n\nWhen the state of Venezuela executes the full content of the sentence, I'll be able to speak about justice. Until then, impunity persists. Linda Loaiza Lopez Soto\n\nPointing out that Venezuela does not have a great record of complying with court decisions, Meany said its response could be \"complicated by the fact that Venezuela is undergoing a crisis of massive political and economic proportions, and we don't know what the outcome will be in the short-term.\"\n\nVenezuela was informed of the ruling earlier this week, but have not responded to the decision. Officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nDuring the hearing, Venezuela's lawyer accepted the state's failure to ensure a proper criminal investigation in Linda's case, or a fair trial within a reasonable timeframe. He also apologised on behalf of Venezuela for \"the inadequate performance of the organs of the justice system in the criminal proceedings to punish the terrible acts of violence against women that [Lopez] suffered.\"\n\nLopez said she's encouraged by the silence-breaking #MeToo movement and hopes her story will inspire survivors to report violence to police and persevere in seeking justice.\n\nBut after so many years of legal disappointments, she is careful not to get ahead of herself.\n\n\"When the state of Venezuela executes the full content of the sentence, I'll be able to speak about justice.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

The challengers have said they need further evidence from Ross and other officials about whether there was an unlawful political motivation behind the decision.\n\nOpponents of the citizenship question have said it would disproportionately affect Democratic-leaning states\u2019 electoral representation and federal funding. The administration has said more precise citizenship data is needed to better enforce a voting rights law in order to protect minorities.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has pursued hard-line immigration policies seeking to limit legal and illegal immigration. He has sought to portray immigrants who enter the United States illegally across the border with Mexico as a national security threat.\n\nNY trial wrapping up\n\nIt was unclear if the high court\u2019s decision to hear the case will affect how Furman handles the trial, which began Nov. 5 and has closing arguments scheduled for Nov. 27.\n\nTime is an issue as the final census forms are to be printed by spring 2019.\n\nThere has not been a census question about citizenship status since 1950. The plaintiffs have said that in recent decades Census Bureau officials have opposed adding a citizenship question because of the risk of driving down response rates and undercounting the U.S. population.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution mandates a census every 10 years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump's AG Appointment Challenged at Supreme Court", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-ag-appointment-challenged-at-supreme-court-/4662339.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "The fight over President Donald Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general has reached the U.S. Supreme Court, with lawyers in a pending gun rights case asking the justices on Friday to decide whether the action was lawful.\n\nCritics have said the Republican president's Nov. 7 appointment of Whitaker, who now will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, to replace the ousted Jeff Sessions as the chief U.S. law enforcement official violated the Constitution and federal law.\n\nLawyers for Barry Michaels, who filed a lawsuit in Nevada challenging a U.S. law that bars him from buying a firearm because of prior nonviolent criminal convictions, decided to make Whitaker's appointment an issue in their pending appeal before the high court because Sessions was named as a defendant in the case.\n\nThe lawyers told the justices that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should be the acting attorney general.\n\n\"There is a significant national interest in avoiding the prospect that every district and immigration judge in the nation could, in relatively short order, be presented with the controversy over which person to substitute as acting attorney general,\" the lawyers, led by prominent Supreme Court advocate Thomas Goldstein, wrote in a court filing.\n\nThe court is not required to decide one way or another and could simply ignore or reject the motion.\n\nMichaels' lawyers argued that Rosenstein, the department's No. 2 official, should have succeeded Sessions under a federal law that vests full authority in the deputy attorney general should the office of attorney general become vacant.\n\nMaryland case\n\nSome of the same lawyers behind Friday's motion also are involved in a similar effort brought before a federal judge on Tuesday. In that case, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh asked a federal judge to bar Whitaker from appearing in an official capacity as acting attorney general in the state's ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration over the\n\nAffordable Care Act health care law.\n\nMaryland also argued that Trump violated the so-called Appointments Clause of the Constitution because the job of attorney general is a \"principal officer\" who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday defended the legality of Whitaker's appointment, saying Trump was empowered to give him the job under a 1998 law called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act even though he was not a Senate-confirmed official.\n\nCongressional Democrats have voiced concern that Whitaker could undermine or even fire Mueller. Mueller's investigation has led to criminal charges against a series of former Trump aides and has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Questions Linger Over Legitimacy of  Trump's Acting AG Pick", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/questions-linger-over-legitimacy-of-trump-s-pick-for-acting-attorney-general-/4662222.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Since his contentious appointment last week, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has gone about business as usual, signing Justice Department documents, issuing statements in support of White House policies, and crisscrossing the country to deliver speeches before law enforcement groups.\n\nYet controversy lingers over his abrupt rise to the top Justice Department post, with questions swirling about the constitutionality of his appointment and its implications for the independence of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker now supervises the probe.\n\nWhitaker's elevation has been dogged by allegations that he has engaged in political partisanship and shoddy business dealings. In a published essay last year, he wrote that the Mueller investigation had \"gone too far.\" He later suggested shutting down the probe by cutting off funding for the office of the special counsel.\n\nWhitaker has also been tied to at least one target of the Mueller investigation. In 2014, he headed the failed campaign of Republican Sam Clovis for Iowa treasurer. Clovis went on to serve as a national co-chairman of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and has testified before the grand jury investigating the Russian interference. Critics have cited the link in urging Whitaker to recuse himself from the probe.\n\n\"There are two things at stake,\" said Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank. \"At the biggest and highest level, it's about whether or not the Senate will retain the power to act as a check against a president in his appointing authority. More narrowly but also importantly, it's about whether or not a presidential loyalist is going to take charge of the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nRooted in politics\n\nWhitaker served as a U.S. attorney in southern Iowa from 2004 to 2009. Later, he worked as a conservative political and legal commentator, and served on the boards of several companies. After a failed run for the U.S. Senate in Iowa in 2014, Whitaker ran a conservative ethics watchdog before joining the Justice Department in October 2017.\n\nTrump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Nov. 7 and asked Whitaker to take over as acting attorney general, bypassing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump had repeatedly criticized Sessions for his recusal from oversight of the Mueller investigation. Sessions had recused himself on the advice of Justice Department ethics officials because he'd served as an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\nWhitaker's appointment drew criticism from members of both parties.\n\nFormer Republican attorneys general Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey questioned whether Trump could legally put someone in charge of the Justice Department without the approval of the Senate.\n\nGonzales, who served as attorney general from 2005 to 2007 under former President George W. Bush, told NPR last week that he had \"some issues\" with Whitaker's selection. Mukasey, who succeeded Gonzales in the Bush administration, questioned whether Whitaker \"qualifies under the Constitution\" to serve as acting attorney general.\n\n\"The question is whether somebody who is acting would have to be someone who has been confirmed, and there are people available who have been confirmed,\" Mukasey said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nThe state of Maryland has challenged Whitaker's appointment as part of ongoing litigation with the Justice Department.\n\nPresidential power\n\nWhitaker was appointed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law that allows the president to appoint certain senior officials as heads of agencies.\n\nLegal scholars said the appointment faced constitutional and legal hurdles. Under the U.S. Constitution, the attorney general must be approved by the Senate. And under the Attorney General Succession Act, the deputy attorney general becomes acting attorney general in the event of a vacancy at the top.\n\nWhitaker has not addressed the questions surrounding his appointment. However, the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides advice to the executive branch, issued an opinion Wednesday defending the legality and constitutionality of his new role.\n\n\"As all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\" the 20-page ruling said.\n\nCritics are unpersuaded. Rosenzweig called the opinion an \"extreme view\" handed down by an office that is \"in the business of advancing executive power.\"\n\n\"I'd say that can't be right,\" he said. \"It cannot be right that the president has that much power.\"\n\nThe controversy over Whitaker's appointment is likely to become moot once Trump announces a permanent nomination. But just how long Whitaker can survive the onslaught of attacks remains to be seen."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Says Will Name EPA's Acting Chief to Post Permanently", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-will-name-epa-s-acting-chief-to-post-permanently/4662209.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Andrew Wheeler, a former lobbyist who has led the Environmental Protection Agency since his scandal-plagued predecessor resigned earlier this year, got President Donald Trump's nod Friday for the permanent job.\n\nTrump made the announcement almost in passing at a White House ceremony for Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees.\n\nSingling out Cabinet members in the audience at the ceremony, Trump got to Wheeler, \"acting administrator, who I will tell you is going to be made permanent.\"\n\n\"He's done a fantastic job and I want to congratulate him, EPA, Andrew Wheeler.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889.\n\nBut now, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: Some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \"the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\" which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nJon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said the vote left him \"a basket case\" and \"extremely emotional.\"\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" he said. \"That was just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\"\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the edge of Paris and collectively known as the \"heir and the spares,\" will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses decay over time.\n\nBenefits of the change\n\nThe change will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won't suddenly get kinder and kilos and grams won't change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition of the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the new formula for the kilo, now also known as \"the electric kilo,\" cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time, or be dropped and damaged.\n\nIt is expected to be more accurate when measuring very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in new innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields.\n\nWith time, as the science behind the new definition becomes more accessible and affordable, it should also mean that countries won't have to send their own kilograms back to France to be checked occasionally against Le Grand K, as they have done until now, to see whether their mass was still accurate."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Somalia Struggles to Treat PTSD from War, Poverty", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-struggles-to-treat-ptsd-from-war-poverty/4661120.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Somalia's 30 years of chronic conflict have left an estimated 1 in 3 people affected by mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

He hopped barefoot from the prow, climbed a muddy slope and stared once more at what he'd lost.\n\nNot long ago, the clearing had been home to mangroves, saltwater-loving trees that anchor a web of life stretching from fish larvae hatching in the cradle of their underwater roots to the hornbills squawking at their crown. Now the trees' benevolent presence was gone, in their place a swath of stripped soil littered with felled trunks as gray as fossils.\n\n\"Do you think we can find any food in this place now?\" asked Bondien, a village leader of the Tombonuo people. \"The company thinks it can do anything it wants \u2014 that we don't count.\"\n\nThe company is Sunlight Inno Seafood. Owned by Cedric Wong King Ti, a Malaysian businessman known as \"King Wong,\" it has bulldozed swaths of mangroves in the Tombonuo's homeland in northern Borneo to make space for plastic-lined ponds filled with millions of king prawns. The shrimp are destined to be fattened for three months, scooped up in nets, quick-frozen, packed into 40-foot refrigerated containers and loaded onto cargo ships bound for distant ports.\n\nGargantuan as it may seem to Bondien and his relatives, the project represents only a speck in the global aquaculture industry, one of the world's fastest-growing sources of protein.\n\nUnfolding across Asia and around the world, this revolution in farming could help mitigate the impacts of climate change \u2014 or make them even worse.\n\nAs the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases causes the world's oceans to warm, ecosystems that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago are being upended in less than a human lifespan. Across the planet, fish and other marine creatures are being forced into a desperate search for cooler waters. Even coral is on the move: Some Japanese reefs are expanding northward at up to nearly nine miles per year, researchers have found.\n\nTropical seas may be the hardest hit. Species in the once-stable conditions near the equator could find it much harder to tolerate even mild temperature increases than hardier cousins at higher latitudes, which are used to coping with the contrast between summer and winter.\n\n\"If you ask me what is the No. 1 concern that I have on climate change effects on fisheries, it is on these tropical, developing countries,\" said William Cheung, director of science at the Nippon Foundation-University of British Columbia Nereus Program. \"The sheer speed of the change will make it that much harder for marine life to adapt.\"\n\nCoral reefs, as vital to tropical fish as trees are to birds, are becoming more vulnerable to a process called bleaching, which occurs when a spike in water temperatures causes coral to expel the algae that provide their kaleidoscopic colors, leaving them prone to starvation or disease. Today, swaths of the once-psychedelic Great Barrier Reef in Australia have turned boneyard white and largely devoid of life.\n\nScientists fear a similar fate could await the Coral Triangle, a huge underwater wonderland east of Borneo endowed with a trove of biodiversity comparable to the rainforests of the Amazon Basin. Millions of people depend on its bounty to survive, a large share of them Malaysians, who eat an average of 125 pounds of fish each a year \u2014 more than double the world average.\n\nWith climate change bearing down on the tropics, the search is on for a more sustainable way of getting food from the sea, one that doesn't take more than nature can give.\n\nFarther to the north on Borneo, an island divided among Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, villagers are raising sea cucumbers: curious-looking creatures resembling giant slugs that are typically braised and served with oysters, mushrooms and spring onions, or \u2014 if you're in Japan \u2014 thinly sliced, flavored with wasabi and eaten raw.\n\nThese echinoderms, close relatives of sea urchins and starfish, may not appeal to every palate. But farming them has one of the lightest footprints of any form of food production, a reminder of the vast untapped global potential for harvesting oysters, mussels, clams and many other types of filter-feeders.\n\nA couple of hours' drive from the Sunlight Seafood shrimp farm, inhabitants of the stilted village of Mapan Mapan have created a maze of sunken enclosures fenced with a barnacle-covered mesh.\n\nImmersed waist-deep in one of these briny paddocks, sea-cucumber farmer Astinah Binti Jamari plucked one of the sandpaper-skinned creatures from the seabed. It responded by squirting her with a jet of saltwater \u2014 a defense normally used to scare away crabs.\n\nA revolution in fish\n\nForty years ago, only 5 percent of the world's fish production was farmed. After decades of rapid growth, aquaculture reached a tipping point in 2013, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, when the amount the industry raised in cages, tanks and ponds outweighed the tonnage of freely swimming fish hauled from lakes, rivers and seas for people's plates.\n\n\u200bIn many respects, the industry has a good-news story to tell. Farmed salmon, for example, can convert feed into edible protein far more efficiently than cows or pigs, while producing fewer greenhouse gases. Now, almost all the salmon sold in restaurants and supermarkets is raised in captivity, with Norway, Chile and Scotland the biggest producers.\n\nBut this phenomenal expansion has come at a cost. The appetite for farmed species is so voracious, almost 20 percent of the annual catch from the world's seas is ground into fishmeal, a nutrient-rich powder that forms the basis of the feeds used from salmon cages in Scottish lochs to shrimp ponds on Borneo. Vast amounts of fish have been taken from poorer countries to feed species destined for the plates of wealthier consumers. In addition, shrimp farms, in particular, have made coastal communities in the tropics even more vulnerable by cutting down mangroves, their first line of defense against extreme weather and rising sea levels.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, the aquaculture industry has led to the destruction of more than 1.3 million acres of mangroves spread across Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil and Ecuador, according to a 2013 paper in the Bulletin of Marine Science. Untreated waste and epidemics of shrimp-killing diseases mean the gains can be short-lived: A study published this year identified more than half a million acres of abandoned shrimp ponds in Indonesia alone.\n\nNevertheless, some governments in Southeast Asia and Latin America have concluded that it's worth sacrificing more mangroves in return for the export earnings and employment the projects can generate. Among them is the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is a partner in King Wong's shrimp farm.\n\nHope of a better life\n\nIn 2013, representatives of Sunlight Seafood offered leaders of the Tombonuo and other indigenous communities a deal. In return for some of the land flanking the tidal creeks where their mangroves stood, locals recalled, the company would provide running water, electricity and much-needed employment for youths in the surrounding area, known as Pitas.\n\nFive years since the bulldozers went to work, Tombonuo community leaders say they've lost more than 2,000 acres of mangroves and that the jobs and infrastructure they were promised haven't materialized.\n\n\"I have no words. It's like we've lost our whole world,\" said Samad Samayong, a Tombonuo elder, surveying a sacred outcrop consecrated by his ancestors that is now encircled by shrimp ponds. \"We only realized what was happening when it was too late.\"\n\nOn the other side of a fence, a lone worker trudged past carrying a large bag of Royal Dragon brand shrimp feed on his shoulder. He didn't seem to notice Samayong and other Tombonuo watching from the trees.\n\nSunlight Seafood didn't respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment made by telephone, email and a letter hand-delivered to its office in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah. Reuters also contacted a law firm in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, that had acted for the company in the past but received no reply.\n\nSunlight Seafood has issued statements to Borneo media saying the project was built on land long earmarked for aquaculture by government officials, and that it is boosting the economy in Pitas, one of the poorest districts in Sabah.\n\nThe sheer scale of the farm is only fully apparent from up close. In July, a Reuters reporter and photographer accompanied Samayong, Bondien and others on a three-boat party to various points where water from the ponds gushed from pipes, leaving foamy trails of scum in the creeks.\n\nIt took hours to trace even a portion of the fence enclosing the site. The barrier's stark edges cut a jarring contrast to the tangle of mangrove roots straddling saltwater and land, their branches home to proboscis monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, blue-eared kingfishers and storks.\n\nThe Sabah Environmental Protection Association, a nongovernmental organization, says Sunlight Seafood has already cut down 2,300 acres of mangroves, citing satellite imagery.\n\n\"They cleared the mangroves with no proper consultation with the community,\" said the group's president, Lanash Thanda. \"They have to redress the wrong they have done.\"\n\nApart from losing more trees, Samayong and Bondien fear diggers will further encroach on their ancestral shrines, such as an eerie riverbank guarded by a spirit husband and wife.\n\nVisiting on his boat, Bondien dedicated a cigarette he had rolled from mangrove bark to the couple, placing it on an altar made of branches.\n\n\"It's not only the forest that's being destroyed,\" said Mastupang Somoi, another member of the Tombonuo. \"It's our identity.\"\n\nTrees provide buffer\n\nWith evidence mounting that mangroves represent an effective buffer against climate impacts, some tropical countries are starting to question the gusto with which they once felled the trees, which can take 15 years to mature.\n\nWere it not for the way mangroves served as shields, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami could have taken many more than 220,000 lives. The trees can also help mitigate the impact of rising sea levels: Their multi-tiered root systems trap sediment to raise the land around them relative to the encroaching waves.\n\nEqually ingeniously, mangroves sequester more greenhouse gases than almost any other type of forest, as well as serving as natural larders of fish, birds, fruit and the kind of snails you can eat raw by snapping their conical shells and sucking out the innards.\n\n\"If you catch a fish in the open sea or off a coral reef, it may well have spent part of its life in the mangroves,\" said Dan Friess, an associate professor of geography at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSabah's government says it is committed to striking a balance between economic development and preserving Borneo's extraordinary natural heritage, including by designating extensive areas of forest as nature reserves for threatened orangutans and creating Malaysia's largest marine protected area.\n\nEarlier this month, Junz Wong, Sabah's agriculture minister, toured the Sunlight Seafood farm and said the company had operated \"quite professionally\" and created nearly 400 jobs. On his Facebook page, Wong said he had rejected a company request to cut down an additional 1,000 acres of mangroves. \"I told them NO,\" he wrote. \"No more destroying of mangroves.\"\n\nIn July, a Reuters reporter visited Sunlight Seafood's offices in a suburb of Kota Kinabalu and hand-delivered a letter summarizing the Tombonuo community's grievances and requesting an interview with owner Wong or another company representative.\n\nWhile the reporter was explaining the purpose of the letter to a worker who had been sent to meet him at the door, a security guard cut their conversation short and escorted the reporter off the premises. The guard then closed the gate to the driveway. It bore a large sign in red letters warning that trespassers would be prosecuted.\n\n\u200bFood without a face\n\nNestled in sea-cucumber farmer Jamari's palm, the specimen she had fished from the seabed convulsed with a slow-motion shudder. Jamari, once a struggling single parent, says the creatures came to her rescue, earning her enough money to put her five children through school and build a new house.\n\n\"The sea cucumbers are my treasure chest,\" she said. \"I can't even imagine what life would be like without them.\"\n\nMapan Mapan has earned so much money from its sunken farms that it has declared an annual sea cucumber \"birthday\" festival, at which villagers give thanks by stewing a share of their harvest in a communal meal.\n\nChinese traders have been importing sea cucumbers for more than a thousand years. Served at royal banquets, they were considered both a status symbol and an aphrodisiac. A Ming Dynasty book published in 1602 called \"Miscellanies of Five Items\" lists them as \"sea ginseng.\"\n\nThis mystique drives much of the appetite today. In the decade that ended in 2016, global production of sea cucumbers more than doubled to nearly 275,000 tons, according to the FAO.\n\nAt top Chinese restaurants, the echinoderms are used to make one of the world's most expensive soups, a broth called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall that can sell for $400 and needs to be ordered five days in advance.\n\nIrwin Wong is a manager at Oceandrive, a Malaysian seafood company that buys the sea cucumbers for export. He served as an adviser when Mapan Mapan started cultivating the creatures eight years ago in a 20-farmer pilot project backed by the local government. He says the scheme is harvesting wild sea cucumbers at a sustainable rate, but that even better management could help Borneo produce many more.\n\n\"Perhaps this is the lowest impact of all aquaculture activities,\" Wong said, standing on a platform overlooking a planned new phase, to be built with barnacle-proof mesh and more durable epoxy-coated stakes. \"It can seriously go very big.\"\n\nResearchers believe there is enormous potential to scale up global production of plankton-eaters such as scallops, clams, oysters, cockles and other bivalves \u2014 and, of course, sea cucumbers.\n\n\"The current way of feeding ourselves is simply not sustainable,\" said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research in Bremen, Germany. \"I think on a global level we have to start thinking about the lower levels of the marine food chain, such as bivalves, when it comes to supplying our proteins.\"\n\nScientific advisers to the European Union agree. They concluded last year that it should be possible to harvest a combined 165 million tons annually of bivalves and seaweed \u2014 almost double the world's annual landings of wild-caught fish.\n\nThe beauty of these creatures is that, unlike farmed fish or prawns, they don't require any feed apart from the nutrients they absorb from the sea. No mangroves have to be felled to culture them. Neither do they spew tons of fish waste or chemical pollutants. In fact, bivalves actually remove toxins from the water; a single oyster filters 50 gallons of seawater a day.\n\nYet even as the risks posed by climate change bring the potential of shellfish, seaweed and sea cucumbers into sharper focus, it is also putting them in danger. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, seawater is rapidly becoming more acidic. There is already evidence that acidification can make mussels' shells more brittle, or weaken their grip on rocks, leaving them at greater risk of being swept away by advancing waves.\n\n\u200b\u2018Preserve every species\u2019\n\nLife has been kind to the prize specimens at the Borneo Marine Research Institute: mammoth tropical fish known as giant grouper, which can weigh as much as a person, and in some cases have been swimming in spirals in silo-like tanks for almost 20 years. The only drama happens at feeding time. When fresh sardines hit the surface, the fish dart through the water with torpedo force.\n\nTheir wild relatives will have to work a lot harder to survive.

The VA already is using meditation, yoga and similar approaches to supplement traditional therapy with PTSD, said Paula Schnurr, executive director of the VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD.\n\nWhile the three-month study adds to evidence supporting these lifestyle practices, Schnurr said, more research is needed to learn how long meditation\u2019s benefits last.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no follow-up in this study,\u201d Schnurr noted, and one therapist did 80 percent of the exposure therapy so the findings hinge largely on one therapist\u2019s skills.\n\nResearchers measured symptoms in about 200 San Diego area veterans randomly assigned to one of three groups. Some learned to meditate. Others got exposure therapy. The third group attended classes where they learned about nutrition and exercise.\n\nAll sessions were once a week for 90 minutes.\n\nAfter three months, 61 percent of the meditation group improved on a standard PTSD assessment, compared to 42 percent of those who got exposure therapy and 32 percent of those who went to classes. When researchers accounted for other factors, meditation was better than the classes and equally effective as exposure therapy.\n\nThe researchers defined success as at least a 10-point improvement in scores on a standard symptoms test, given to participants by people who did not know which kind of treatment they\u2019d received. The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it\u2019s not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nMore interest, styles\n\nThere\u2019s growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably less threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in something like meditation.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Report: Russia Has Access to UK Visa Processing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-russia-access-uk-visa-processing/4661884.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Investigative group Bellingcat and Russian website The Insider are suggesting that Russian intelligence has infiltrated the computer infrastructure of a company that processes British visa applications.\n\nThe investigation, published Friday, aims to show how two suspected Russian military intelligence agents, who have been charged with poisoning a former Russian spy in the English city of Salisbury, may have obtained British visas.\n\nThe Insider and Bellingcat said they interviewed the former chief technical officer of a company that processes visa applications for several consulates in Moscow, including that of Britain.\n\nThe man, who fled Russia last year and applied for asylum in the United States, said he had been coerced to work with agents of the main Russian intelligence agency FSB, who revealed to him that they had access to the British visa center's CCTV cameras and had a diagram of the center's computer network.

May could be toppled if 158 of her 315 lawmakers vote against her.\n\n\u2018FALLING APART\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s opposition Labour Party said the government was \u201cfalling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her cabinet, let alone parliament and the people of our country,\u201d said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior team.\n\nRaab, 44, was appointed to the role of Brexit secretary in July this year following the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May\u2019s Brexit strategy.\n\nAt the heart of Raab\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s deal was the belief that the pursuit of a customs union with the EU would be the \u201cstarting point\u201d for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, \u201cseverely prejudicing\u201d what Britain could achieve.\n\nHe said May\u2019s plan threatened the integrity of Britain and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement - to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland - where the EU had a veto over Britain\u2019s ability to exit.\n\nThe backstop arrangement to come into force if a future trade deal does not prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland has long been the main obstacle not only to a deal with the bloc, but to any agreement of her top ministers.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up May in parliament, had threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop meant the province was treated differently from the rest of mainland Britain.\n\n\u201cNo democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,\u201d Raab said in his resignation letter.\n\nEurosceptics in May\u2019s party have long feared that the prime minister was leading Britain towards a customs union with the EU, something that, they say, would mean a Brexit in name only.\n\nNigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, welcomed the resignations, praising the ministers for standing up for \u201cthe Union.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Sarah Young, Kate Holton, Guy Faulconbridge; Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Japan\u2019s New Cybersecurity Minister Admits He Doesn't Actually Use Computers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/japan-cybersecurity-minister-computer_us_5bed37c6e4b0dbb7ea6764ac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "No experience was obviously necessary for this important government job.\n\nJapan\u2019s new minister in charge of cybersecurity made a startling admission on Wednesday: he doesn\u2019t actually use computers.\n\n\u201cSince I was 25, I have been in a position of authority where secretaries and employees handle such tasks for me,\u201d Yoshitaka Sakurada, 68, told a Lower House cabinet committee meeting, per The Japan Times.\n\n\u201cI give instructions to my aide and so I don\u2019t punch into a computer myself,\u201d he added, per The Associated Press. \u201cBut I am confident our work is flawless.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Yoshitaka Sakurada may be Japan's new minister in charge of cybersecurity, but he doesn't actually use computers.\n\nMultiple media outlets noted that Sakurada, whose ministerial portfolio includes the organization of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, also appeared clueless about how USB sticks work when answering questions about the security of the country\u2019s power grid."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Camp Fire\u2019s Missing Person List Climbs To 1,011 As Statewide Death Toll Rises To 74", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/camp-fire-missing-person-list-doubles_us_5bef8a53e4b0b84243e27cd4", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "The number of names on the missing person\u2019s list for Northern California\u2019s Camp fire grew to 1,011 Friday night, nearly doubling the number reported Thursday, though fire officials warned that the list may include duplicate names.\n\nSearch-and-rescue officials also discovered eight more bodies in the Camp fire\u2019s aftermath, bringing the death total to 71.

When the Clarks became one of the first white families to move onto his nearly all-black block in the Bloomingdale neighborhood more than a decade ago, he\u2019d tried to make them feel welcome. He became friendly with the Clark brothers, who once helped him build a treehouse for his son.\n\nBut Bilal distanced himself from Jeffrey Clark and his younger brother, Edward, as they became increasingly radical, especially after one blowout fight over then-candidate Donald Trump. Then, on the night of Trump\u2019s election, Bilal\u2019s mother called to tell him about a group gathered on Clark\u2019s porch chanting about Hitler.\n\nLast summer, after someone snatched a gay pride flag off a front porch near the Clarks\u2019 home, a group of about six people ripped another pride flag off the front of the Showtime bar and a bunch of white supremacist flyers were scattered around the neighborhood, neighbors contacted Bilal, who had since moved to Maryland, and told him they suspected the Clark brothers were involved.\n\nSo Bilal went to talk to another Bloomingdale neighbor: a District of Columbia police officer. He told the cop who lived just down the street from the Clarks that neighbors were worried the brothers were involved with the racist propaganda spreading throughout the neighborhood. The police officer said he would look into it.\n\nThat was the last he heard of it.\n\nA year later, one of the brothers is dead and the other is imprisoned on gun charges after family members told the FBI that the elder Clark brother is a dangerous white supremacist. Edward Clark, 23, killed himself on Roosevelt Island in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27, hours after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. In the following days, 30-year-old Jeffrey wrote on Gab, a social media site popular among racists, that Robert Bowers, that the accused Pittsburgh shooter, was a \u201chero\u201d and that the synagogue victims \u201cdeserved\u201d to be killed. Jeffrey was arrested on Nov. 9 after his relatives turned him into the FBI.\n\nOn Friday, a federal magistrate judge ordered Jeffrey held until trial following a hearing in which a federal prosecutor described the defendant as \u201ca bomb\u201d waiting to explode.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A noose found inside the Clark home.\n\nThe death by suicide, the arrest and the public revelations about the Clark brothers\u2019 ideology have left their neighbors struggling to understand how the two men were able to spend years going to white supremacist meet-ups, making violent threats online and stockpiling guns in their home without attracting attention from law enforcement in the heart of a progressive city like Washington. Even Jeffrey Clark\u2019s public praise of the violent actions of Bowers and Cesar Sayoc, the Florida Trump supporter accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, likely would have gone unnoticed by authorities if his own family hadn\u2019t reported his behavior.\n\nIt also raises questions about law enforcement\u2019s ability to keep tabs on radicalized right-wingers who could pose a threat while they navigate First Amendment protections. Despite the Clark brothers\u2019 extensive online support for hate groups and their reputation in their Bloomingdale neighborhood, a law enforcement official confirmed that they were not on the FBI\u2019s radar until the family members raised concerns.\n\nThe Clark family moved to Washington from Utah, where both parents had attended Brigham Young University. They sent their kids to private Catholic schools. After briefly living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, the Clarks bought their house in Bloomingdale. When the parents later split up, the father stayed in the Bloomingdale house with his three children: Jeffrey, Edward and a daughter.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office Body armor and helmets found inside the Clark home.\n\nBilal, whose mother has lived in the neighborhood for decades, noticed a shift in the Clark brothers after Edward was mugged on his way to the store several years ago. The brothers shaved their heads and Jeffrey started carrying a gun.\n\n\u201cI think it really affected their manhood,\u201d Bilal said.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Bilal and Jeffrey got into arguments about Trump. Jeffrey ranted about his hatred for Mexicans, and Edward seemed to go along with it, Bilal said.\n\n\u201cI think [Jeffrey] kind of respected me in a sense where he didn\u2019t want to let me know his true nature,\u201d said Bilal, who is black. \u201cBut deep down inside, I think he hated my guts.\u201d\n\nJeffrey claimed in a podcast last year that he \u201cwas not somebody that would have been described as a racist a few years ago.\u201d He claims he went looking for answers and found it in the so-called alt-right. According to Jeffrey, the rise of the alt-right is due to people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the \u201cZionist-occupied government.\u201d\n\nOver the past year and a half, Jeffrey and Edward became regulars at white nationalist gatherings. They appeared at an April 2017 protest outside the White House organized by alt-right leader Richard Spencer to protest military airstrikes in Syria.\n\nAnd you can't spell \"aspiring mass shooter\" without \"Richard Spencer\" somewhere in there.

Posobiec denied working with the Clarks, despite appearing in several photographs where he is being filmed by the Clark brothers in Bloomingdale. Jeffrey attended a \u201cFreedom of Speech\u201d rally in D.C. in June 2017 with other alt-right members, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Around the same time, Jeffrey and Edward showed up at a D.C. bookstore to disrupt an event with Alexander Reid Ross, an author who was discussing his book Against the Fascist Creep. The Clarks were there with Jamie Troutman, a white nationalist who goes by AltRightVA online. That month, Jeffrey Traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to participate in a March Against Sharia rally organized by the Islamophobic group ACT for America, according to the Anti-Defamation League and screenshots of tweets reviewed by HuffPost.\n\nUnite the Right organizer Jason Kessler tweeted at the time, \u201cThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA,\u201d referring to pictures of the Clark brothers. Kessler wrote in an email that he does not condone politically motivated violence \u2014 but he claims it is the natural result of failing to address the grievances of white people. Suppressing that conversation, he wrote, pushes people \u201cinto an echo chamber of extremism and frustration where thoughts of violence seem like the only way out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA https://t.co/8qdzIq8VkF \u2014 Jason Kessler (@TheMadDimension) June 10, 2017\n\nThe Clark brothers also appeared at Kessler\u2019s initiation into the Proud Boys, a violent neo-fascist gang whose leader claims the group is not racist despite attracting white nationalist members.\n\nIt was around this time that the white supremacist flyers appeared in Bloomingdale and Bilal asked the local police officer to look into the Clark brothers. The D.C. police officer who lived within eyesight of the Clark home did not immediately respond to a voicemail message left with his wife. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Brianna Jordan told HuffPost in an email that she has no knowledge of the tip. She declined to say whether the police department investigated the flyers or the theft and attempted theft of the pride flags.\n\nThe Clark brothers traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to attend the deadly white nationalist rally there in August 2017.

Little was known to be in D.C. at the time, where he held a sign saying \u201cExpel the Jews\u201d outside of the White House, and the elder Clark brother had promoted Little on Gab. Little did not respond to questions about his ties to Clark. Instead, he told HuffPost he would grant an interview in exchange for a summary of a film about \u201cJewish Supremacism.\u201d\n\nBy this time, multiple neighbors suspected the Clark brothers, who were quiet and kept to themselves, of being right-wing extremists. One person who lived in the neighborhood had Googled the Clark family and found screenshots of what appeared to be Jeffrey\u2019s suspended Twitter and Facebook profiles, which included images of Jeffrey posing with a swastika, as well as descriptions of the brothers as associates of Richard Spencer. The neighbor was horrified but didn\u2019t know what to do. Despite watching for suspicious activity, the neighbor didn\u2019t find anything online or see anything in person that was illegal.\n\nHad the Clark brothers been vocal advocates of the Islamic State instead of the Third Reich, they likely would have attracted law enforcement\u2019s attention long ago. If Jeffrey was supporting a group like ISIS or al Qaeda, he could now be facing a material support charge based on his public advocacy for a group the U.S. government has labeled as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nBut there\u2019s no federal law against domestic terrorism, a fact that surprises many Americans. Consequently, federal law enforcement takes a much different approach to investigating armed neo-Nazis advocating violence than it would sympathizers of radical Islamist terrorist groups.\n\nJeffrey Clark was charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance \u2014 a rarely used criminal statute \u2014 and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-capacity ammunition magazine. The maximum prison sentence for the federal statute is 10 years and the maximum time for the D.C. offense is one year.\n\nThat means federal authorities are leaning heavily on the notion that Clark owned a gun while addicted to marijuana as the basis of his imprisonment. Marijuana is legal in Washington, although it is still an illegal substance under federal law.\n\nClark appeared in federal court in D.C. on Friday afternoon, where prosecutors argued for his continued detention because they say he poses a threat to the public and is a flight risk.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A Nazi flag found inside the Clark home.\n\nBoth David Bos, a federal public defender representing Clark, and Magistrate Judge G.

Asked by the judge if Clark\u2019s father was one of the relatives who turned him in, Cummings said he was not.\n\nBos, representing Clark, argued that Clark\u2019s \u201cdistasteful comments\u201d were \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d and suggested the government was grasping at straws to find a charge to stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a case in which the government went forward on this portion of the statute,\u201d said Bos, who has been practicing for 30 years.\n\nWhile concurring that Clark was facing an \u201cunusual charge\u201d that the judge hadn\u2019t seen before, Harvey ordered Clark detained until trial, saying he couldn\u2019t ignore Clark\u2019s \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cmenacing\u201d posts and his family members\u2019 concern that his anger \u201chas intensified\u201d in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt seemed that the defendant was preparing for something,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nBefore the hearing, federal prosecutors indicated in a filing that Clark told law enforcement he wanted to move West Virginia to nonviolently \u201ctake over\u201d a town with \u201clike-minded white nationalists.\u201d They also laid out additional evidence against the elder Clark brother, saying that authorities searching the home found a flyer from the Atomwaffen Division, a violent neo-Nazi group responsible for several murders; a rope tied into a noose above his bed; a Nazi flag and body armor; and a drawing of a gunman aiming at a caricature of a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke.\n\nNext to the anti-Semitic drawing was a bullet-pointed list of an agenda for \u201cpeaceful resolution,\u201d which included legalizing discrimination, cutting off all welfare, ending all immigration, deporting all illegal immigrants, banishing criminals to Mexico, and affirming the First and Second amendments.

A fire so devastating that hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Air so polluted that people without safety masks are trapped inside. A quarantine set up by the National Guard to limit the spread of a dangerous virus.\n\nThis is not the climactic scene of an apocalyptic horror movie, set far in the future. This is California in 2018.\n\nThe flames and smoke from the Camp fire ripping through Northern California \u2015 a record-breaking catastrophe that has claimed at least 63 lives with more than 600 people still missing \u2015 is the public health crisis that climate change researchers have been warning about.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a 55-and-older community in Paradise, California, was burned to the ground.\n\nIn Butte County, where the fire has been raging for more than a week, thousands of people have been evacuated to shelters set up in churches, high schools, fairgrounds and other sites. Many have lost their homes, loved ones and neighbors. The fire has destroyed nearly 10,000 residences so far, and over 15,000 more are threatened, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\nRight now, though, there\u2019s another acute issue preoccupying evacuees and shelter workers.\n\nMore than 140 Camp fire evacuees huddled in crowded shelters are showing norovirus symptoms, the Butte County Public Health Department announced Thursday. That number is likely much higher now.\n\n\u201cThe number of sick people is increasing every day,\u201d a release from the health department stated. \u201cTwenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support. Staff serving the shelters have also been sick.\u201d\n\nA visit to the East Avenue Church shelter in Chico shows just how quickly norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, is spreading in a community that has already suffered through so much unforeseen devastation.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty people were camped at the church on Friday when illness erupted in one corner of the shelter\u2019s multipurpose room. Evacuees overcome with sudden vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration were eventually protected by a barrier as volunteers rushed to treat them. They were feet away from their fellow evacuees, wearing air filtration masks and precautionary adult diapers, hoping not to add illness to the others\u2019 long lists of misfortunes. While volunteers bleached floors covered in feces and vomit, some evacuees took to the bushes outside the shelter to relieve themselves. These are the indignities of a catastrophe that no one plans for.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Avenue Church Shelter in Chico, California, where norovirus has spread and makeshift quarantine barriers have been erected.\n\nIt\u2019s not 100 percent certain that all patients are suffering from norovirus specifically, but the threat the infection poses justifies a prompt response. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are about 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly young children and the elderly, each year among those infected by it in the U.S.\n\nLater on Friday, the National Guard began setting up medical tents for Camp fire evacuees affected by norovirus in an attempt to better control its spread from shelter to shelter, all overcrowded with people made homeless by the fire and people who were already homeless but needed relief from the smoke. Some brought dogs and other pets.\n\nMeanwhile, counties more than a hundred miles from the fire are grappling with the health consequences of smoke that\u2019s settled around their homes.\n\nSince the Camp fire erupted on Nov. 8, the skies throughout the affected areas and spilling down into the San Francisco Bay Area have been brown and hazy. Visibility is poor. In San Francisco, the tops of buildings seem to disappear into the haze. Everywhere the air smells like fire.\n\nThat smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter measuring roughly 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5. These particulates are too small to be caught by our lungs\u2019 filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams, posing potential health risks to anyone breathing it but particularly to those with respiratory issues, as well as to older adults and children. Coughing, wheezing and other side effects have already affected many of those exposed to the abysmal air.\n\nThe Butte County Air Quality Management District reported \u201chazardous\u201d air quality in Paradise, where the fire started, and in nearby Chico, Oroville and Gridley. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AirNow site reported an Air Quality Index of 350 in Chico. For context, Delhi, India \u2015 one of the most notoriously polluted cities in the world \u2015 on Friday measured an AQI of about 240.\n\nEven the Bay Area, more than 165 miles from the epicenter of the Camp fire, is experiencing air quality conditions considered unsafe for anyone to go outside. The EPA measured an AQI of 238 in San Francisco on Friday.\n\nNorthern Californians take their good air for granted. Last year, San Francisco had 276 days with an AQI rating of \u201cgood.\u201d The average AQI in Delhi is \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Golden Gate Bridge is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires Friday.\n\nMany schools and universities throughout the Bay Area have closed in recent days due to the poor air quality. Public schools in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano and Marin counties canceled classes on Friday due to the poor air quality. The University of California, Berkeley, San Francisco State University, California State University East Bay and other colleges closed their campuses, as well. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a \u201cSpare the Air\u201d alert effective from Thursday through Tuesday that includes a ban on \u201cburning wood, including manufactured fire logs or any other solid fuel, indoors or outdoors.\u201d\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s famous cable cars were shut down on Friday.\n\nAuthorities also urged residents to stay indoors and to wear a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, marked N95 or higher, if and when they need to go outdoors.\n\nOne ACE hardware store in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district was out of masks Tuesday night but told customers a shipment of 1,000 more would be in the next morning. By Wednesday night, they were out again.\n\nThe shortage is standard across the city. Many vendors have limited customers to four masks per person. That limit has gone down to two in some places as supplies have dwindled.\n\nSmoke entering through the state\u2019s Central Valley is hovering in Bay Area counties, unable to escape through the Golden Gate, the National Weather Service explained. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of high daytime temperatures and low evening ones has triggered a phenomenon that traps the smoke close to the ground.\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS Pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District wear protective masks against the hazardous air.\n\nThe particulates in wildfire smoke also have a somewhat different chemical makeup than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources of pollution. And it comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire, which may present a different set of risks.\n\nNext to the immediate loss of life from the Camp fire, the air quality may seem a distant secondary concern. But how the poor air may affect survivors and other surrounding residents in the long term poses a frightening prospect.\n\nInhalation of PM 2.5 particles has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues. PM exposure has also been linked to increased kidney disease risk and shortened life spans of those exposed to it in the womb.\n\nHazy conditions in the Bay Area are projected to persist over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. As for now, people\u2019s hope for relief from the smoke hinges on a chance of rain that may help clean the air late next week."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Half Of Reproductive-Age Women Want Easier Access To Abortion Pills, Study Finds", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-pill-access-women_us_5bec9ea8e4b09f4670066059", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Zhang Rong via Getty Images In a new survey, nearly half of 7,000 women said they were interested in new ways to get the abortion pill.\n\nA new national survey released Thursday shows substantial support for greater access to medication abortion among women in America.\n\nCurrently, a woman who wants to take the abortion pill \u2014 actually a combination of two drugs \u2014 must go to a medical facility where she takes the first medicine, mifepristone, in front of a clinician, and the second, misoprostol, at home some hours or days later.\n\nBut in the new survey of more than 7,000 reproductive-age women, 49 percent said they supported at least one of three models for obtaining the abortion pill. Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical. The image of the coat hanger has been supplanted by the image of handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThere is research backing the safety of largely self-managed abortions, although these studies have not necessarily examined the safety of women going it entirely alone.

Sofia was one of 414 people diagnosed with a rare polio-like syndrome. Its cause continues to elude scientists. It is the latest challenge during a time when public health spending has declined.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nThe mysterious, polio-like disease that has struck 414 people \u2014 mostly young children \u2014 across the United States since 2014 comes at a time when the public health system already is overstretched.\n\nReported in 39 states and Washington, D.C., acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, causes muscle weakness and in some cases paralysis in the arms or legs, terrifying parents and puzzling medical researchers.\n\nThe disease has flared while state and federal governments largely have stopped making new investments in public health. While some infectious-disease experts think the CDC has taken too long to understand the cause of the disease, no high-profile critic has directly blamed the slow action on low public health funding.\n\nStill, many public health experts argue that the lack of investment further strains a system already stretched thin as it faces multiple challenges, including sharp upticks in sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis A and C, the opioid epidemic, seasonal flu viruses and frequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe low spending has thrown the U.S. public health system into \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research organization that promotes disease and injury prevention.\n\n\u201cInsufficient funding has hampered the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local health departments to keep pace with the new and continuing threats to the health of the American people and to fully fund prevention initiatives,\u201d the group said in a report this year on public health financing.\n\nState and local health departments must frequently shift personnel from one challenge to meet a new one, like AFM this year or the Zika virus a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen something unusual like this comes up, we don\u2019t have a pot of money to address that,\u201d said Kristen Ehresmann, Minnesota\u2019s director for infectious diseases. \u201cAnd neither does the CDC. We have to put staff on that new issue. You\u2019re constantly taking people off one thing in order to address another.\u201d\n\nCDC funding, three-fourths of which makes its way to local and state health departments, and public and private partners, in the form of grants, has lagged behind inflation since 2009 and has been almost flat since 2014. Notably, the portion of the agency\u2019s budget that goes to states for controlling infectious diseases \u00adhas also remained largely unchanged over the last four years.\n\nThe picture is similar if not worse at the state and local levels. State investment in public health funding ticked upward in the past decade only to fall below 2008 funding levels in 2015. According to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, 31 states reduced their spending on public health between fiscal 2016 and 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that since 2008, local health departments have lost 55,590 jobs through layoffs or attrition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much work, it\u2019s easy to lose focus,\u201d said Laura Power, who teaches epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cWhere do we put our effort? There\u2019s only so much money to go around.\u201d\n\nReporting Up\n\nAFM first drew attention in 2012 when the California Department of Public Health learned that a few children were suddenly afflicted with inexplicable weakness in their arms or legs. By the end of the year, 10 cases had been detected in the state.\n\nClinicians were not familiar with the disease; it was not one of the 120 illnesses that medical providers are required to report to their local or state health departments, which then report them to a disease surveillance system housed at the CDC.\n\nThose \u201cnotifiable diseases\u201d include infectious diseases such as meningitis, Legionnaires\u2019 disease and HIV, foodborne illnesses such as E. coli and non-infectious diseases, including cancer and lead poisoning. By reporting them up the chain, state and federal officials are able to see whether outbreaks are localized or widespread.\n\nBy 2014, AFM had been detected in 34 states. The CDC announced Tuesday that the number of confirmed cases for 2018 has climbed from the 72 reported last month to 90 across 27 states. The agency said it is investigating an additional 162 cases of patients with similar symptoms.\n\nAt this point, all states require health practitioners to report suspected cases.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical evidence gathered about the disease led the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a collection of public health epidemiologists working as technical advisers to the CDC, to issue a case definition of the new disease in 2015 to help clinicians across the country recognize it.\n\nEven without knowing the cause of AFM, the CDC distributed information to local and state health departments and to clinicians on how to identify a possible case and what to look for in MRI tests. The agency also tentatively suggested ways to treat infected patients \u2014 mainly by quickly starting physical and rehabilitative therapy. The CDC said that about half of patients with AFM have recovered.\n\nThe agency also issued instructions on the type of specimens it needs to help understand the cause of the disease.\n\nThe CDC has research laboratories to investigate new diseases, as does the National Institutes of Health and academic medical systems, often operating under federal grants.\n\nTo nail down a cause for AFM, officials are looking to researchers at institutions such as the University of Tennessee Medical Center, the University of Colorado and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nParents and clinicians have criticized the CDC for the time it\u2019s taken to respond to the disease. Even some of the CDC\u2019s own medical advisers have complained. \u201cFrustrated and disappointed \u2014 I think that\u2019s exactly how most of us feel,\u201d Keith Van Haren, a neurologist at Stanford University Medical Center and a CDC medical adviser told CNN earlier this month.\n\n\u2018Nothing Makes You Feel Good\u2019\n\nSome parents have also bitterly complained that the CDC hasn\u2019t reported the deaths of some children from AFM. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call with reporters Tuesday said the CDC could not specify the number of deaths linked to AFM because of a lack of follow-up investigation that it is now trying to correct.\n\nThe CDC said one person confirmed to have had AFM in 2017 died, although a spokeswoman, Kate Fowlie, said in an email, \u201cit is unclear what role AFM played in the death.\u201d She said no deaths among AFM patients have been reported to the agency this year.\n\nSince it appeared six years ago, AFM has spiked every other year, in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Many patients tested positive for an enterovirus known as D68, which was previously associated with respiratory symptoms but not weakness in the arms and legs. The link has led to a supposition that the virus may have mutated.\n\nBut the enterovirus hasn\u2019t been present in all those with AFM, prompting some scientists to investigate whether environmental or genetic factors might be playing a role. Messonnier said the CDC is now also exploring the possibility that the symptoms may be caused by an aberrant immune response to an infection rather than the infection itself.\n\nSome researchers also think that another virus might be a contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible and maybe likely that there may be other enteroviruses that are causing similar symptoms,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBy the time the symptoms appear, those infected might already have rid their bodies of the virus. Or, as Messonnier said, a pathogen may be hiding undetected in the body.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough disease,\u201d Osterholm said, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t fit a model of strict cause and effect.\u201d\n\nOsterholm isn\u2019t convinced that a retreat in public health funding has hampered progress in the case of AFM. Public health departments at all levels, he said, are used to dropping everything to meet new public health menaces when they must.\n\n\u201cPublic health just takes on more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping major efforts.\u201d He added, however, that \u201csuch a system can\u2019t go on forever.\u201d\n\nJohn Auerbach, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health, thinks insufficient funding is already consequential. While he pointed out that Congress eventually came up with additional funding to deal with outbreaks of Ebola and Zika in recent years, the money was not ongoing.\n\nWhen the money runs out, he said, experts in diseases such as Ebola and Zika, including epidemiologists and laboratory staff, often are laid off, removing the very people who could best prevent future outbreaks.\n\n\u201cWe know when permanent personnel are well trained in preparedness, they are able to anticipate a risk and take action before a crisis occurs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there aren\u2019t enough personnel, then you end up only being able to respond to an emergency, rather than prevent its appearance or reduce its impact.\u201d\n\nAs it is, he said, many health agencies can\u2019t do an adequate job to increase the rate of vaccinations or to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, both of which would contribute greatly to reducing diseases, such as Zika and perhaps AFM, in the country, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery health department would say, \u2018Yes, we could do more, but only if we had the resources,\u2019\u201d Auerbach said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cI\u2019ve said many times before that we were too slow to spot Russian interference and we certainly stumbled along the way,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a press conference, \u201cbut to suggest we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth or wanted to hide what we knew or wanted to prevent investigations is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nThe platform also issued a separate statement on its blog Wednesday, announcing that it had severed ties with Definers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2015 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "C.I.A.

It was made in a recently unsealed filing in an apparently unrelated sex-crimes case charging a man named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi with coercing and enticing an underage person to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Mr. Kokayi was charged in early August, and on Aug. 22, prosecutors filed a three-page document laying out boilerplate arguments for why his case at that time needed to remain sealed.\n\nWhile the filing started out referencing Mr. Kokayi, federal prosecutors abruptly switched on its second page to discussing the fact that someone named \u201cAssange\u201d had been secretly charged, and went on to make clear that this person was the subject of significant publicity, lived abroad and would need to be extradited \u2014 suggesting that prosecutors had inadvertently pasted text from a similar court filing into the wrong document and then filed it.\n\n\u201cAnother procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey added, \u201cThe complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has been studying how to charge Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks with some kind of criminal offense since the site began publishing its trove of secret military and diplomatic documents. Prosecutors, for example, toyed with the idea of charging Mr. Assange as a conspirator in Ms. Manning\u2019s crime of unauthorized disclosure of secrets related to national defense. And it eventually became public that a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia was investigating people with links to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut even as the Obama administration brought criminal charges in an unprecedented number of leak-related cases, it apparently held back from charging Mr. Assange. Members of the Obama legal policy team from that era have said that they did not want to establish a precedent that could chill investigative reporting about national security matters by treating it as a crime."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Julian Assange Charge Raises Fears About Press Freedom", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/julian-assange-indictment.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-17 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The disclosure that federal prosecutors have brought an unidentified criminal charge against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, follows years of government deliberations over the dilemma raised by competing desires to put him out of business and fears that doing so could create a precedent that would undermine press freedoms.\n\nMany crucial details about what prosecutors have done remain unclear, including when the criminal complaint was filed, what specific charge or charges it contains, and what facts it is based upon.

Users inhale and exhale the vapor. The devices come in numerous shapes, including ones that look like pens, flash drives and hookahs. Many consumers are confused about the health implications of e-cigarettes. This is a primer about what research so far shows about these devices.\n\nAre they safer than traditional cigarettes?\n\nYes. But that does not mean they are safe.\n\nE-cigarettes contain far fewer dangerous chemicals than those released in burning tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes typically contain 7,000 chemicals, including nearly 70 known to be carcinogenic. E-cigarettes also don\u2019t release tar, the tobacco residue that damages lungs but also contributes to the flavor of tobacco products. In the United States, cigarettes are associated with 480,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease, stroke and numerous cancers, among other illnesses.\n\nThe research on e-cigarettes is young because the products have only been around for a little over a decade. Exacerbated by the voltage of a given device, certain e-cigarette flavors can irritate the airways, researchers say: benzaldehyde (added to cherry flavored liquids), cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon flavor), and diacetyl (a buttery flavor that can cause lung tissue damage called \u201cpopcorn lung.\u201d) Some flavors become irritants when added to vaping liquids. The process of turning liquid chemicals into vapor releases harmful particulates deep into the lungs and atmosphere, including heavy metals."}]
