The 47-year-old walked out the door of his basement apartment a month ago and never came back.\n\nThe story of Samuel Oliver-Bruno and the church that tried to protect him made national news.\n\nVideos of his arrest at an immigration office went viral. So did the images of religious leaders, church members and supporters locking arms as they surrounded an ICE van in a standoff that lasted hours.\n\nBut there was another circle of people you didn't see that day.\n\nThey were inside other churches just miles away, glued to their phones and laptops, filled with a growing sense of dread.\n\nThey panicked as they watched live video of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents handcuffing their friend and taking him into custody.\n\nThey grieved when they learned he'd been deported to Mexico less than a week later.\n\nAnd they faced a harrowing question that's still haunting them as they prepare to spend another Christmas inside churches they're afraid to leave:\n\nWill I be next?\n\n\"We are in the same situation,\" says Juana Tobar Ortega, who's been living in a North Carolina church for nearly 19 months. \"And we see that things are getting worse.\"\n\nA community shaken\n\nOne by one, the announcements of immigrants taking shelter in churches fell like dominoes across the country after President Trump took office.\n\nHis administration's crackdowns triggered a new chapter in a movement that began in the 1980s with congregations across the US sheltering Central American immigrants facing deportation.\n\nThey are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to Nearly two years into Trump's presidency, about 50 people are living in sanctuary inside churches nationwide, according to Church World Service.They are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to its policy of not arresting anyone in \"sensitive locations\" -- schools, hospitals or houses of worship -- except in extenuating circumstances\n\nSamuel Oliver-Bruno's shoes are still inside the room where he lived at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham. ICE agents arrested him when he went to an appointment at an immigration office, then deported him to Mexico.\n\nWhile only a sliver of churches have joined the sanctuary movement, advocates say it's growing -- and North Carolina has been fertile ground.\n\nChurches in some of the state's more liberal-leaning cities led the way. Two churches in Greensboro first opened their doors. Then congregations in the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill followed suit.\n\nFor much of this year, according to one nonprofit , North Carolina was the state with the largest number of churches hosting immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nCityWell United Methodist Church in Durham was among them. That's where Samuel Oliver-Bruno took sanctuary. His sudden arrest at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office, where he'd been asked to give fingerprints as part of his application for deferred action, left a shaken community searching for answers.\n\nICE says agents arrested Samuel as part of a \"targeted enforcement action.\" He'd used a fraudulent Texas birth certificate when he entered the United States in 2014. And his case had been subject to extensive appeals since then, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said.\n\nICE has maintained that Samuel's detention and deportation were \"in full accordance with federal law and agency policy.\" Any foreign national who's in the United States illegally is subject to arrest and removal, the agency says, no matter how long they've been living in a so-called sensitive location.\n\n\"Mr. Oliver-Bruno is a convicted criminal who has received all appropriate legal process under federal law, has no outstanding appeals and has no legal basis to remain in the US,\" Cox said.\n\nBut Samuel's supporters describe him as a devoted father and husband who'd lived in North Carolina with his family for much of the last two decades. He'd been seeking a humanitarian waiver to stay in the United States to support his wife, who suffers from lupus and other serious illnesses.\n\nAuthorities deported him this month.\n\nAnd it's not just immigrants in sanctuary who are reeling as a result. So are the churches that took them in.\n\nA seamstress mourns for her friend -- and an uncertain future\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega smiles as soon as she hears the knock on the door.\n\nShe's been preparing for this moment for hours. It will be a welcome respite after weeks of grief. Ever since Samuel's arrest, she's struggled to stop crying.\n\nIt's time for the posada, a traditional Latin American singing ritual re-enacting Joseph and Mary's search for shelter the night Jesus was born -- with half the group playing the role of the innkeeper, and the other half playing the role of pilgrims looking for a place to stay.\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega and several family members look on as the Rev. Audra Abt preaches at a holiday service. \"I want to thank you, Juana, for your faith and for your strength on this very difficult journey,\" the pastor said.\n\nJuana and her family are the innkeepers this year. They open the door, and at first sing lyrics spurning the uninvited guests.\n\n\"This is not an inn. I don't take in strangers. You might be a robber. I can't risk that danger.\"\n\nThe symbolism isn't lost on Juana or members of the church where she's been living for nearly 19 months. Juana was the first immigrant to seek sanctuary in a North Carolina church after Trump's election. She began living at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro on May 31, 2017 , decades after she first came to the United States from Guatemala seeking asylum.\n\nJuana lost her asylum case, but she'd been checking in regularly with ICE since 2011. Each year, officials renewed a stay on her removal order, allowing her to remain in the country. That changed after Trump took office. When she went to her check-in that year, officials outfitted her with an ankle monitor and said she had just a few weeks to leave the country.\n\nJuana decided seeking sanctuary was her only option. Saint Barnabas opened its doors and welcomed her.\n\nJust like Juana does at the end of today's song:\n\n\"Enter, enter, holy pilgrims, holy pilgrims. Welcome to my humble home. Though it's little I can offer, I can offer, all I have, please call your own.\"\n\nChristine Merriman loved seeing Juana at the door, letting visitors in.\n\nA church member who's spent hours by Juana's side as part of a rotation of volunteers who stay with her, Merriman says only one thing was missing.\n\n\"We should have built a border wall out of cardboard blocks,\" she says, \"then knocked it down.\"\n\nJuana laughs.\n\n\"Maybe next year we can,\" she says.\n\nThen she pauses.\n\nThis is her second Christmas in sanctuary. She hopes she won't be here for a third.\n\nBut she's afraid she will.\n\nShe never thought she'd be here this long. The 46-year-old seamstress lives in a narrow room with concrete walls covered with artwork her grandchildren covered in words of encouragement:\n\n\"USA is a free country.\"\n\n\"We know your not leaving.\"\n\n\"If unicorns love each other, we all love each other.\"\n\nAmid festive preparations for a celebration just days before Christmas, Samuel's recent deportation comes up and the mood turns somber. \"We didn't expect such bad news,\" Juana says as her granddaughter Koral Bridguett leans in to comfort her.\n\nSewing and art projects help Juana pass the time. Her four children, two grandchildren and other family members often visit on weekends. But when they're gone, depression sinks in.\n\nAnd in the last few weeks, she says, grief has overwhelmed her.\n\nShe spoke with Samuel on a weekly conference call for people in sanctuary. She'd heard how excited he was about moving forward with his case. He told the group he was doing it for all of them, not just for himself.\n\nHis arrest was a chilling reminder of a reality she'd hoped was changing.\n\n\"There is no mercy at all for us,\" she says.\n\nFor Juana, seeing how many people supported Samuel was the only blessing. It helped her remember she's not alone.\n\nA pastor waits in sanctuary, praying for a way out\n\nJos\u00e9 Chicas flips open his laptop, logs into Facebook and gets ready to hit record.\n\nIt's almost 4 a.m. -- time for the daily prayer he broadcasts to the world.\n\nBehind him, newspaper articles on the wall tell the story of a preacher who's been separated from his flock.\n\n\"Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandonado en santuario,\" one headline reads. Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandoned in sanctuary.\n\nBuoyed by support from the Rev. William Barber, Jos\u00e9 Chicas took sanctuary in the School for Conversion, on the grounds of a Durham Baptist church, in June 2017.\n\n\"That church can be your sanctuary until it is worked out in the courts,\" Barber told a rally last year . \"Let them come into the house of God and try to seize a child of God!\"\n\nIn a strip mall storefront some 30 minutes away, Jos\u00e9's wife is trying to keep their evangelical church afloat on top of her job on the cleaning crew at a local university. But the congregation's ranks have thinned. Some didn't like the idea of a woman preaching. Others felt Jos\u00e9's case was taking too long.\n\nSo now, Pastor Jos\u00e9 prays online in live videos shared with anyone who will listen.\n\nHe sways in his seat and taps his foot on the floor as he asks God for help -- for marriages that are suffering, for people who haven't found Jesus yet, for those who have strayed.\n\nJos\u00e9 believes in redemption. Using drugs and alcohol put him on a dangerous path, he says -- one that led to a conviction for DUI and domestic abuse. But those days, he says, are long ago. He draws on them to shape his sermons but says he's a changed man.\n\n\"I was lost. I will never forget that day, February 28, 2002. I changed my life,\" he says in this morning's prayer.\n\nHis voice crescendos with each sentence. This is a story he never tires of telling.\n\n\"I never touched a beer or a cigarette again,\" he says, \"because Christ changes man.\"\n\nHe misses preaching from the pulpit. Tomorrow dozens of people from his Raleigh congregation will visit for a Christmas dinner. He's been counting the days. He has gifts for all of them wrapped in his room.\n\nThis morning, the screen says only one person is watching. But Jos\u00e9 knows with each passing minute, his online flock will grow.\n\nHe prays for his 11-year-old son, who's been suffering from a stomachache and struggling in school. He prays for members of his church and for people who've posted on his Facebook wall asking for help. He prays for migrant caravans, for the Venezuelan people, for people facing violence in his native El Salvador. He prays for his neighbors and the city that's supporting him.\n\nBut those aren't the only people on his mind.\n\nAn evangelical pastor, Jos\u00e9 begins every day with a 4 a.m. prayer that he broadcasts live on Facebook.\n\nHe also prays for Samuel, whose photo still hangs on the wall in the next room, beside pictures of other immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nActivists once had dubbed them the \" NC Sanctuary 6 .\" They became the \"NC Sanctuary 5\" after a court let one of them leave the church where he'd been living.\n\nAnd now there are four.\n\nJos\u00e9 applied for the same humanitarian protection as Samuel. He doesn't know why Samuel was the first to get a letter from immigration officials, asking him to come in for an appointment. Jos\u00e9 knows he could have been the one who ended up in the back of an ICE van the day after Thanksgiving. Watching video of the arrest made his heart sink.\n\n\"Make a miracle, Lord, for my brother Samuel ... have mercy. He was just deported to Mexico, blessed father.\"\n\nThe prayer doesn't end there. Jos\u00e9 also prays for the officials who deported Samuel. He knows firsthand how God's power can transform people.\n\n\"Lord, hallelujah, have mercy, touch these immigration officers. ... Touch them. Change them,\" he says. \"Blessed God, we are not criminals, father.\"\n\nHe pauses to wipe away tears welling up in his eyes, then keeps praying.\n\nSanctuary's somber side\n\nFor immigrants living in churches, the public side to sanctuary is only part of the picture.\n\nYes, beautiful friendships are formed between people who never realized how much they had in common. And new groups of advocates step up to take a stand.\n\nBut after the fanfare of the first few days, the press conference, the push for community support, there is another side to sanctuary-- a painful reality made even more acute by Samuel's arrest.\n\nOn a bulletin board at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro, church members and Juana's family have posted reasons why they're grateful.\n\nThe Monday mornings alone when loved ones have left and pews are empty.\n\nThe sleepless nights and the crushing desire to stay in bed.\n\nThe lack of privacy and the fear of being alone.\n\nThe buoyancy of feeling embraced by strangers and the devastation of feeling abandoned by friends.\n\nThe constant search for a way out. The fear it may never come.\n\nFacing questions he doesn't know how to answer\n\nWith his children by his side, Eliseo Jimenez joins his church in prayer.\n\n\"Every month we need healing,\" the congregation says in unison, \"but December can be the hardest time of year.\"\n\nThis will be Eliseo's second Christmas in sanctuary.\n\nHe's been living here almost 15 months.\n\nBeing separated from his children each week is devastating. There's a white board on the wall of his bedroom where his kids -- 6-year-old Allison and 5-year-old Christopher -- like to doodle when they come to visit.\n\n\"I love you dad,\" Allison wrote.\n\n\"Me too,\" Eliseo replied.\n\nEliseo Jimenez and his 5-year-old son Christopher watch a worship service at Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh. Jimenez, 40, has been living in the church since October 2017.\n\nBut being with his kids is hard, too. Allison asks questions he's not sure how to answer. Why can't he go to the park to play with them? Why doesn't he go home with them on Sunday nights? Eliseo tries to change the subject. He doesn't want to ruin their childhood.\n\nWhen they visit, they spend most of their time playing inside. Eliseo's skittish being outdoors, even in the church parking lot.\n\n\"I have to be on the lookout for any strange car or any person,\" he says. \"It's always the fear to go outside and be distracted playing with the kids, and there might be somebody.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico has lived most of his life in the United States. He was deported once in 2007. And since October 2017, he's been living here, in Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh, to try to keep that from happening again.\n\nSamuel's picture is on a bulletin board near the room where Eliseo sleeps. About a year ago, Samuel visited Eliseo, asking for advice before going into sanctuary.\n\nFind something to do around your church, Eliseo told him, \"fixing, cleaning or helping anybody possible with anything.\"\n\nThat, Eliseo says, is what's kept him sane.\n\nToday, as he sits in the church's second row, Eliseo looks with pride at something he built that's on display behind the pulpit -- a miniature replica of the stable where Jesus was born.\n\nThe children's director mentions it as she calls kids to the front of the room for their portion of the Sunday service.\n\n\"During this season we like to talk about hope and peace,\" Peg Arcari says. \"We can talk about spreading joy. If somebody says they need help, we should share and be kind to one another.\"\n\nAs the children circle around her, Arcari points to Eliseo's work.\n\n\"By creating this stable,\" she says, \"Allison and Christopher's dad spread some joy.\"\n\nEliseo tries to keep things as normal as possible for his kids when they come to visit. But they've started to ask questions he doesn't know how to answer, like why he can't play in the park or go with them out to dinner.\n\nBeing stuck in here over the holidays is difficult. But Eliseo says he's lived through worse.\n\nSeveral years ago, he spent Christmas inside the Stewart Detention Center in South Georgia, the largest immigrant detention center in the Southeast . Authorities threatened to deport him that week. They put him on a bus and said they were sending him back to Mexico.\n\nThe only way he could convince someone to listen to him was by smashing his head so hard into a seat that he started bleeding. Then they double checked his files and discovered that an attorney had submitted a new petition for him to stay in the country.\n\nEliseo was released from custody that day. He says an official told him as long as he stayed out of trouble and kept checking in with ICE, he'd be in the clear. But Eliseo says that changed for him and so many others after Trump took office. They suddenly found their work permits weren't being renewed and long-delayed deportation orders were taking effect.\n\nSince the day he left Stewart, he hasn't been able to shake the feeling of constant fear. No matter what happens with his case, he doesn't think he ever will.\n\nHaunting nightmares\n\nThe glow of holiday lights reflects on Rosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz's face as she sits beside a small Christmas tree.\n\nIn a matter of days, her children will be visiting, but she doesn't feel much like celebrating.\n\nShe feels trapped inside the room where she's living. Last night she couldn't sleep. She's been crying all morning.\n\nSince she entered sanctuary at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill in April, Rosa has regularly spoken with her children on the phone. Their photos hang on the wall in the converted office that's become her bedroom. \"I love my babies,\" one picture says. But visits can be heartbreaking. It crushes her every time her children walk out the door.\n\nAn immigration court in Charlotte has ordered her deportation. But Rosa is appealing. She never expected the wait for an answer would take so long.\n\nShe jumps every time her phone rings, hoping her attorney is calling with news.\n\nAnd since Samuel's arrest, she's felt even more on edge. She's afraid to talk on the phone about her case -- and afraid of what will happen next.\n\n\"There's a heightened level of fear,\" says the Rev. Isaac Villegas of Chapel Hill Mennonite Fellowship, which rents space at Church of Reconciliation and is co-hosting Rosa in sanctuary. \"We have someone at the church 24 hours a day just to make Rosa feel safer and to keep her safe.\"\n\nRosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz chats with volunteer Libby Johnson as she makes pupusas at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill. The two women have become close friends since Rosa began living at the church in April.\n\nRosa is terrified to return to Honduras, a country she fled after her partner stabbed her. She says he's threatened to kill her if she ever returns.\n\nWhen she does manage to sleep, a recurring nightmare haunts her. Night after night, she dreams immigration agents are chasing her.\n\nSometimes she wishes she would fall asleep and not wake up. Then, she says, the real-life nightmare she's living would end.\n\nAs Rosa tears up, Libby Johnson offers a hug.\n\nRosa smiles. The warm embrace, and the love she's received from Libby and so many others at the church, have given her strength in her darkest hours.\n\nShe's grateful God put so many good people in her path.\n\nThe day Samuel was detained, Libby was one of 27 supporters who were arrested.\n\nAs she rushed to the immigration office that day, she thought of the many hours she'd spent with Rosa, and how important it is to stand up for others and live the morals the church teaches.\n\n\"It's a call,\" she says. \"If you really want to walk your talk, then you need to take risk.\"\n\nTaking a risk to help undocumented immigrants seems to be something more churches in the area are interested in doing after Samuel's arrest, Villegas says. Several new congregations have come forward to say they want to host someone in sanctuary.\n\nHe tells anyone who's interested that they need to be prepared to stick it out for the long haul.\n\n\"This could be multiple years,\" he says, \"because Trump won't change anything.\"\n\nThe hole he left behind\n\nSamuel's room at CityWell is empty, but it's full of reminders of the life that was lived here and the man who is missing.\n\nWedding photos are taped to the armoire door. Notes he took during a Duke Divinity School class are sitting on a nearby table. So is a stack of books he'd been studying. \"Aprenda Ingl\u00e9s para Conversar\" -- Learn English for Conversation -- is at the top.\n\nA sign on the door still says, \"Oliver Family's Home.\"\n\nThe room is still and quiet, but the church's pastor still hears Samuel's voice every time he walks by.\n\nThe music minister thinks of him when he passes by the prayer room across the hall that Samuel -- who'd worked for years as a drywall contractor -- helped build.\n\nUpstairs in the worship hall, someone taped a sign to the wooden chair where Samuel used to sit during services.\n\n\"Samuel's seat,\" it says. \"Keep praying.\"\n\nA sign marks the chair where Samuel Oliver-Bruno used to sit during services at CityWell United Methodist Church. The Rev. Cleve May says his congregation is grieving, but not giving up. \"The story of God in this world is God showing up in the midst of injustice and oppression,\" he says.\n\nThe Sunday after his deportation, Samuel sent the church a video message from Mexico. It was broadcast on TV screens during services.\n\n\"Even though I am in my country, I feel afraid,\" he said. But he added that the North Carolina congregation was still giving him strength.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, I love you all a lot. You will always be with me. Everywhere I go I will talk about all of you, about how much love and support you gave my family.\"\n\nSince Samuel's arrest, CityWell pastor the Rev. Cleve May says he and others have been wrestling with tough questions about the sanctuary movement's future.\n\n\"One of the gambles the sanctuary movement makes is that ICE really doesn't want to kick the hornet's nest of people with privilege,\" May says. \"If you traumatize their church, they're going to throw a real stink. The publicity of this is a deterrent to ICE.\n\n\"It has been thought that the public exposure of sanctuary would serve as a prophylactic to ICE aggression, that surely they wouldn't come somewhere where the light is really bright. I'm not sure we can bank on that anymore.\"\n\nHe sees Samuel's arrest as a violation of sanctuary.\n\nThose who went with Samuel to his appointment were praying and singing religious songs outside the immigration office.\n\n\"For us it was a statement that sanctuary is not a building,\" he says. \"It was people saying to a person, 'You belong with us and we stand with you.'\"\n\nCelebrating the holidays without Samuel is difficult, May says, but darkness and joy can coexist. Grieving the loss has become part of the church's identity.\n\n\"The presence of God doesn't erase the presence of pain,\" he says.\n\nAnd nothing will erase the many ways Samuel shaped the church and his friends there.\n\nIn worship, he says, they're still singing songs Samuel taught them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Congolese boy who traveled to US to have facial tumor removed dies", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/6Li27biqjk0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Congolese boy who traveled to the United States to have a tumor removed from his face died Friday, the organization who sponsored him said in a statement.\n\nThe Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, created by the former NBA player, said in a statement on Instagram on Saturday that Matadi Sela Petit, 8, died after suffering a rare genetic reaction to anesthesia during surgery.\n\n\"Despite the diligent efforts of his medical caregivers, Matadi did not recover and he passed away last night,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Mutombo Foundation sponsored Matadi's trip to the United States.

Lying to a licensed gun dealer is a felony punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.\n\nBreaking that law might seem risky. But in September, a Government Accountability Office study made it clear why those who \"lie and try\" would take their chances. Regional offices at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives received 12,710 cases of firearm background check denials for further investigation in fiscal year 2017, the GAO found, but the government prosecuted only 12 people. More than 99.9% of those who were investigated escaped with nothing more than a warning.\n\nPast and present ATF agents and prosecutors told CNN that, given limited resources, they're not inclined to prioritize the nonviolent crime of lying on a form over more serious charges, like gun trafficking. The very few \"lie and try\" cases they prosecute focus on dangerous \"trigger pullers\" who clearly know they're prohibited from owning a firearm -- career criminals with a history of violence or activity in the drug trade.\n\nBut a 2006 internal ATF briefing paper obtained by CNN suggests that gun form liars are far more likely to go on to commit a gun crime than even many experts recognize. When ATF analyzed firearm denial cases sent to field offices for investigation during a seven-year period, it found that 10%-21% of that group went on to be arrested for a crime involving guns.\n\nTake John Zawahri, who tried to buy a gun at a California dealer in 2011. State investigators spotted at least one disqualifier -- he had been held at the UCLA hospital psychiatric ward as a violence-prone teen. The California Department of Justice denied him the purchase.\n\nLike almost all gun-form liars, Zawahri was not prosecuted. Undeterred, he built his own semi-automatic rifle mostly from mail-order parts and, two years later, went on a rampage. On June 7, 2013, he set his home on fire, executed his father and older brother with shots to the chest, then hijacked a car to Santa Monica College and killed three others. Dozens of students and bystanders managed to survive by hiding behind restaurant tables and library doors. Police officers caught up to Zawahri at the college library, where they shot him 25 times in a gun battle.\n\nWould prosecution for having lied on a gun form have stopped Zawahri from building his own gun and going on to use it? \"I don't believe it would make a difference. There would have been some short jail term, or probation, and he still would have accumulated the gun parts in the two years after that,\" Santa Monica Homicide Detective Chad Goodwin told CNN.\n\nBut a surprising range of authorities have argued that enforcing \"lie and try\" could make a difference -- including not only anti-gun groups and criminal justice academics, but also former law enforcement officers, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration, and even the National Rifle Association. By failing to bring charges in cases like Zawahri's, the government is leaving thousands of lawbreakers without any new blemish to their names.\n\nLike almost all Americans who lie on federal gun forms, John Zawahri was not prosecuted. He was one of many gun form liars who go on to commit crimes with a gun.\n\nThat reduces the law's function as a deterrent to prohibited possessors who might hope to get lucky with the federal background check system. It also allows gun form liars to fly under the radar for law enforcement -- and to avoid being assigned a probation officer who would monitor them to make sure they didn't obtain a weapon. And, in the event of a later crime, it leaves what could have been a significant previous charge -- which might typically lead to more prison time -- off their records.\n\nDavid Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that prosecutors and law enforcement officials should rid themselves of the idea that lying on gun forms is a crime not worth pursuing. \"It's worthwhile to go after these cases. The prosecution in question here is failing to fill out a form accurately. That doesn't seem like a big deal. But prosecution is a means to an end -- getting dangerous people off the street.\"\n\nIn Zawahri's case, failure to prosecute probably meant that the young man's years-long obsession with guns and violence stayed below the notice of investigators. Instead, his name merely became one of thousands sitting on law enforcement lists of those who have tried to purchase guns illegally and failed.\n\nA low priority for overburdened agents\n\nWhen you try to buy a firearm at a licensed dealer, you must fill out a federal form that asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using any illegal drugs, subject to a restraining order, or inside the United States illegally. It also asks if you've previously been convicted of a felony or domestic violence, adjudicated \"as a mental defective,\" dishonorably discharged from the military, or if you've ever renounced US citizenship.\n\nIf you're prohibited and answer truthfully, a gun dealer is supposed to scrap the sale. If you lie, a subsequent background check conducted by law enforcement is supposed to find any disqualifiers in your record. Twenty-nine states and Washington DC rely on the FBI for all firearm sale background checks, 13 states do their own, and 8 split the work. Then the cases are referred to law enforcement: It's up to ATF to investigate federal background check denials, while local police handle state-level denials. After the law enforcement agents investigate, they present potential cases to local or federal prosecutors, who ultimately decide whether to charge someone with a crime.\n\nThe federal gun form asks if you're currently under indictment, a fugitive from justice, using illegal drugs, or inside the United States illegally, among other things.\n\nThe federal form, and the penalty for false statements on it, is there to discourage prohibited possessors from trying to buy guns in the first place. But a person only breaks the law if a prosecutor can show they \"knowingly\" made a false statement. That can be difficult to prove. Some people who approach a gun shop counter might legitimately forget about a decades-old domestic violence conviction or a felony they committed as a teen, current and former ATF agents said.\n\nStill, even for someone who is perfectly aware they're a prohibited possessor, it can be worth trying to buy a gun, because so few cases meet US attorneys' standards for potential criminal prosecution. The federal background check system blocked 112,090 attempts to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017. About a tenth of them were referred to ATF field offices for further investigation.\n\nEven when ATF agents do discover a potential gun buyer committed a crime, US attorneys usually don't have the appetite to take on these cases. According to the recent GAO report, federal prosecutors rarely pursue criminal charges, due to a perception that trying these cases in court \"may offer little value to public safety because the offender does not obtain the firearm.\"\n\nStates that handle these cases are also reluctant to divert troopers or local police away from their regular duties to look into this crime. When the GAO surveyed the 13 states that do their own background checks for all gun purchases, it found that 10 of them don't even investigate these denials, \"citing competing resource demands\" and a lack of laws on the books. The only states that investigated gun purchase denials were Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- and cases in those states had a high bar.\n\n\"We were surprised about the challenges,\" said Gretta Goodwin, who oversaw the study as GAO director of homeland security and justice issues. \"States were pretty clear with us that doing these investigations could be disruptive. They were taking state troopers off the road. They were having to make these kinds of sacrifices or tradeoffs.\"\n\nTo some criminal justice experts, the shortage of law enforcement resources to crack down on illegal attempted purchases of firearms is a symptom of a larger problem: We live in a country with more guns than we can afford to track. The sheer number of guns in civilian hands, they say -- 393 million, by one count -- fuel this problem in a way that will always outpace police efforts.\n\n\"This resource strain is a function of the system we have in place. There's a huge social cost for having a Second Amendment and relatively lax gun laws,\" said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nA stunning internal report\n\nIn an interview, former ATF special agent in charge David Chipman confirmed that he commissioned the 2006 internal report. He had been \"absolutely stunned\" by the results, he said.\n\n\"The assumption was these people weren't a threat,\" Chipman told CNN. He is now a senior policy adviser at the pro-gun control group Giffords.\n\nThe headquarters of ATF in Washington, DC. Internal research there found that a significant percentage of those left unprosecuted for the felony of lying on a gun form will go on to commit a gun crime.\n\nThe 30-page internal study explored how, despite an order from then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to crack down on \"those who attempt to purchase guns illegally,\" ATF agents rarely presented cases to prosecutors -- even if the cases met these attorneys' stringent guidelines. The study also highlighted the surprising importance of these cases by taking a closer look at some of the 82,047 cases ATF sent to its field offices for investigation from late 1998 until early 2006. Out of a random sample of 202 cases, 30 of them showed a \"subsequent arrest history (that) appeared to involve a firearm\" during the seven-year review period. Based on that, the report concluded that an estimated 10%-21% of people denied gun purchases -- whose cases made their way to ATF field offices -- committed \"subsequent crimes (that) involved firearms\" during the span of the study.\n\nIf the decade-old study's findings hold up, it suggests that anywhere from 1,322 to 2,631 of the 12,710 people who attempted to buy a gun in fiscal year 2017, failed a background check, and had their cases sent to ATF field offices, would eventually get a gun and commit a crime. Two criminal policy academics who reviewed the ATF paper at CNN's request said they were confident in the research paper's methodology and conclusions, and they think the rate of subsequent gun crimes by attempted purchasers would likely be the same or higher today.\n\nChipman thinks the problem may have gotten worse. Since 2006, online exchanges that connect buyers and sellers have changed the marketplace, making it easier than ever for a prohibited person to find a private seller and avoid a background check when buying a firearm. Federal law requires licensed gun shops to conduct background checks, but not private sellers.\n\nAnd states have a difficult time cracking down on a burgeoning phenomenon: mail-order gun parts and do-it-yourself \"ghost gun\" kits, like the ones that allowed Zawahri to construct his own firearm in California. Webster, the Johns Hopkins professor, noted that private gun ownership in general has significantly increased, flooding the market with weapons that criminals may obtain through theft or undocumented sales.\n\nSince the 2006 study, ATF has not assessed the threat from people who lie on gun background check forms, the agency told CNN. And the original paper remained unknown to the public, as is typical for such internal briefing papers. Asked why it was not released, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell told CNN: \"The draft report to which you refer is now 12 years old. I do not know why it was not finalized/released ... & obviously the individuals who were working then are long gone.\"\n\nChipman, who commissioned the briefing paper, said that the report was final and not a draft. \"The biggest frustration I ever had working at ATF is that some of this high-level data about what happens after people are denied\" never reaches the public, he said.\n\n\"It really is something the people need to know,\" he said. \"Facts matter. There's science and data. And that data should be out there ... it solidifies what the real challenges are so that policymakers have a shared group of facts.\"\n\nNew interest in lie-and-try; but so far, little change\n\nThe GAO investigator who recently reviewed prosecution of \"lie and try\" cases told CNN she was surprised to learn about the internal ATF statistics on subsequent crimes committed by people who provide false information on gun buying forms. The GAO was not aware of the briefing paper, GAO's Goodwin told CNN. Even without that information, however, the GAO acknowledged that a major crackdown would require more resources for law enforcement.\n\nThe GAO found that ATF agents sometimes simply send denied purchasers a text message or letter to deter future attempts -- and potentially serve as future evidence that the person knew they were prohibited. ATF officials told GAO they prefer text messages over official-looking warning letters because text messages \"are less intimidating to prohibited persons, the texts save time and money, and are more effective in helping retrieve firearms.\"\n\nThe GAO report suggests that ATF review the benefits of using text messages and warning letters \"as an enforcement tool,\" and perhaps consider making this an agency-wide policy. An ATF spokesman said there's no rigid policy at the agency for making contact with those who lie and try. Less serious cases, like those involving someone with a decades-old felony who tried to buy what's considered a turkey-hunting shotgun, result in a simple courtesy phone call to inform a rejected gun buyer why they were denied. More serious cases, like those involving domestic abusers who try to buy a handgun shortly after conviction, might result in a formal warning letter by mail or even a knock on the door.\n\nIn a country that has become increasingly polarized into Second Amendment rights and gun control camps, lie-and-try enforcement could be one area of consensus. The Democratic congressman who commissioned the report, US Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of the Bronx in New York, told CNN of its release: \"This is one rare moment where we can agree on guns.\"\n\n\"The laws we have should be enforced. We don't fund these agencies properly,\" he said. \"The end result is that people are getting guns who shouldn't get guns.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of 10 senators led by US Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in March that would force the FBI to notify local law enforcement whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and fails the background check. The NICS Denial Notification Act would not provide additional funding for local police to investigate gun form lying, but it would put lawbreakers on their radar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Toomey called his bill \"a commonsense, yet critical, step Congress should take to strengthen gun safety laws.\"\n\n\"One thing that both parties agree on when it comes to gun safety is that we should enforce the laws that we already have on the books,\" US Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, a co-sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The House version of the bill is in a similar stage. A previous version of the bill, as written by US Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, failed to make it through the House in 2017.\n\nThe lobbying power that most fiercely opposes new gun laws, the National Rifle Association, told CNN it does not oppose the bill. As long as 18 years ago, the organization was calling for tougher crackdowns on prohibited possessors who attempt to buy firearms, framing the issue this way: \" prosecution is prevention .\"\n\n\"The National Rifle Association continues to support the prosecution of dangerous people who knowingly attempt to illegally purchase a firearm,\" said Lars Dalseide, an NRA spokesman.\n\nBecause the bill lacks new funding to pay for local officers to actually follow up on the additional criminal data, former ATF agents tell CNN they doubt the bill will be effective. A spokesman for Coons said the senator would be willing to support a funding provision for the bill \"if more resources are required to do the job correctly.\"\n\nIn March, former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo to step up enforcement of lying on gun forms, directing all of the country's US attorneys to \"enhance prosecution\" in each of their districts \"to ensure vigorous and appropriate prosecution of 'lie-and-try' cases.\" The memo still puts \"particular emphasis on cases against violent persons,\" such as those with previous convictions for violent felonies and misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.\n\n\"We are proud to have taken the most aggressive action to step up lie-and-try prosecutions in nearly a decade,\" a DOJ spokesman told CNN. He added that, under Sessions, the department has stepped up gun prosecutions in general, evident because it has \"charged the highest number of federal firearm defendants in history this past year.\" In fiscal year 2018, the federal government charged more than 15,300 people with firearms offenses -- 17% higher than ever before, according to the DOJ.\n\nThe attorney general's directive came as the GAO was ending its review, so the report didn't capture a possible shift on prosecutorial standards. Sessions ordered prosecutors in the nation's 94 judicial districts to meet with ATF and revise local prosecution guidelines \"as necessary.\" These guidelines are important, because they determine whether the feds in each district are willing to pursue charges -- and whether the bar could be higher, say, in Miami than in San Francisco.\n\nWhen asked by CNN, however, ATF could not point to any change in the way its agents approach these types of cases since the directive from Sessions. The agency indicated that it had \"met with all (US attorney's offices and) reviewed the guidelines.\"\n\nEven to find out what those prosecutorial standards are, and how they differ by region, is no easy task. In January, CNN filed a public records request to ATF for copies of the guidance it receives from local prosecutors about which cases to refer. ATF has not yet formally responded, but a spokesman redirected CNN to the Executive Office for the US Attorneys. CNN filed a similar request with that agency in June. It redirected CNN back to ATF.\n\nSome states have begun to recognize what a danger sign it can be for a prohibited person to skirt the law and try to buy a gun. Last year, Washington became the first state that notifies victims of domestic violence when their convicted abuser attempts to purchase a firearm. Gun dealers there must notify a state association of police and sheriffs whenever someone fails a background check, and the state's \"automated protected person notification system\" then passes on the information. Domestic violence groups in other states are taking notice.\n\n\"Too often our system turns a blind eye to how dangerous a case could be,\" said Tara Muir, policy director at the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. A prohibited person's attempt to buy a gun \"has to be one of the most dangerous indicators there is.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mystery company involved in Mueller investigation appeals to Supreme Court", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/iOdFb8WJsA0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) An unnamed, foreign government-owned company in a mystery court case is asking the Supreme Court to pause a grand jury subpoena it received related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe Supreme Court appeal comes after a federal appeals court ruling that ordered the company to comply with the subpoena, which required it to turn over \"information\" about its commercial activity in a criminal investigation.

The move provoked the resignations of his most admired Cabinet officer, Defense Secretary James Mattis, who penned a devastating critique of Trump's \"America First\" world view, and a day later, of Trump's special envoy in the ISIS fight, Brett McGurk\n\nA surprise announcement that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery for cancerous growths on her lung added to the frenetic mood in Washington, as the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Trump by knocking back his new restrictions on asylum seekers who cross the southern border.\n\nThe sense of things slipping out of control on multiple fronts left the political world more unsettled and on edge than at any other time in Trump's tumultuous presidency.\n\nEven Republicans who have rarely dared to the cross the President fumed that Trump appeared to navigate himself into a no-win situation with the government shutdown, and border wall funding prospects that will only worsen once Democrats take control of the House in a couple of weeks.\n\n\"We are pretty much flying here without an instruction book,\" said Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt.\n\nTrump, who bowed to a right-wing revolt and forced the fight by digging in on a dispute over funding for his border wall, addressed the crisis by tweeting a picture of himself signing already-passed bills -- a number of which concerned the naming of post offices -- while also complaining that he was staying in Washington instead of heading out on his 16-day Florida golf vacation as planned.\n\nThat was after one senator, Democrat Brian Schatz from Hawaii, flew all the way home to have what he tweeted was a \"17 minute visit\" with his family before hopping back on a plane to rejoin the Senate's latest round of brinksmanship.\n\n\"Wheels down IAD ready to vote no on this stupid wall,\" he tweeted when he got back.\n\nAt midnight on Friday, the government slipped into a partial shutdown after Congress declined to bow to Trump's demands for $5 billion in taxpayer cash for a border wall that he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for. While negotiations are expected to continue, the Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon, likely assuring the partial government shutdown would continue until at least Thursday, when the Senate is scheduled to reconvene.\n\n\"OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!\" Trump tweeted on Friday night along with a video in which he demanded a \"great barrier\" to stop what he said were gangs and criminals pouring across the border\n\nA White House official told CNN's Pamela Brown that while staffers are used to chaos, this time around \"it feels different.\"\n\n'Craziness' going on\n\nShock and dread hung over the four-mile power corridor between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill over the sensational resignation of Mattis, long seen as a crucial restraint on an erratic commander in chief.\n\nTrump was reported to be \"angry\" about the resignation letter. But the President's plans to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan that pushed Mattis to quit were still reverberating around the world, with Turkish officials threatening retaliation against the Kurds, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn another example of Trump's apparent desire to flex executive power, Trump is asking advisers whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell. Two people familiar with the matter described the President as furious at the Fed chief following the latest interest rate hike at a time when markets are tumbling. So far the White House has not made a final legal determination on the matter.\n\nThe story, first reported by Bloomberg, came after CNN revealed that Trump is also furious with his acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker after federal prosecutors referenced the President's actions in crimes to which his former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAmid the uproar, it went almost unnoticed that Whitaker decided to ignore a recommendation from senior Justice Department ethics officials to recuse himself from the Russia probe -- a revelation that comes after prosecutors in New York indicated Trump directed Cohen to make illicit hush money payments before the 2016 election, and as Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn is still awaiting sentencing from a judge who told Flynn he \"arguably sold your country out\" through his dealings with foreign powers.\n\nWhitaker may have been unwilling to risk the President's wrath after watching his former boss Jeff Sessions get relentlessly attacked and finally fired over his recusal in the probe. But Whitaker's decision will exacerbate fears about the exposure of special counsel Robert Mueller to presidential interference.\n\nTrump's case of humbug can hardly have been helped when the Supreme Court upheld a ban on his new asylum restrictions \u2014 with one of his recent Twitter targets, Chief Justice John Roberts, siding with the court's liberal wing to cast the deciding vote. Trump later tweeted well wishes to Ginsburg for \"a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nA grim run on Wall Street is deepening a feeling of vulnerability this holiday season.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped another 400 plus points, to enshrine its worst weekly plunge since the crisis year of 2008, while the Nasdaq retreated into a bear market in the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression.\n\nThe White House official who was in contact with CNN's Brown said that with the impending departures of both Chief of Staff John Kelly and Mattis, there is a feeling that the guardrails are coming off. The official says \"of course it's crazy. Anyone looking at this has got to think there's some craziness going on.\"\n\nThe source also said there is uncertainty among staffers about what Mick Mulvaney will do as chief of staff, adding that a lot of people inside the West Wing are looking at what has happened the last 48 hours and wondering if that is indicative of what else is to come.\n\nThe source added there's a sense that the President is not listening as much to certain advisers as much as he once did, including Kelly and Mattis. There have been several recent examples of the President making a decision only to change his mind after receiving outside influence.\n\nOne case in point: his shift over the short-term funding bill following pressure from outside conservatives like Ann Coulter.\n\n'Blindsiding the swamp'\n\nWhile everything seemed tenuous in Washington, it's not clear that an almost tangible sense of foreboding was shared across the nation.\n\nAfter all, nearly half the country voted for this. Trump's political base elected him to send the political establishment reeling and to unpick the alliance systems and international commitments that have underpinned US leadership of the Western world for Trump's entire life.\n\nThe President has anchored his White House on the unshakable support of his most loyal supporters, never bothering to reach out to other Americans to build a wider coalition.\n\nHad he been keen to broaden his support ahead of his 2020 election race, Trump might have spent the last week trading his border wall fight for a prolonged victory lap for a first step towards a criminal justice overhaul. A more normal White House would have made sure not to step on what was a significant political win.\n\nThe President signed the rare bipartisan bill on Friday in an Oval Office tableau surrounded by members of Congress who congratulated him at length for getting something done. But his celebration was quickly overshadowed by all the other raging storylines, not least his own decision to return to his demands funding for a border wall. As the government headed into a shutdown Friday, Trump tweeted designs for a border barrier made up of steel slats which he said was \"totally effective while at the same time beautiful!\"\n\nEarlier in the week, it seemed that Trump would agree to a spending bill to keep the government fully open into next year without wall funding.\n\nBut stung by a backlash by House conservatives and conservative pundits who accused him of caving in his last best chance to build the wall given the incoming House Democratic majority, he abruptly changed course.\n\n\"People are expecting, Americans are expecting, that a Republican President, along with his Republican House and Senate will have an end game,\" said Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\n\nBut Trump's cheerleaders in conservative media were delighted by his disruptive tactics.\n\n\"Donald Trump blindsided the swamp yesterday,\" said Rush Limbaugh in his show-opening monologue on Friday.\n\nLate in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared in the chamber to announce that there would be renewed efforts to forge a deal between Democrats and Republicans, the House and the Senate and the White House to avert a government shutdown. He wore on his lapel a badge featuring a reindeer and the slogan \"Senate cranky coalition.\"\n\nEven the deadpan Kentuckian couldn't resist a chuckle when he uttered the words that formally put the Senate in limbo so negotiations could take place.\n\n\"I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695.\"\n\nThe impenetrable congressional jargon only added to perceptions of that a Washington farce is unfolding this Christmas."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Partial government shutdown likely to continue until after Christmas", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/OQ0ZEGInrWA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The Senate adjourned for the day Saturday afternoon without coming to an agreement on a spending deal that would end a partial government shutdown -- likely assuring the federal closures will continue until after Christmas.\n\nThe developments come hours after members of Congress and President Donald Trump were unable to reach an agreement Friday night, resulting in the third government shutdown of the year.\n\nThere will be a pro forma Senate session on Monday, but the next actual session is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe move means members can travel home for Christmas and not worry about being called back to vote until a deal could be reached, but GOP leaders told senators that if there was no deal by Thursday, they would not have to return for that session, sources tell CNN.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday evening that he would remain in Washington for the Christmas holiday, writing on Twitter, \"I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House! #MAGA.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Saturday that first lady Melania Trump would return from their Mar-a-Lago resort, where she and the President had planned to spend the holiday.\n\n\"Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,\" Sanders said.\n\nIn the unlikely event a deal is reached by Monday, the pro forma session could be used to pass it by unanimous consent or voice vote, something that would only require one senator to be in attendance.\n\n\"If an agreement is reached, we'll come back and pass it,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters as he left the floor.\n\nVice President Mike Pence proposed spending $2.5 billion on border security, including the wall, in a stopgap spending bill during his meetings on Friday night and Saturday afternoon with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSeveral of the sources said there were policy additions and restrictions included in the proposal to try to bridge the gap.

This is the first time in 40 years that the government will have been closed three times in a year.\n\nThe funding legislation that earlier this week seemed certain to pass both chambers was thrown into limbo on Thursday when Trump told House GOP members he would not sign a bill unless it included $5 billion to fund a border wall.\n\nDespite the House of Representatives passing a bill on Thursday, which included this demand, it was clear on Friday that there was not enough support in the Senate for the bill, including the $5 billion for the wall, to clear.\n\nFriday night, a path forward appeared ambiguous, as all sides seemed stagnant in their demands days before the Christmas holiday, when Congress was expected to be out of session.\n\nRepublican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who was briefed by Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney on Friday, told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux on Saturday morning that the hope is McConnell will have a deal to announce when the Senate reconvenes at noon.\n\nThe debate between the White House and Congress focuses not just on how much money to allocate to border security, but also on the language stipulating where and how that money can be spent, he said.\n\n\"What is fencing, what is land ports of entry, what's technology, what's staffing?\" Lankford said. \"I think there's a general agreement ... that we need to do border security. Now's figuring out how much for each amount.\"\n\n\"Right now we're trying to finalize all the final text and to be able to make sure everyone's looked at it, everyone's agreed, signed off on it. ...\" he said. \"Then we'll move to a vote 24 hours from there.\"\n\nLankford also said he is \"confident\" that if Pence says the President is on board with any deal, Trump will keep to his word.\n\n\"We've agreed in the Senate we're not bringing anything to the floor until we know all three bodies have agreed to it,\" Lankford said. \"Then we can expedite it through the process on the floor.\"\n\nIf there's no an agreement, Lankford said he believes the American people will be looking at a much longer shutdown.\n\nA Senate Democratic aide said Saturday that talks continue at the staff level and confirmed that any deal will need signoff from congressional leadership and Trump before it comes to a vote. Democrats continue to push for border security options that they believe work, rather than a wall. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has insisted to Pence and Republicans that the President must sign off on that before a vote.\n\nTrump earlier on Friday predicted a shut down, but placed the blame on Democrats, saying \"it's really the Democrat shutdown, because we've done our thing.\n\n\"The chances are probably very good\" that there is a shutdown,\" Trump said Friday afternoon.\n\nHe later added: \"Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're totally prepared for a very long shutdown.\"\n\nAnd in a White House-produced video posted on Twitter two hours before the government was partially closed, Trump said, \"We're going to have a shutdown. There's nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes.\" He added, \"The shutdown hopefully will not last long.\"\n\nPelosi and Schumer threw the blame back at Trump and Republican lawmakers in a joint statement shortly after midnight, warning that if the \"Trump shutdown\" continued, House Democrats would pass a bill to re-open the government in January.\n\nWhen he appeared to be leaving on Friday night, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"constructive talks are underway.\"\n\nWhen he was asked if he would be coming back to participate in the talks, the Kentucky Republican said, \"as I've said repeatedly, we need Democratic votes and presidential signature.\"\n\nA person familiar with Pence, Kushner and Mulvaney's five-hour trip to the Capitol said they made it clear that the initial request that included just $1.6 billion for the wall wasn't going to cut it.\n\n\"There is no quick end to this,\" said one source with direct knowledge of the talks.\n\nIf a deal is to be reached, votes could happen as early as Sunday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump discusses firing Fed chairman after latest rate increase", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/HiigxcUD1jI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump has begun polling advisers about whether he has the legal authority to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, according to two people familiar with the matter, who described the President as newly furious at the Fed chief as markets tumble.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump's advisers told the President that it was doubtful he would have the law behind him if he fired Powell.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teens open up on sex to beat 'toxic' masculinity", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/QLFn9dMX3NQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On a warm Saturday afternoon, more than a dozen young men and teenage boys sit on plastic chairs in a yard in their neighborhood.\n\nThey gather to talk about women, respect -- and sex.\n\nIt's a meeting that occurs twice a week in Pankop, a small town in Mpumalanga province, in eastern South Africa.\n\nSome of these young men are virgins, and the group's head, Kabelo Chabalala, is at pains to emphasize that it is OK to be one.\n\n\"There's a lot of toxic masculinity,\" Chabalala, 27, told CNN of the stereotypes portrayed around masculine gender roles in his country.\n\nHe believes that some of this is down to many young men in South Africa growing up without good role models.\n\n\"I realized that growing up without a father figure in my life could have influenced me to make some bad decisions,\" Chabalala said. Many of these young boys \"don't have fathers that are present.\"\n\n\"We see quite a lot of femicide [killing of a woman or girl] in South Africa,\" he explained. The global rate of femicide for 2015 was 2.4 per 100,000 women. In comparison, South Africa's rate for the same year was 9.6 per 100,000 women according to a 2018 report by Statistics South Africa\n\n\"I thought that maybe if we work on how boys and men are socializing, we can have a different generation of men,\" he added. \"Instead of complaining, one could do something positive.\"\n\nYMM members discuss sex during a meeting in Pankop, Mpumalanga province, in South Africa.\n\nIn 2015, Chabalala launched the Young Men Movement, a nonprofit support group creating safe spaces for men to talk about their feelings.\n\nMembers participate in open discussions designed to restore \"a safe environment for women,\" he says. This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report. That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year.

Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product.

That breaks down to a larger deficit of \u00a395bn for goods, but a surplus of \u00a328bn for services.\n\nSo in total, the amount of exports potentially at risk from new trade barriers is greater for the 27 than for the UK.\n\nBut that is a rather crude measure of how much each side has to lose.\n\nLet's take another example to illustrate the point.\n\nWhat does Andorra have to do with Brexit?\n\nThe EU - with a population of more than half a billion and an annual economic activity or GDP of around \u00a315 trillion - has a trade surplus with Andorra, which has a population of about 80,000 and GDP of less than \u00a33bn.\n\nDoes that mean that the EU needs Andorra more than Andorra needs the EU? It would, of course, be an absurd suggestion.\n\nWhy? Because the EU's economy is so much larger.\n\nFor sure, disruptions to that trade would be a serious problem for some Spanish and French businesses and jobs near the border. But for the EU economy as a whole the impact would be tiny.\n\nNow to state the obvious, the UK is not Andorra. It matters far more to the EU as an export market than Andorra does.\n\nThat said, a more revealing measure of what is at stake is to look at the amount of trade exposed to some risk of new barriers as a percentage of either a country's total exports or GDP.\n\nTake goods first, as goods and services data is generally collected differently and is often published separately.\n\nThe EU 27 accounts for 48% of UK exports of goods, and 8% of GDP (in 2017, from the European Commission database).\n\nWhen we look at the share of the EU's exports going to the UK there is a choice to make about whether to include trade among the remaining 27 EU countries in total goods exports. If we do include it, the UK share is 6.2%; if we don't it's 18% of the total. UK exports account for 2.3% of the EU 27 GDP.\n\nYou sometimes hear the suggestion that these figures miss an important point because the two biggest players in the EU, Germany and France, are the true political driving forces in the EU. So are they any more reliant on the UK market than the EU average?\n\nFor Germany, the figures are 6.6% of goods exports going to the UK, accounting for 2.6% of GDP. The latter figure is slightly above the EU average.\n\nFor France, the equivalent figures are 6.7% of exports and 1.4% of GDP, the latter comfortably below the average for the EU as a whole.\n\nThe countries that do have a relatively large exposure to the UK are Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nAnd what about Germany's carmakers? They didn't show up for battle in the way David Davis hoped. The head of Germany's car industry association Matthias Wissman said last year: \"however important the United Kingdom is to us as a market, the cohesion of the EU 27 and their single market are even more important to our industry\".\n\nThat said, the UK would be a leading export market for the EU 27. For goods in 2017 it was very slightly behind the US, but well ahead of the next largest China. But it is important to remember: internal trade within the EU is really big for the 27.\n\nCould the 'Rotterdam effect' complicate the picture?\n\nThere is a significant complication underneath these figures, sometimes known as the Rotterdam effect.\n\nExports are generally recorded as going to their first destination. So if a container goes initially to Rotterdam in the Netherlands (or Antwerp in Belgium or some other ports) and is then transferred for onward transport to somewhere else, it is nonetheless recorded as an export to (or an import from) the Netherlands (or another EU country).\n\nIt has proved impossible to quantify this effect with any real precision. It affects figures for trade going into the UK and out.\n\nBut even if we make some fairly extreme guesses about its magnitude, the UK still exports more as a share of its own GDP to the EU 27 than the other way round.\n\nWhat about services?\n\nFor the services trade, the case is even clearer.\n\nThe UK economy is both smaller than the EU's and has a services trade surplus.\n\nIn 2016, services exports to the EU were 7.2% of UK GDP; for the EU 27 services exports to the UK were 1.1% of their GDP.\n\nAll these figures point in the same direction. The UK looks more exposed in the event of disruption to trade relations.\n\nThat is not to say the impact on the EU would be trivial, far from it.\n\nThe EU 27 would undoubtedly face significant economic harm from major disturbances to their trade with the UK. But on the basis of the trade data, the \"they need us more\" claim looks very shaky.\n\nOne point to add about the data. You may see figures elsewhere that are somewhat different.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in the way trade data are put together in different countries.\n\nSome of the figures involve converting currencies and exchange rates vary. And there variations from year to year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Gavin Williamson: UK ship in Ukraine 'sends message to Russia'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46657470", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:40", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption HMS Echo docked in the Black Sea on Friday, before Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson visited\n\nA Royal Navy warship which has been sent to Ukraine will send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's defence secretary says.\n\nHMS Echo was sent into the Black Sea earlier this month, after Russia seized three ships belonging to Ukraine's navy and their crews.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson has visited the ship in the port of Odessa.\n\nHe said the presence of the British ship shows support for Ukraine in the face of increased Russian aggression.\n\nIt will be followed by other warships as part of a more constant British presence, he said.\n\nNato has recently stepped up its operations in the Black Sea with increased warship patrols.\n\nThere are increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine over access to the area off the coast of Crimea.\n\nCrimea used to be part of an independent Ukraine, but it was annexed by Russia in 2014.

government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food.\n\nThe food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour.\n\nDame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.\n\nIt represents a real terms cut of 4.6% since last year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "'Drunk tanks' to ease NHS pressure",

available over the festive period to fund dozens of \"drunk tanks\".\n\nThese supervised units are places where revellers who have over-indulged can be checked and allowed to sleep it off.\n\nThey should help take the pressure off hospital and 999 services over the busy Christmas and new year period.\n\nSome will open later for \"Booze Black Friday\", the last Friday before Christmas, when drink sales usually peak as many office parties are held.\n\nMany will be operational on New Year's Eve.\n\nThe areas that are getting funding for drunk tanks include Soho in central London, Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Hereford, Norwich, Blackpool and Southampton.\n\nMost of these areas already provide drunk tanks in their city or town centres on Fridays and Saturdays and the funding will enable them to expand their services over the holiday season.\n\nDrunk people who need more urgent medical care will still be taken to hospital when necessary.\n\n'National Hangover Service'\n\nAbout one in seven patients who go to an accident and emergency unit is very drunk and caring for them takes staff away from other patients.\n\nThis rises to as many as seven in every 10 patients on a Friday or Saturday night.\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: \"NHS does not stand for 'National Hangover Service', which is why we want to help other organisations take care of those who just need somewhere safe to get checked over and perhaps sleep it off.\"\n\nImage caption A number of cities have already introduced drunk tanks\n\nBristol launched the UK's first drunk tank four years ago.\n\nSince then, services have been rolled out to other cities and towns across the UK, including Cardiff and Belfast, but not in Scotland.\n\nNHS England soon could roll out more of them.\n\nA study looking into how effective they are is due to come out in 2019.\n\n'Reduce demand'\n\nDrunk tanks are often funded by charities and run in partnership with the police, the ambulance service and local hospitals.\n\nThe South Central Ambulance Service is again running its SOS Service in Oxford using a dedicated \"jumbulance\", or large ambulance.\n\nLast year, the team saw 63 patients. Of these, only 14 required further treatment and/or assessment at the John Radcliffe Hospital.\n\nParamedic and team member Craig Heigold said: \"The SOS Project provides a valuable service at a time of peak demand for all local NHS and emergency services in Oxford city centre.\n\n\"By doing so, we can reduce the demand on our colleagues at A&E, as well as ensure that more Oxfordshire SCAS staff and vehicles are free to respond to non-alcohol related illnesses and injuries elsewhere in the city and surrounding areas.\n\n\"We can also provide a faster and more effective response to patients in the city centre who need us.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Have waits for GP appointments got longer?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46485457", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:00:50", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nHow long do you wait to see your GP?\n\nMembers of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group report waits of three weeks or more are common.\n\nLisa Johns said: \"Ours book five weeks ahead. For the last three weeks, I've been trying to book a standard appointment and can't get one, as they go in seconds.\"\n\nAnother member posted: \"I booked a non-urgent appointment with my GP last week.... for 22 January 2019.\"\n\nTheir experiences are backed up by statistics.\n\nEarlier this month, NHS Digital published figures showing that, while 40% of patients were seen on the day they booked, just under a fifth waited longer than a fortnight for a routine appointment with a GP or practice nurse.\n\nBut what's the story behind these figures?\n\nHave waits actually got longer?\n\nThe NHS Digital figures show of 307 million appointments booked at practices in England between November 2017 and October 2018:\n\n40% were on the day\n\n27% were within a week\n\n14.5% were in one to two weeks\n\n8% were in two to three weeks\n\n5% were in three to four weeks\n\n5% were in more than four weeks\n\nIt is the first time such figures has been published - so there aren't similar figures to compare them with. But plenty of previous research has found demand on GP services has grown. And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.' And that has a knock-on effect.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPeople were directed to their GP for lots of different things, he said. \"If you're not feeling well, go and see the GP. If you need a flu jab, go and see a GP - as if we're a one-stop shop.\"\n\nBut the RCGP said a lack of GPs was also affecting availability.\n\n\"We're now 1,000 short of the number of GPs we had when they promised 5,000 more - so now we're looking for 6,000,\" an RCGP official said.\n\nIs it safe to wait weeks for an appointment?\n\nSome patients are happy to wait. They might want to see a particular GP whom they know or someone who is familiar with their long-term health problem - it might be something that isn't going to alter over a few weeks.\n\nBut there are fears that others might be at risk from waiting.\n\nCatherine Churcher, another member of the BBC NHS Health Check Facebook group, was concerned that the most vulnerable would be least able to negotiate the system and so be worst affected,\n\n\"There must be lots of people out there who are falling through the net and not being seen because they don't have the strength or fight in them to go up against the current system,\" she said.\n\nProf Stokes-Lampard said: \"There's no hard data that shows patients are coming to harm. But that's my profound concern - that there are things that will be missed.\"\n\nAnd Dr Mahtani said: \"How do you know if the patient's condition isn't getting worse if patients are waiting three weeks? I can't tell you that they're not suffering until I see them.\n\n\"And there's always that risk that the longer waits are causing harm.\"\n\nAre all practices affected?\n\nNo - but Prof Stokes-Lampard warned that even if your practice seemed OK, it was still vulnerable to events at neighbouring GPs.\n\n\"All you need is for the practice down the road to close and then patients would be moved and your practice would be under pressure,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a domino effect. And then it's phenomenally stressful for the doctors at that practice.\"\n\nIs there anything that will help?\n\nGPs say patients can help - by calling in if they can't make an appointment, so it can be freed up for someone else, and by thinking whether they could get the advice they need somewhere else, such as the chemist's or dentist.\n\nThere are various ideas being tried out across general practice too, experimenting with taking some of the administration away from GPs and bringing in other professions, physiotherapists and social workers, into primary care in addition to the specialist nurses that many people are already familiar with.\n\nTechnology can also help - some practices have online systems where patients can book directly.\n\nBut Dr Mahtani said there was no single solution - because each practice had a different mix of patients and different skills among its staff.\n\nBetter funding was key though. \"If you invest in primary care, you will reduce your costs in secondary care - 90% of first contacts are in primary care,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to embrace general practice.\"\n\nWhat's your experience of booking a routine appointment with your GP or practice nurse?

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Charity Notes Even One Dollar Can Help A Needy Child But You\u2019d Have To Be A Dick To Give That Little", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/charity-notes-even-one-dollar-can-help-a-needy-child-bu-1831264088", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "LONDON\u2014Noting that making a difference would cost less than a single cup of coffee, the Against Malaria Foundation released an advertising campaign Friday stressing that even one dollar could help a needy child, but you\u2019d have to be a complete fucking dick to give that little. \u201cFor just one dollar out of your paycheck, you could help make sure no child has to experience this horrible disease, although what kind of a callous prick would you be to send us one measly buck?\u201d said the commercial\u2019s voiceover, explaining that any contribution was appreciated in this season of giving, but, that you would need to be a real heartless fuck of a Scrooge to look at how fortunate you are this Christmas and how little these children have and decide one-hundred pennies was the most you could possibly spare. \u201cEvery cent counts, of course.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

Yet the partial shutdown of the government that began Saturday has added another threat to a growing list of risks.\n\n\n\nThe stock market's persistent fall, growing chaos in the Trump administration, higher interest rates, a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown have combined to elevate the perils for the economy.\n\n\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he thinks the underlying fundamentals for growth remain strong and that the expansion will continue. But he cautioned that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves.\n\n\n\n\"What really matters is how people perceive these headwinds \u2014 and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment,'' Daco said.\n\n\n\nMany economic barometers still look encouraging. Unemployment is near a half-century low. Inflation is tame. Pay growth has picked up. Consumers boosted their spending this holiday season. Indeed, the latest figures indicate that the economy has been fundamentally healthy during the final month of 2018.\n\n\n\nStill, financial markets were rattled Thursday by President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government unless his border wall is funded as part of a measure to finance the government \u2014 a threat that became reality on Saturday. As tensions with the incoming Democratic House majority have reached a fever pitch, Trump warned Friday that he foresees a \"very long'' shutdown.\n\n\n\nThe expanding picture of a dysfunctional Trump administration grew further with the surprise resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis in protest of Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria \u2014 a move that drew expressions of alarm from many Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\n\n\nHow markets and government officials respond to such risks could determine whether the second-longest U.S. expansion on record remains on course or succumbs eventually to a recession.\n\n\n\nA closer look at the risks:\n\n\n\nAdministration chaos\n\n\n\nIt has been a tumultuous few days, even for a White House that has been defined by the president's daily dramas.\n\n\n\nTrump faces an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections that has led to indictments and criminal convictions of some of his closest confidants. He is coping with a wave of top staff defections, having lost both his chief of staff and defense secretary. He is in the process of installing a new attorney general.\n\n\n\nThen there is the partial government shutdown that Trump himself has pushed.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown is unlikely to hurt economic growth very much, even if it lasts awhile, because 75 percent of the government is still being funded. S&P Global Ratings estimates that each week of the shutdown would shave a relatively minuscule $1.2 billion off the nation's gross domestic product.\n\n\n\nStill, the problem is that the Trump administration appears disinclined to cooperate with the incoming House Democratic majority. So the federal support through deficit spending that boosted the economy this year will likely wane, Lewis Alexander, U.S. chief economist at Nomura, said in his 2019 outlook.\n\n\n\nThat, in part, is why the economy is widely expected to weaken from its roughly 3 percent growth this year, which would be the strongest performance since 2005.\n\n\n\nTumbling stocks\n\nStock investors have been trampled since October, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking nearly 15 percent. The plunge followed a propulsive winning streak for the stock market that began in 2009. But investors are internalizing all the latest risks, including Trump's trade war with China and higher borrowing rates, and how much they might depress corporate profits and the economy.\n\n\"Markets people are forward-looking, so they're taking into account the latest information,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\n\n\nMarkets can often fall persistently without sending the economy into a tailspin. But O'Sullivan warned of a possible feedback loop in which tumbling stock prices would erode consumer and business confidence, which in turn could send stocks sinking further. At that point, the economy would likely worsen, the job market would weaken and many ordinary households would suffer.\n\n\n\nTrade war\n\nFor economists, this may pose the gravest threat to the economy. Trump has imposed tariffs against a huge swath of goods from China, which has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products. These import taxes tend to dampen economic activity and diminish growth.\n\n\n\n\"The trade war with China is now the biggest impediment to U.S. economic growth,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in his forecast for the first half of 2019.\n\n\n\nIn part because of the taxes Trump imposed on Chinese imports, manufacturing growth appears to be slowing, with factory owners facing higher costs for raw materials. The president has held off on further escalating tariffs to see if an agreement, or at least a lasting truce, can be reached with China by March.\n\n\n\nAny damage from trade wars tends to worsen the longer the disputes continue. So even a tentative resolution in the first three months of 2019 could remove one threat to economic growth.\n\n\n\nInterest rate hikes\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised a key short-term rate four times this year and envisions two more increases in 2019. Stocks sold off Wednesday after Chairman Jerome Powell laid out the rationale. Powell's explanation, in large part, was that the Fed could gradually raise borrowing costs and limit potential U.S. economic growth because of the job market's strength.\n\nThe Fed generally raises rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent. But inflation has been running consistently below that target.\n\n\n\nIf the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast, it could trigger the very downturn that Fed officials have been trying to avoid. This has become a nagging fear for investors.\n\n\n\nGlobal slowdown\n\n\n\nThe world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift, with many U.S. trading partners, especially in Europe and Asia, weakening or expected to expand at a slower speed.

McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.\n\nAppointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.\n\nHis letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump tweeted his response to the resignation:\n\nIn a tweet shortly after news of McGurk\u2019s resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We\u2019re coming home!\u201d\n\nAlthough the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.\n\nMcGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis\u2019 resignation, according to the official.\n\nTrump declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts\u2019 assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash and dangerous.\n\nMattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because \u201cyou have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\nTrump defended his decision Saturday to order the troop withdrawal, tweeting, \"Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!\"\n\nThe withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump\u2019s goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.\n\nAmong officials\u2019 key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America\u2019s only military partner in Syria\n\nA second official said McGurk on Friday was pushing for the U.S. to allow the SDF to reach out to troops allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government for protection. McGurk argued that America had a moral obligation to help prevent the allied fighters from being slaughtered by Turkey, which considers the SDF an enemy.\n\nMcGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that \u201cit would be reckless if we were just to say, \u2018Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.\u2019 I think anyone who\u2019s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\u201d\n\nA week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.\n\nMcGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.\n\nMcGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nA former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush\u2019s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.\n\nTaking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.\n\nJim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.\n\nIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.\n\nBut that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants. Military officials have also made it clear that IS fighters fleeing Euphrates River region have found refuge in other areas of the country, fueling concerns that they could regroup and rise again.\n\nThe SDF said Thursday: \u201cThe war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.\u201d\n\nVOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Cancer the Latest Health Woe for Resilient Justice Ginsburg", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cancer-the-latest-health-woe-for-resilient-justice-ginsburg/4712160.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resting in a New York hospital following surgery to remove two malignant growths in her left lung, the third time the Supreme Court\u2019s oldest justice has been treated for cancer and her second stay in a hospital in two months.\n\nWorries over Ginsburg\u2019s health have been a constant of sorts for nearly 10 years, and for liberals, particularly in the last two. Ginsburg, the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing and known to her fans as the Notorious RBG, has achieved an iconic status rare for Supreme Court justices.\n\nIf she did step down, President Donald Trump would have another opportunity to move a conservative court even more to the right. \u201cWishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!\u201d Trump tweeted after the court\u2019s announcement Friday.\n\nBut Ginsburg has always bounced back before, flaunting her physical and mental fitness.\n\nAfter past health scares, she has resumed the exercise routine popularized in a book written by her personal trainer and captured in a Stephen Colbert video. Weeks after cracking three ribs in a fall at the Supreme Court in November, the 85-year-old Ginsburg was asking questions at high court arguments, speaking at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens and being interviewed at screenings of the new movie about her, \u201cOn the Basis of Sex.\u201d\n\nGinsburg will remain in the hospital for a few days, the court said. She has never missed arguments in more than 25 years as a justice. The court next meets on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to refer to good luck and cancer diagnoses in the same breath, this is the second time for Ginsburg that cancerous growths have been detected at an apparently early stage through unrelated medical tests.\n\nThe nodules on her lung were found during X-rays and other tests Ginsburg had after she fractured ribs in a fall in her Supreme Court office on Nov. 7, the court said. In 2009, routine follow-up screening after Ginsburg\u2019s colorectal cancer 10 years earlier detected a lesion on her pancreas. Doctors operated and removed the growth they\u2019d previously spotted, plus a smaller one they hadn\u2019t seen before. The larger growth was benign, while the smaller one was malignant.\n\nDoctors who are not involved in Ginsburg\u2019s care said she may have gotten lucky again, although they caution it is too soon to know.\n\n\u201cThis is just luck\u201d that the growths were found through those rib X-rays because accidentally discovered lung tumors tend to be early-stage when surgery works best, said Dr. Giuseppe Giaccone, an oncologist at Georgetown University\u2019s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nDr. John Lazar, director of thoracic robotic surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said it\u2019s not uncommon to see slow-growing lung cancers in women in their 80s, and they tend to respond well to surgery and go on to die of something unrelated, he said.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s previous bouts with cancer were so long ago they\u2019re unlikely to be related, Giaccone said.\n\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t need anything but the surgery, it is a very good sign,\u201d Lazar said.\n\nBoth doctors said patients typically spend three days or four days in the hospital after this type of operation.\n\nOn Friday, doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York performed a procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Ginsburg. The growths they removed were determined to be malignant in an initial pathology evaluation, the court said, citing Ginsburg\u2019s thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie W. Rusch.\n\nBut there was \u201cno evidence of any remaining disease\u201d and scans taken before the surgery showed no cancerous growths elsewhere in her body, the court said. No additional treatment is currently planned, it said.\n\nAmong other health problems, she also broke two ribs in a fall in 2012 and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. She was hospitalized after a bad reaction to medicine in 2009.\n\nAppointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg rebuffed suggestions from some liberals that she should step down in the first two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, when Democrats controlled the Senate and would have been likely to confirm her successor.\n\nShe already has hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to retire."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Federal Shutdown Compounds Risks for US Economy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-shutdown-compounds-risks-for-us-economy-/4712617.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Now in its 10th year, America's economic expansion still looks sturdy. Yet the partial shutdown of the government that began Saturday has added another threat to a growing list of risks.\n\n\n\nThe stock market's persistent fall, growing chaos in the Trump administration, higher interest rates, a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown have combined to elevate the perils for the economy.\n\n\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he thinks the underlying fundamentals for growth remain strong and that the expansion will continue. But he cautioned that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves.\n\n\n\n\"What really matters is how people perceive these headwinds \u2014 and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment,'' Daco said.\n\n\n\nMany economic barometers still look encouraging. Unemployment is near a half-century low. Inflation is tame. Pay growth has picked up. Consumers boosted their spending this holiday season. Indeed, the latest figures indicate that the economy has been fundamentally healthy during the final month of 2018.\n\n\n\nStill, financial markets were rattled Thursday by President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government unless his border wall is funded as part of a measure to finance the government \u2014 a threat that became reality on Saturday. As tensions with the incoming Democratic House majority have reached a fever pitch, Trump warned Friday that he foresees a \"very long'' shutdown.\n\n\n\nThe expanding picture of a dysfunctional Trump administration grew further with the surprise resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis in protest of Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria \u2014 a move that drew expressions of alarm from many Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\n\n\nHow markets and government officials respond to such risks could determine whether the second-longest U.S. expansion on record remains on course or succumbs eventually to a recession.\n\n\n\nA closer look at the risks:\n\n\n\nAdministration chaos\n\n\n\nIt has been a tumultuous few days, even for a White House that has been defined by the president's daily dramas.\n\n\n\nTrump faces an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections that has led to indictments and criminal convictions of some of his closest confidants. He is coping with a wave of top staff defections, having lost both his chief of staff and defense secretary. He is in the process of installing a new attorney general.\n\n\n\nThen there is the partial government shutdown that Trump himself has pushed.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown is unlikely to hurt economic growth very much, even if it lasts awhile, because 75 percent of the government is still being funded. S&P Global Ratings estimates that each week of the shutdown would shave a relatively minuscule $1.2 billion off the nation's gross domestic product.\n\n\n\nStill, the problem is that the Trump administration appears disinclined to cooperate with the incoming House Democratic majority. So the federal support through deficit spending that boosted the economy this year will likely wane, Lewis Alexander, U.S. chief economist at Nomura, said in his 2019 outlook.\n\n\n\nThat, in part, is why the economy is widely expected to weaken from its roughly 3 percent growth this year, which would be the strongest performance since 2005.\n\n\n\nTumbling stocks\n\nStock investors have been trampled since October, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking nearly 15 percent. The plunge followed a propulsive winning streak for the stock market that began in 2009. But investors are internalizing all the latest risks, including Trump's trade war with China and higher borrowing rates, and how much they might depress corporate profits and the economy.\n\n\"Markets people are forward-looking, so they're taking into account the latest information,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\n\n\nMarkets can often fall persistently without sending the economy into a tailspin. But O'Sullivan warned of a possible feedback loop in which tumbling stock prices would erode consumer and business confidence, which in turn could send stocks sinking further. At that point, the economy would likely worsen, the job market would weaken and many ordinary households would suffer.\n\n\n\nTrade war\n\nFor economists, this may pose the gravest threat to the economy. Trump has imposed tariffs against a huge swath of goods from China, which has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. products. These import taxes tend to dampen economic activity and diminish growth.\n\n\n\n\"The trade war with China is now the biggest impediment to U.S. economic growth,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in his forecast for the first half of 2019.\n\n\n\nIn part because of the taxes Trump imposed on Chinese imports, manufacturing growth appears to be slowing, with factory owners facing higher costs for raw materials. The president has held off on further escalating tariffs to see if an agreement, or at least a lasting truce, can be reached with China by March.\n\n\n\nAny damage from trade wars tends to worsen the longer the disputes continue. So even a tentative resolution in the first three months of 2019 could remove one threat to economic growth.\n\n\n\nInterest rate hikes\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised a key short-term rate four times this year and envisions two more increases in 2019. Stocks sold off Wednesday after Chairman Jerome Powell laid out the rationale. Powell's explanation, in large part, was that the Fed could gradually raise borrowing costs and limit potential U.S. economic growth because of the job market's strength.\n\nThe Fed generally raises rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent. But inflation has been running consistently below that target.\n\n\n\nIf the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast, it could trigger the very downturn that Fed officials have been trying to avoid. This has become a nagging fear for investors.\n\n\n\nGlobal slowdown\n\n\n\nThe world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift, with many U.S. trading partners, especially in Europe and Asia, weakening or expected to expand at a slower speed. Their deflating growth can, in turn, weigh down the U.S. economy.\n\n\n\nSeveral other global risks abound. There is Britain's turbulent exit from the European Union. Italy appears close to recession and is struggling to manage its debt. China, the world's second-largest economy after the U.S., is trying to manage a slowdown in growth that is being complicated by its trade war with Trump.\n\n\n\n\"Next year is likely to be challenging for both investors and policymakers,'' Alexander, the Nomura economist, concluded in his outlook."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "States Help Run US National Parks During Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/states-help-run-us-national-parks-during-shutdown-/4712330.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. national parks will be left with just a skeleton staff during the federal government shutdown, and several states are using their own funds to make sure public restrooms get cleaned and visitor centers stay open.\n\n\n\nThe shutdown of all but essential federal services because of a Capitol Hill fight over U.S. President Donald Trump's funding demands for a Mexico border wall comes at the height of the Christmas travel season.\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service said this week that parks will remain \"as accessible as possible.\" During a three-day government shutdown in January, the gates to about two-thirds of national parks and monuments remained open.\n\n\n\n\"Services that require staffing and maintenance such as campgrounds and full-service restrooms will not be operating,\" Jeremy Barnum, the National Park Service chief spokesman, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Republican governors of Utah and Arizona have promised to step in, in part to help protect local businesses in and around some of the country's most spectacular natural landscapes that depend on tourist spending.\n\nNot 'on our watch'\n\n\n\n\"Regardless of what happens in Washington, the Grand Canyon will not close on our watch,\" Arizona Gov.

Below is what will happen at some of the agencies and departments affected by the shutdown.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security\n\n\n\nThe department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected by the shutdown.\n\n\n\nBut most of those agencies' employees are considered essential, so they will need to work without pay until a government funding bill is passed.\n\n\n\nOf the 245,000 people who work under the department's umbrella, nearly 213,000 have been deemed essential, according to the department's contingency plan.\n\n\n\nHousing and Urban Development\n\n\n\nOf the department's 7,500 employees, only 343 are expected to work. Nearly 1,000 other people may be called in to work on specific tasks, for which they will not be paid until a funding bill is passed.\n\nThough public housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities are not part of the federal government and are not required to shut down, some of their funding is provided by the federal government, so they may need to reduce or change normal operating hours.\n\n\n\nThe department, which is also responsible for some housing loans and low-income housing payments, said in its contingency plan a shutdown would likely not significantly affect the housing market.\n\n\n\nBut, it added, \"a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we've been experiencing.\"\n\n\n\nInterior\n\n\n\nThe National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, will have a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, no national parks will be open and no visitor services \u2014 including restrooms, facility maintenance and trash collection \u2014 will be provided.\n\n\n\nBut some governors have pledged to step in, including in Arizona, the site of the Grand Canyon, and New York, where the state has provided funding for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to stay open.\n\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\n\nOf the department's 55,000 employees, 20,400 will be put on leave. Those employees do not include most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 will be working, or the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources.\n\n\n\nAir traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations will continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits will be paused.\n\n\n\nExecutive Office of the President\n\n\n\nAn estimated 1,100 of the office's 1,800 employees would be placed on leave. This will include most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps the president implement his budget and policy goals."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Shutdown to Continue as Senate Adjourns Until Thursday", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/shutdown-to-continue-as-senate-adjourns-until-thursday/4712298.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "As talks dragged on between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding for his border wall, the U.S. Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon, with no plans to meet until Thursday.\n\nA partial government shutdown, which began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, was triggered by Congress' inability to agree on a funding measure to keep the government open. The shutdown affected more than 800,000 federal employees, more than half of whom will continue to work without pay.\n\nShortly before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky announced the Senate would adjourn until Dec. 27, reporters said Vice President Mike Pence had arrived at the Capitol to speak with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nMcConnell said the Senate would meet in a \"pro forma\" session Monday, but those sessions are brief, sometimes lasting just minutes.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Trump discussed border security with Republican lawmakers and senior aides at the White House. During a conference call Saturday with reporters, a senior administration official was asked why Democrats were not present at the meeting when Trump had repeatedly said they were responsible for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cIt's important that Senate Democrats come to the table and begin to negotiate with us,\u201d the official said. \u201cConversations last night did occur. We hope those continue this day, tomorrow and into the future. But it is important for them to acknowledge that border security, physical barriers, need to be part of this package.\"\n\nMcConnell said any agreement on a funding measure would need to be approved by the president and congressional leaders before it could come to a vote.\n\nDemocrats' leaders\n\nSchumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California issued a joint statement Saturday saying, \"Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible and effective border security \u2014 not the president's ineffective and expensive wall.\"\n\nAfter the Senate had adjourned, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House, \"Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C., and the first lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together.\"\n\nThe Senate late Wednesday approved by voice vote a stopgap measure that would have prevented the shutdown, but it did not include $5 billion Trump wanted for the border wall, and he balked on Thursday at signing it.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives then passed a temporary spending bill Thursday that included $5.7 billion for the wall and funding to keep the government running until Feb. 8. On Friday, the Senate advanced that bill with a procedural vote that provided \"flexibility\" to continue negotiating, McConnell said. But, facing a midnight deadline, Republican leaders could not produce the 60 votes needed for passage.\n\nSenators adjourned, and about a quarter of the government ran out of funds at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.\n\nTrump and Democrats blamed each other for the shutdown. After previously saying he would \"proudly\" accept responsibility for it if Congress did not pass legislation that included funding for the wall, Trump tweeted Friday, \"The Democrats now own the shutdown!\"\n\nSchumer told colleagues on the Senate floor Friday that Trump was making unilateral decisions that were creating chaos throughout the world.\n\n'Abandon' plan, Trump told\n\n\"All of this turmoil is causing chaos in the markets, chaos abroad and it's making the United States less prosperous and less secure,\" Schumer said. \"There are not the votes in the Senate for an expensive taxpayer-funded border wall. So President Trump, you will not get your wall. Abandon your shutdown strategy.\"\n\nMcConnell argued for the wall's funding, saying, \"The need for greater security on our southern border is not some partisan invention. It's an empirical fact and the need is only growing.\"\n\nTrump has said his proposed wall, whose total estimated cost is $20 million, will thwart illegal immigration. Construction of the wall was a popular rallying cry at Trump campaign events during his successful 2016 run for the White House. Trump also told his supporters that Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nThe senior official stressed to reporters on Saturday's conference call that the administration continues to believe Mexico will pay for the wall, but the White House is not going to \"wait on negotiations\" with Mexico to be able to start its construction. He added that president was not insisting the wall has to be \"some kind of concrete barrier\" and that he was open to a \"steel slat\" structure.\n\nThe dispute was occurring in the last days of Republican control of both houses of Congress. Democrats picked up 40 seats in the 435-member House in the November elections and are set assume control in early January, although Republicans will maintain their edge in the Senate.\n\nThe Schumer-Pelosi statement on Saturday said that \"if President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to reopen government in January.\"\n\nPatsy Widakuswara at the White House contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Envoy to Anti-IS Coalition Quits Over Trump\u2019s Syria Move", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-department-says-special-envoy-mcgurk-resigns/4712187.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest over President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a U.S. official said, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security figures.\n\nOnly 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be \u201creckless\u201d to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.\n\nAppointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.\n\nHis letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump tweeted his response to the resignation:\n\nIn a tweet shortly after news of McGurk\u2019s resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhen I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We\u2019re coming home!\u201d\n\nAlthough the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.\n\nMcGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis\u2019 resignation, according to the official.\n\nTrump declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts\u2019 assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash and dangerous.\n\nMattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because \u201cyou have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\u201d\n\nTrump defended his decision Saturday to order the troop withdrawal, tweeting, \"Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!\"\n\nThe withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump\u2019s goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria\u2019s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.\n\nAmong officials\u2019 key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America\u2019s only military partner in Syria\n\nA second official said McGurk on Friday was pushing for the U.S. to allow the SDF to reach out to troops allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government for protection. McGurk argued that America had a moral obligation to help prevent the allied fighters from being slaughtered by Turkey, which considers the SDF an enemy.\n\nMcGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that \u201cit would be reckless if we were just to say, \u2018Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.\u2019 I think anyone who\u2019s looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.\u201d\n\nA week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.\n\nMcGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.\n\nMcGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nA former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush\u2019s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.\n\nTaking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.\n\nJim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.\n\nIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.\n\nBut that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants. Military officials have also made it clear that IS fighters fleeing Euphrates River region have found refuge in other areas of the country, fueling concerns that they could regroup and rise again.\n\nThe SDF said Thursday: \u201cThe war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.\u201d\n\nVOA contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Most Babies Born With Cleft Condition Could Die Without Surgery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/most-babies-born-with-cleft-condition-could-die-without-surgery/4711475.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "One of the most common birth defects in the world is a cleft lip.

But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement. And drug trials toward the end of the West Africa outbreak produced evidence about the vaccine that\u2019s now being deployed.\n\nBut pregnant women weren\u2019t included in those trials, and researchers collected little in the way of data about the burden pregnant women and their offspring face.\n\n\u201cPregnant women are continuously getting left out of the benefits of scientific advancement in medicine,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to fail to collect the kinds of data that we need, to generate the kind of evidence that we need and to also have interventions that meet the broader population\u2019s needs,\u201d Krubiner said, \u201cthen we\u2019re just going to continue to perpetuate the cycle.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "A Small Device with a Big Impact for Blind and Visually Impaired", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/small-device-with-a-big-impact-for-blind-and-visually-impaired/4712311.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Some 1.3 billion people live with some form of vision impairment, according to the World Health Organization.

In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "DC Sues Facebook Over Cambridge Analytica's Data Use", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/dc-sues-facebook-over-cambridge-analytica-s-data-use/4708039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The attorney general for Washington, D.C., said Wednesday that the nation's capital had sued Facebook over reports involving Cambridge Analytica's use of data from the social media giant.\n\n\"Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users and deceived them about who had access to their data and how it was used,\" Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. \"Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users' permission.\"\n\nThe lawsuit came as Facebook faced new reports that it shared its users' data without their permission.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign at one point, gained access to personal data from tens of millions of Facebook's users.

Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria, known as John of God, \u201cwas a medium of prestige here in Brazil,\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. His devoted followers believed he had the power to heal through \u201cspiritual surgeries\u201d and felt betrayed and even defensive when women began accusing him of abusing them under the guise of treatment. Some people even protested in front of his spiritual retreat in solidarity with him, Andr\u00e9a added.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about this story, though, is how seriously the investigation is being taken and how quickly Faria was arrested \u2014 despite his reputation as a beloved and powerful figure. In a matter of days, more than 500 women filed complaints against Faria, leading authorities to arrest him Dec. 16 and charge him Dec. 20 with \u201csexual violation through fraud,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nHuffPost Brazil decided to make this the focus of its coverage. \u201cWe have chosen, first of all, to emphasize the importance of women\u2019s denunciations [against Faria],\u201d Andr\u00e9a said. \u201cWe know that specifically in Brazil, cases of sexual violence are underreported for a number of reasons \u2014 among them not only shame and fear, but also the fact that powerful men are involved.\u201d\n\nThe swift investigation into Faria highlights how important it is for survivors to report their abusers and the collective power of women\u2019s voices, Andrea said.\n\n\u201cI think this is the main nuance that this case brings: The voice of women strengthens the denunciations [against Faria] and provides a basis for a solid investigation against a man who, according to them, committed a series of violent acts in moments of fragility as they searched for connection with the divine.\u201d\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nCourtesy of Tila House\n\nEarlier this year, ARTnews Magazine devoted an issue to the status of women in the art world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it revealed staggering gender gaps in the prices artists fetch at auction, as well as in opportunities to show and sell work. Black women have even less of a presence in the art world, representing just 4 percent of artists at leading U.S. fine art institutions, HuffPost U.S. reported. But one artist is aiming to change that. HuffPost U.S. spoke this week with Tiffany LaTrice, the founder of an Atlanta-based arts incubator, co-working and gallery space devoted to empowering black women artists. Tila Studios is already making an impact: It raised enough money this year to send 10 black women artists to Miami\u2019s Art Basel, one of the largest commercial art fairs in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to disrupt the traditional and kind of stale industry that hasn\u2019t really seen a lot of shakeup,\u201d LaTrice said. \u201cSo [we went] down there to kind of shake things up.\u201d\n\nChatiyanon via Getty Images\n\nBoth HuffPost U.S. and HuffPost Canada reported this week on proposals that would make menstrual hygiene products available to more women who can\u2019t afford them.

The going rate for a pair of tampons in U.S. prisons is $5.55(!) \u2014 beyond what most inmates can afford, HuffPost U.S. reported. Meanwhile, in Canada, two drugstores in downtown Toronto are preparing to offer free menstrual products to homeless and low-income women. \u201cUntil 2015, Canada treated menstrual products as taxable \u2018luxury items,\u2019\u201d the article notes.

It is used by Muslims to denote items that fit within various Islamic requirements, such as restrictions against the pork-based gelatin found in some candies. Businesses that want to take advantage of the growing demand for halal foods often get their products verified by halal certification agencies. A similar process exists for businesses catering to Jewish customers who want to know that their food is certified kosher.\n\nHermann J.

The chocolate bar\u2019s production process essentially met halal criteria even before the official certification, she said.\n\nMondel\u0113z suggested the company\u2019s decision to get halal-certified stemmed from a desire to cater to customers around the world.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to make products everyone can enjoy,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThat is why it\u2019s important to us to respond to the different preferences and food requirements of our broad range of consumers worldwide.\u201d\n\nStill, businesses\u2019 desire for halal certifications has fueled conspiracy theories among the far right about Islam\u2019s influence on European communities.

The president called it a \u201cnothing event\u201d by a \u201cgrandstander.\u201d\n\nMcGurk informed the administration Friday that he was leaving Dec. 31. The notice came a day after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also tendered his resignation in the wake of the president\u2019s sudden decision to yank all American troops out of Syria.\n\nMcGurk, who planned to leave his post in mid-February, moved up his resignation in protest over Trump\u2019s decision. Earlier this month he called any decision to draw down Syrian troops \u201creckless\u201d in the fight against ISIS, and was concerned about abandoning longtime allies in the region, particularly the Kurds, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cThe recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us,\u201d McGurk said in an email to his colleagues, The New York Times reported. \u201cIt left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered. I ultimately concluded that I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know McGurk\u201d and that the \u201cfake news\u201d media was making a \u201cbig deal\u201d out of a \u201cnothing event.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cgrandstander\u201d insult was similar to an ugly, but fatuous, dig against former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump also called a \u201cgrandstander\u201d \u2014 as well as a \u201cshowboat.\u201d\n\nBrett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.

McGurk is a seasoned professional with a profound understanding of ISIS and its role in the Mideast. McGurk is largely credited with working with the regional coalition to slash the territory controlled by ISIS in half by the time Trump took office, according to the Times.\n\nNow ISIS has just 1 percent of the territory it held at the height of its power. That led Trump to declare earlier this month that ISIS was \u201cdefeated\u201d in Syria. But experts have warned that the job is not completed, and if ISIS is given more leeway it can resurrect as a major force again in the region and around the world.\n\nMcGurk\u2019s predecessor, Gen.

In 2011, for example, the state cut its family planning budget by two-thirds, which led to an increase in teen abortions and births.

You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families.

See the other entries here between now and the new year.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Jim Knaver and his wife, Anna Hastings (known as Toni), spotted a little smoke in the air from their home in Paradise, California. They knew the risks of fire and had diligently cleared any flammable debris from their property. Jim checked the news for fire danger, he later told NPR, then drove to teach his fourth-grade class. Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate. Later that morning, the Camp Fire roared through Paradise at unprecedented speed. Without transportation or even the means to flee on foot, Toni couldn\u2019t get out. Jim lost touch over the phone around 11 a.m. Five days later, search teams confirmed they had found Toni\u2019s remains.\n\nWe live in an era of flood and fire. That disasters like the Camp Fire and the devastating hurricanes that have struck the U.S. in recent years are more frequent and more severe because of human-caused climate change is an indisputable scientific fact. Unless something changes, as the waters rise and the air grows thick with smoke, as medicines run out and food systems collapse, as higher, wetter, or more fertile ground becomes the only resource that matters, millions of people like Toni \u2015 millions of poor and non-wealthy, elderly, people with disabilities \u2015 are going to die.\n\nThere has never been a threat to humanity quite like catastrophic climate change. First, while most great disasters spring upon us quickly, we\u2019ve known the threat has been coming for almost 200 years. Second, we now have the technology to ameliorate the worst of the consequences, which is again unprecedented in human history. We couldn\u2019t have stopped the Black Death, for example, but the decarbonization of society is possible. Instead, year after year, things get worse, and we still do nothing. Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history. The green technology thus far deployed will have no more effect than pouring a thimbleful of water on a raging blaze.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen the worst happens, disabled people will die first. The problems extend far beyond wheelchair users who cannot physically evacuate through inaccessible areas. For example, I am mentally disabled. Without access to psychiatric medication, I wonder whether I could stave off suicidal ideation in the face of local climate collapse. Think about all the people who require insulin, chemotherapy, specialized nourishment pumped into their stomach, or people who can\u2019t access a shelter because it has no ramp or because crowds make them panic. The threats extend across categories.\n\nIn November, Alice Wong, a Bay Area resident and global disability justice leader, wrote about receiving air quality alerts as smoke from the fires more than 160 miles away made it dangerous to go outside. She knew she was privileged to stay home with her air purifier but rightly worried for those with lung-related conditions who lacked homes, access to masks, or other medical support.\n\nMarcie Roth, former FEMA official and currently CEO of the National Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, tells me there\u2019s been a \u201cfailure to plan. And a failure to meet the equal access requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate change adaptation folks are not really talking to the disaster risk reduction folks who are not really talking to the humanitarian relief folks who are not really talking to the CRPD [U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] folks who are not really talking to the strategic development/plan folks,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much siloing going on.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Roth argued that lack of planning for inclusive disaster relief puts everyone at risk, writing, \u201cA resilient community will plan for \u2013 and with \u2013 all of its members.\u201d\n\nWe can fix this. Not only can we focus our disaster responses on the most vulnerable people, but we can elect representatives who are willing to say the word, \u201cdecarbonization.\u201d As the 2020 Democratic Primary begins (it\u2019s already begun), who will be brave enough to speak up for those already being killed by climate change?

A 7-month-old baby reportedly choked on the beads of a wooden teething bracelet and had to be taken to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risks we\u2019ve observed with these products and want parents to be aware that teething jewelry puts children, including those with special needs, at risk of serious injury and death,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., said in a statement.\n\nThe beads of teething jewelry may be made of silicone, wood, or other materials, including amber. The manufacturers of amber teething necklaces claim that a baby\u2019s body temperature warms the amber, releasing a pain-relieving chemical that can be absorbed through their skin to relieve teething pain.\n\nAnd indeed, that chemical, called succinate or succinic acid, has been shown to have some therapeutic benefits. But the FDA has not tested the necklace manufacturers\u2019 claims for safety or effectiveness.\n\nPetardj via Getty Images Teething rings can pose a severe hazard, according to the FDA.\n\nDr. Jaime Friedman, a San Diego-based pediatrician, praised the FDA for issuing the warning. Friedman says that parents rarely ask for her advice on these teething necklaces before they buy one for their baby, but she frequently sees patients wearing them during appointments.\n\nFriedman makes it a point to counsel caregivers away from using them by bringing up choking and strangulation risks, as well as the unknown effects about the amber itself.\n\n\u201cI have not, as of yet, seen that there\u2019s any evidence of [succinic] acid in the bloodstream,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you do have this acid in the bloodstream, do we know what it\u2019s doing? No, I don\u2019t think we do.\u201d\n\nFriedman, who is an official spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics and affiliated with Children\u2019s Primary Care Medical Group, said that if parents insist on using the necklaces, she advises them to not let babies wear them unsupervised. That means no jewelry while they sleep, or while sitting in a car seat if an adult can\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s unsolicited advice, but hey, that\u2019s my job right? To protect kids,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has taken a strong stance against other at-home teething pain remedies, including numbing gels or creams for gums, as well as homeopathic teething tablets that were found to contain belladonna, a poisonous plant that can be dangerous to people.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caregivers give their babies a teething ring that has been chilled in the fridge to numb the pain. However, it warns against freezing teething rings, as frozen rings can damage gums. Another safe option for caregivers would be for them to use a clean finger to gently rub or massage their baby\u2019s gums."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric Hurts The Health Of Latino Families, Even Those Here Legally", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-immigration-health-latino-families_us_5c1938dee4b08db990586083", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Facing critics who have decried these tactics as cruel and immoral, President Donald Trump continues to trumpet his administration\u2019s immigration policies and has doubled down on calls for a border wall with inflammatory rhetoric that stokes fear and distrust.\n\nThat kind of language, public health experts warn, can be damaging in its own right \u2014 especially among Latinos, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\u201cWe know that deportations and family separations at the border are incredibly disruptive and traumatic to youth and their families. The detrimental impacts of family separations on child development and family systems are serious and long-lasting,\u201d said Dr. Laura Wray-Lake, a UCLA associate professor who has studied how Latinx teens react to immigration policies under Trump. \u201cWhat we\u2019re also coming to understand is that even for youth and families who are not directly threatened by these deportation or family separation policies, the policy climate is creating a more hostile and unsafe environment.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s enforcement tactics are fomenting fear \u2014 and that fear has consequences for health and well-being.\n\nThe ongoing threat of deportation is a form of psychological violence against the whole community.\n\nOne out of every four children in the U.S. is Latino, according to Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez, an assistant professor in the department of population health at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, and \u201cthe vast majority of these children are U.S.-born citizens.\u201d Yet even kids who are documented and legally protected from deportation can feel the emotional burden of an anti-immigrant climate.\n\n\u201cLatinx youth are following immigration politics and they can identify the injustices in what language is being used to describe immigrants and how policies are being applied to immigrants,\u201d said Wray-Lake.\n\n\u201cCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez. \u201cDehumanization is never healthy.\u201d\n\nCurrent discourse about immigrants and immigration tends to be dehumanizing. Dehumanization is never healthy. Dr. R. Gabriela Barajas-Gonzalez\n\nIn a comprehensive analysis of existing research, published in September, Barajas-Gonzalez and other researchers looked at how anti-immigrant rhetoric, dehumanizing language and aggressive immigration enforcement practices were harming Latino children. They found that those who belonged to mixed-status families, which have at least one citizen or legal immigrant child and at least one undocumented parent, dealt with persistent stress and emotional discomfort.\n\n\u201cMixed-status families may change their daily activities in attempts to protect themselves, consequently becoming more socially isolated,\u201d said Barajas-Gonzalez, who led the report. \u201cFor some children, the stigma associated with being from an immigrant family, experiences with discrimination and increased consciousness of legal status is marked by fear, hyperawareness and hypervigilance.\u201d\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images Sandra Chica holds the hands of her daughters during a rally and press conference in support of husband Pablo Villavicencio, who was detained in early June by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after making a catering delivery to Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn.\n\nChildren with these symptoms \u2015 which can also be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety \u2015 tend to be constantly on guard and tense, Barajas-Gonzalez added. \u201cThis state of arousal can be exhausting and impede children\u2019s ability to focus in school,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Kathleen Roche, an associate professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University, agrees. \u201cCitizen children of immigrant parents face risks to their mental health and school success when their parents suffer from elevated psychological distress,\u201d she added.\n\nFear is preventing Latino families from getting medical care.\n\nRoche was the lead author on a March report by GWU\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health that looked at how immigration news and changes in enforcement tactics impacted Latino parents and their teenage children in the U.S.\n\n\u201cFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos,\u201d she said. As a result, people weren\u2019t seeking help to take care of their own health, safety and well-being.\n\nResearchers surveyed 213 Latino \u2015 mostly Central American \u2015 parents of teens in a suburb of a large mid-Atlantic city (the location was not named to protect the identities of the study participants). While some of those parents were undocumented, more than two-thirds were living in the U.S. legally as citizens, permanent residents or under temporary protected status.\n\nSixty-six percent of participants reported being worried \u201cvery often or always\u201d about family members getting separated and nearly 40 percent said they \u201cfrequently avoided getting medical care, help from police, or support from social services.\u201d\n\nFear and psychological harm triggered by recent immigration events appear to spill over into the lives of legally residing U.S. Latinos. Dr. Kathleen Roche\n\nOf the parents surveyed, only those who were U.S. citizens seemed \u201cprotected from the harmful consequences of immigration policy changes,\u201d Roche said.\n\nA University of California survey of health care providers, published in July, supports these findings. In that report, 42 percent of providers said children in immigrant families were increasingly missing scheduled medical appointments and 38 percent said immigrant families were increasingly not scheduling routine prevention or primary care appointments for their kids.\n\nEven unborn babies are being affected.\n\nPolitical rhetoric and policies that target specific immigrant groups could also be contributing to an increase in preterm births (babies born before 37 weeks of gestation) among Latinas, according to a study released by Harvard University\u2019s Chan School of Public Health in October.\n\nUsing population information from New York City, researchers found that preterm births among Latinas rose from 7.7 percent before Trump became a presidential nominee to 8.2 percent after his inauguration. Preterm births among Latinas born in Mexico and Central America rose even more during that same period, increasing from 7.3 percent to 8.4 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important here is that this is affecting not only the mothers but the next generation, because when you\u2019re born premature, it increases the risk of infant death, it increases the risk of infant illness and it increases the risk of different kinds of diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, when you get older,\u201d Dr. Nancy Krieger, a professor of social epidemiology and the lead author on the study, previously told HuffPost.\n\nAnother study, published in 2017, examined birth weights in Iowa before and after a 2008 immigration raid in Postville \u2015 one of the largest single-site federal immigration raids in U.S. history. Researchers found that after the raid, babies born to Latina mothers, regardless of immigration status, were at a higher risk of low birth weight compared to the same period a year earlier. Babies born to white mothers did not suffer the same effect.\n\nLanguage matters. Policy matters more.\n\nFear, force and toxic rhetoric are having measurable negative impacts on Latinos living in the U.S. \u2014 and anti-immigrant hostility doesn\u2019t seem likely to decrease any time soon."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely. As he sheds advisers at a head-spinning rate, he reaches out to old associates, complaining that few of the people around him were there at the beginning."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Government Shutdown to Continue for Days as Senate Adjourns Until Thursday", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/us/politics/shutdown-trump-senate.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-23 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "In South Texas on Saturday morning, work by border security officials appeared to continue as usual despite the shutdown.

In broad terms, \u201c\u2019omics\u201d refers to the identification and study of molecules related to different biological processes and how they work together. Genomics, for example, looks at molecules related to the operations of genes; metabolomics at those involved in our metabolisms, and so on.\n\nBut one of the more compelling \u2019omics fields is proteomics, because it focuses on proteins, which are expressed by genes and subsequently jump-start countless other physiological processes throughout our bodies.\n\nProteins are at the heart of our busy interior biology.\n\nBut almost nothing has been known about the proteomics of people who exercise and whether and how they might differ from those of people who rarely move and what it might mean if they do.\n\nSo, for the new study, which was published in November in the Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, set out to look at various people\u2019s proteins.\n\nThey first gathered 31 healthy young men and women, about half of whom exercised regularly, while the rest did not. They also recruited an additional group of 16 healthy middle-aged and older men, half of whom were physically active and half of whom were sedentary."}]
