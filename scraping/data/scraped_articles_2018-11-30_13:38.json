Together with her husband and newborn son she takes stock of the painful week she's had. It's a regular conversation for many French Jews.\n\nMyriam, who did not want to give her last name over fears for her own safety, questions whether France is a country where her family can prosper, a place they can still call home.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Agency for Israel, 55,000 French Jews have left the country since the year 2000.\n\n\"I'm scared of the future of my baby here,\" Myriam told CNN.\n\n\"I hope that he will have a future here, and you know Jewish communities are a part of the history of France.\"\n\nMyriam's family gather for Shabbat dinner in a Paris suburb.\n\nEarlier this month, the French government said that anti-Semitic acts had increased by 69% over the first nine months of 2018. The new statistics coincided with the announcement of a 5 million euro government fund to combat anti-Semitism in schools and a pledge to tackle online hate speech.\n\nFrederic Potier, the man charged with leading the government's plans to tackle anti-Semitism, said the poll's findings were shocking.\n\n\"I'm really surprised by this number because in our country... 20% is a lot,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN as to why the number was so high, he answered: \"I will not say that we don't have any problems, yes we do. We have some problems, some teachers have difficulties to teach the Holocaust.\"\n\n20% of 18- to 34-year-olds polled have never heard of the Holocaust in France Source: CNN/ComRes poll 2018\n\nArthur Reverchon, a history teacher who works with children in Paris, says Holocaust education is a large part of the program in secondary schools and often comes up in exams.\n\n\"The history curriculum taught to kids between the ages of 11-13 deals largely with the birth of Judaism. With regards to anti-Semitism in France, the Dreyfus affair is on the curriculum in middle school (13-14) and in high school (16-17), this allows us to delve into the issue of anti-Semitism in France and in Europe. The Holocaust constitutes a large part of the program in secondary school.\"\n\n\"On the whole, I think the Holocaust is well taught in the curriculum and it's wrong to say it's difficult to teach the Holocaust in French schools, particularly in the suburbs,\" Reverchon told CNN.\n\n\"I taught in three different schools, all three were difficult and in the suburbs, but I never had any difficulty teaching the Holocaust, my students were always receptive. If there are examples, and I'm not denying their existence, they are globally isolated events.\"\n\nViolent attacks\n\nSince 2006, when Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish man, was kidnapped and killed, 11 people have died in anti-Semitic attacks in France.\n\nIn 2017, Sarah Halimi, a 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman, was murdered in her apartment, dragged from her bed and thrown from the balcony in an anti-Semitic attack which shocked the nation.\n\nEarlier this year, hundreds took to the streets to protest after Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Holocaust survivor, was slain in her apartment in what French authorities have described as an anti-Semitic hate crime.\n\nAn undated photograph of Mireille Knoll (R), provided to CNN by her granddaughter Jessica Knoll (L).\n\nThat list of fatal attacks almost included Nathaniel Azoulay, an 18-year-old Parisian who told CNN how he was attacked by a man wielding a saw after a traffic altercation. Azoulay says the man had been civil toward him initially.\n\n\"He was talking to me normally, but at some point, his speech changed when he saw the kippah,\" said Azoulay, referring to his head covering.\n\nThe man's aggression prompted Azoulay and his brother to flee their car, running as fast as they could toward safety. Though both trained in Krav Maga, the self-defense system used by the Israel Defense Forces and taught in Jewish community centers in France, neither could escape the assailant.\n\n\"He started hurling anti-Semitic insults, 'f***king Jew, you're gonna die on this road,'\" said Azoulay. \"He wanted us to die... he stabbed my brother with the saw and my brother could not protect himself with his Krav Maga moves.\"\n\nAzoulay says he tried to save his brother, who had been pushed to the floor with the saw aimed at his neck, but a group of the attacker's friends arrived and surrounded the siblings.\n\n\"The attacker was shouting: 'They're f***ing Jews we can beat up, come, hit them,'\" said Azoulay.\n\n\"We tried to run back to the car. He attacked me again with the saw on my back but I had a big jacket. His friends were going towards my brother and pushing him on the ground. I managed to grab the saw. I grabbed the sharp side so it cut my fingers and I had to get it stitched up at the hospital.\"\n\nAzoulay says the attack came to a halt only after the father of the attacker pleaded with his son to stop.\n\nAzoulay's brother was injured in the attack and police investigated. But a trial has yet to begin.\n\nThe relationship between the two communities has deteriorated steadily as the politics of the Middle East has reverberated in France.\n\nIt's visible in the working-class Parisian suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, which once had a thriving Jewish community.\n\nThe community center and synagogue were once full. But a member of the community told CNN the numbers have dropped dramatically.\n\nFear has forced many to leave for other parts of Paris or in some cases, leave the country altogether.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN poll reveals anti-Semitism is alive and well in Europe Replay More Videos ...

They have nothing to do with what's going on in Palestine. They are afraid for their children and that's crazy.\"\n\nThe turning point\n\nYonathan Arfi, vice president of CRIF, an umbrella body for Jewish groups in France, says there have been \"several hundred attacks\" since 2000, with the nature of those attacks changing markedly.\n\nHe cites the start of the second intifada in the West Bank and Gaza in 2000 as the moment the attacks on the Jewish community began to change.\n\n\"Before it was graffiti on buildings, now it ends up with (the) killing of people and terrorism, so we see that the nature of anti-Semitism has changed dramatically,\" said Arfi.\n\n\"These attacks were committed by young people identifying with Palestinians considering Jews guilty of the things happening in the Middle East, I would say.\"\n\nWhile traditional anti-Semitism is not a new phenomenon in France, the government is battling against what has been coined as the \"new anti-Semitism,\" which it says spills out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nPotier says there is a divergence between both the \"old\" and \"new\" strains of anti-Semitism, which are equally destructive.\n\n\"What we call in France the new anti-Semitism is coming from radical Muslims, but as I say every day, the new anti-Semitism uses very old messages like the Protocol of the Elders of Zion, the theory that Jews have money and power,\" Potier said. \"... both are completely linked. There is a common point between the far-right and radical Muslims.\n\n\"When you are talking about Jews and money for instance, it is the same clich\u00e9, it is the same stereotypes that are being used by these groups. So, when you are educating people, about religious beliefs, what is Israel, what is Zionism, you are using the same tools.\"\n\nHakim El Karoui, a senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne who has previously worked for the French Ministry for Economy and Finance and has advised the government on anti-Semitism, says the lack of familiarity between the two communities is a huge factor in creating tension.\n\nIncreasing segregation between the communities is a dangerous reality that is leading to even less interaction and understanding between communities, often prompting more tension, he says.\n\n\"What has happened in a lot of working-class neighborhoods is that where Arab and Jews once lived together, the Jews have left,\" El Karoui told CNN.\n\n\"They (the Jewish community) left Seine-Saint-Denis, they went to the west side of Paris and therefore they don't know each other anymore,\" El Karoui said.\n\n\"I'm pretty worried about the deterioration of the situation and I think the best answer to this issue should obviously be coming from the government but also from the Muslim community.\n\n\"It needs to say out loud: 'You have no right to say this.' It needs to say, 'You are wrong. You are making a mistake by saying this because in the end your words will come back against you.' The fact that there's a lot of silence on this topic is a problem.\"\n\nThe government hopes its new plan can begin to tackle the roots of anti-Semitism within France.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the mobilization of a national team tasked with educating children in schools across the country on the dangers of anti-Semitism.\n\nHe also promised to make tackling online hate speech a national priority, as well as introducing an anti-racism prize named after Halimi, a 23-year-old tortured and murdered in an anti-Semitic attack in 2006.

Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia,\" Sanders said, even as she insisted Trump's meeting with Putin was canceled because of Russia's seizure of Ukrainian Navy ships and sailors earlier this week. Trump also said the situation in Ukraine was his \"sole reason\" for scrapping the meeting.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman told Russian state media earlier Friday that Trump and Putin would have a \"brief impromptu meeting\" on the sidelines of the G20. Though the two leaders are likely to see each other and shake hands alongside other leaders at the international summit, a White House official said no meeting had been rescheduled between the two leaders.\n\nThe official said the Kremlin appeared to be \"trying to save face\" with the Friday morning statement.\n\nTrump arrived in Buenos Aires for the summit late Thursday night, marking the first time he has set foot in Latin America in his nearly two years in office and kicking off what promises to be a whirlwind 48-hour visit . Friday will amount to the President's busiest day of diplomacy, but his most important meeting of the summit -- his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- doesn't come until a day later.\n\nTrump's aides hoped a signing ceremony for the recently struck United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would act as a centerpiece of the trip. At the Friday morning event, Trump hailed the revised NAFTA free trade deal, rebranded as the USMCA, as a \"truly groundbreaking achievement\" alongside his Canadian and Mexican counterparts.\n\nPersistent disputes with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- including over US steel and aluminum tariffs -- led to questions about who precisely from the Canadian side would be doing the signing, but Trudeau stood next to Trump and touted the deal as a success for middle class workers. Still, he pressed Trump during the event to remove steel and aluminum tariffs imposed earlier this year.\n\nTrump has hailed the agreement as evidence of his negotiating prowess and said the pact would benefit American workers. He's been unnerved in recent days by a shaky stock market and factory closures by General Motors, according to people familiar with the matter, and is hoping to be able to tout the new trade agreement in Argentina.\n\nAggressive schedule\n\nTrump was darting from bilateral meetings to summit sessions and back, starting with an early morning breakfast alongside Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the summit's host. Trump has known Macri for decades, beginning when both were real estate developers.\n\n\"I want to just say I've been friends with Mauricio for a long time, many years,\" Trump said at the Casa Rosada, the presidential mansion. \"He was a young man, a handsome man.\"\n\nTrump recollected a deal with Macri's family to develop the West Side railroad yards -- one of the \"largest jobs in Manhattan,\" in Trump's telling.\n\n\"That was in my civilian days,\" Trump said. \"Little did you realize I would become president.\"\n\nTrump said in their meeting, he'd discuss trade and military purchases with the Argentine president.\n\nFrom there, Trump joined the large gathering of G20 leaders, finding himself face-to-face with the collection of global leaders he has sometimes rebuffed.\n\nThe gathering of leaders also gave way to a brief encounter with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the first time Trump has met with the crown prince in person since the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nTrump \"exchanged pleasantries\" with bin Salman, a White House official said. Asked about the encounter, Trump said he and the crown prince \"had no discussion.\"\n\n\"We might, but we had none,\" he said.\n\nWhite most of the world has castigated bin Salman, Trump has taken the opposite approach, indicating he has no plans to cut ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA pull-aside chat is scheduled with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose government has pushed for greater punishment of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's killing, which occurred at a consulate in Istanbul. Trump is also slated to speak on the sidelines with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has acted as an avid cheerleader for Trump's diplomatic opening with North Korea.\n\nLess enthusiastic has been Japanese President Shinzo Abe, who's expressed concern about easing pressure on Pyongyang without any corresponding steps from the North Korean regime.\n\nAbe also offered hyperbolic praise as he sat before the cameras alongside his US counterpart, congratulating Trump \"on your historic victory in the midterm elections in the United States.\"\n\nWhile Trump has touted the midterm election results in such terms, the midterm election results amounted to a stinging rebuke of Trump as Democrats picked up nearly 40 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump was supposed to sit later in the day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted last year's G20 and has withstood sustained attacks by Trump over auto imports and trade. But Merkel's government plane suffered technical problems en route, and she was forced to turn back to Cologne. She was expected to arrive late to the summit, and the meeting did not appear on Trump's schedule for Friday.\n\nMerkel recently announced that she will not run for another term as chancellor after acting as Europe's de facto leader for more than a decade.\n\nG20 members are also bracing for US intransigence as the leaders work to release a final joint communique from the assembled leaders -- a Trump administration position that has hampered efforts to release communiques at past summits.\n\nA source familiar with discussions said US national security adviser John Bolton has positioned the US's stance on the communique's language as a take-it-or-leave-it offer.\n\nA White House official said the US is \"committed to working toward consensus on the communique but will stand firm against language that prejudices US positions and is willing to walk away if necessary.\"\n\nThe official said the US is leaving some room for compromise, but has made clear that there are certain positions regarding the communique that are non-negotiable. At least \"not right now,\" the official said.\n\nUltimately, a decision on the communique will come down to the President himself -- and his willingness to compromise versus being cast as the odd man out.\n\nMueller cloud remains\n\nJUST WATCHED Does Cohen plea reveal legal exposure for Trump children?

The President has publicly and privately groused that he thinks the investigation has hampered his diplomatic efforts on the world stage.\n\nTrump's second foreign trip, in July 2017, became another key moment in the Mueller investigation as the President and his aides worked to craft a statement on behalf of his eldest son concerning the now-infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower a year prior. A year later, as the President prepared to fly to Helsinki to meet with Putin, the Justice Department announced the indictment of Russian intelligence officers linked to election interference.\n\nThe Cohen plea agreement on Thursday became the latest example, and soon after the news emerged Trump moved to scrap his meeting with Putin. The White House said Trump had decided to cancel the get-together following a meeting with his top foreign policy advisers after boarding Air Force One, even though no new information had publicly emerged.\n\nScrapping the meeting with Putin, though, did not eliminate all of the President's flair for make-or-break drama. He is still scheduled to join Xi, the Chinese President, for a working dinner on Saturday to hash out a possible ceasefire to the trade war that has roiled their countries and threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy if the ratcheting-up persists.\n\nLeaving the White House on Thursday, Trump kept the global suspense going.\n\n\"I think we're very close to doing something with China, but I don't know that I want to do it, because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. So I really don't know,\" the President said before departing Washington. \"But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to making a deal. But, frankly, I like the deal we have right now.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Japan may be about to upset Asia's balance of power", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/xVdNbIU8xbc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:23", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Japan is preparing an order for roughly 100 US-designed F-35 stealth fighter jets in a deal that could potentially upend the balance of power in Asia, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nThat order would include a version of the jet that can take-off and land vertically, a feature that could prompt Japan to transform some of its existing ships into aircraft carriers so that it can operate the fighters at sea -- a capability they have not had since World War II, a source close to the F-35 program told CNN.\n\n\"With short take-off vertical landing capability you are now able to operate at sea.

When you see great focus on the F-35 from Japan I think that is the result of the very strong US-Japan military partnership,\" the source told CNN.\n\n'Push the front line of maritime engagement'\n\nSources said the new Japanese-US deal would include two of the three F-35 variants, the A and B models. The third, the F-35C, is designed for use on the US Navy's largest aircraft carriers.\n\nF-35As, of which Japan already has 10 in its fleet, with 32 more on an preexisting order, are conventional jets, using a runway to take off and land.\n\nF-35Bs are short take-off and vertical landing capable, meaning they can use smaller airports or operate from flattop warships. The US Marine Corps flies F-35Bs off US Navy amphibious assault ships, sometimes called baby aircraft carriers as they are about half the size of the US Navy's Nimitz-class carriers.\n\nJapan's Maritime Self Defense Force possesses two of these type of ships, the Izumo and its sister ship, the Kaga, each one is capable of carrying 14 helicopters and would need to be refitted to accommodate the F-35Bs aircraft.\n\nThe Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ship JS Izumo sails the South China Sea with the US guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey.\n\nWhile the main role of Japan's military remains defense of its home islands, \"this could push the front line of maritime engagement further out than before,\" said Corey Wallace, Asia security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, said of Japan's possible acquisition of F-35Bs.\n\n\"Will it bother China? Probably, but only in so far that it further complicates the projection of Chinese military power into the southwestern maritime domain around Japan's Ryukyu islands,\" Wallace said.\n\nAn article published in the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper, Wednesday, said the refit of the Izumo-class ships, and the purchase of the F-35Bs, \"essentially changes the warships' nature from a defensive to offensive one.\"\n\nThe story continued: \"Japan must not forget its infamous history of invading countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region during WWII.\"\n\nChina's own answer to the F-35, the domestically built twin-engine J-20 stealth jet, entered the People's Liberation Army Air Force fleet in February. It is unknown how many J-20's China has in operation in its fleet at present.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and now Hawaii Pacific University professor, said the F-35Bs on a Japanese warship \"add a new dimension\" and \"a deterrent factor\" to the security situation in the Pacific.\n\nBut Schuster said a refitted Japanese carrier would likely only carry six to eight F-35Bs, compared to as many as two dozen jets that will be on Chinese carriers now in sea trials or production.\n\nSchuster also cautions that it could be three or four years until newly ordered F-35s reach the Japanese fleet, unless Tokyo's orders are given priority over other buyers of the plane.\n\nThe Japanese Air Self-Defense Force maintainers pose for a photo during the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nTwelve nations besides Japan and the US are in the F-35 program, with two of those -- Australia and South Korea -- in the Pacific region, according to Lockheed Martin, which builds the plane.\n\nJapan does enjoy the advantage of being one of three final assembly points for the F-35, the others being in Texas and Italy.\n\nAnd it's the F-35 commonality between Japan, the US and their allies that brings strength in numbers but also understanding.\n\nWallace said the future could conceivably have US F-35s operating from Japanese ships and or Japanese F-35s flying off American ones.\n\nOne of the other two nations to operate the F-35B, the United Kingdom, has had US versions of the jet operating off its HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier.\n\nBut Wallace also warned not to overemphasize the importance of a Japanese carrier.\n\n\"This singular new carrier won't carry enough planes, or be able to launch jets with enough ordnance to conduct strike, or bombing missions in any way that will truly threaten China's mainland, given how strong China's own defenses are,\" he said.\n\nWhat F-35Bs will do is increase the options available to Japanese defense planners.\n\n\"The F-35B can operate from modified runways or make-shift airfields thereby giving Japan's Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) more options to operate from smaller, more distant Japanese islands in a pinch. This is quite important for survivability and response if the major airbases are put out of commission in a saturation missile attack,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Congo Ebola outbreak is 2nd largest, 2nd deadliest", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/VRum2yJvd38/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:24", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- with 426 total cases, including 245 deaths -- is now the second largest and second deadliest in history, according to Thursday's report from the nation's Ministry of Health.\n\nA 2000-01 outbreak in Uganda included 425 cases and caused 224 deaths, according to the World Health Organization . The deadliest outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\n\"This is a milestone nobody wanted to hit,\" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic wrote in an email. On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but case fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.\n\nOf the total cases, 379 have been confirmed, and 47 are probable, according to the ministry. An additional 87 suspected cases are under investigation.\n\nOn a positive note, 126 patients have recovered, the ministry said.\n\nThis is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the second this year.\n\nneighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. North Kivu province , which includes the cities Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported inneighboring Ituri province, according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\n\"The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high,\" WHO said in a statement Thursday\n\nHowever, there have been no confirmed cases in Congo's neighbors, Jasarevic said. \"All neighboring countries have implemented heightened surveillance and are detecting and investigating alerts and suspected Ebola cases.\"\n\nCases continue to mushroom\n\nRecent spread of the infection to people in Butembo, a city that's home to 1.2 million, \"raised concerns,\" wrote Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, and his co-authors in an editorial published online Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSeeing \"gaps in the response,\" Gostin and his co-authors recommend that the United States and allies \"mobilize high-level political attention and resources for the Ebola response\" and \"develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu.\"\n\nIn October, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel who had been stationed in Congo had been pulled back from the worst affected areas due to safety concerns, a US government official familiar with the situation said at the time\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\nA senior White House official confirmed this month that US government personnel who had been working on the ground in Beni had been evacuated to other parts of Congo due to safety concerns. The official said that the situation is being evaluated constantly and that in the meantime, the US continues to provide technical and financial assistance to contain the outbreak.\n\nJasarevic described the overall environment as \"complex and challenging.\"\n\n\"On Friday, 16 November, a second attack in one week occurred in Beni,\" he reported. \"UN peacekeepers and government forces engaged with rebel forces. By Sunday, November 18 all activities in Beni were re-launched, including vaccination.\"\n\nJasarevic says the response in areas outside Beni has not been affected by conflict, but WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola.\n\nDespite such risks and safety concerns, Congo's response effort has been robust. The Ministry of Health has 900 people active in the response, according to Jasarevic, and of these, 85% are from the local area. Additionally, WHO has deployed 300 of its own staff to the region.\n\nThe latest minstry report indicates that 37,559 people have received an experimental vaccine in a campaign that began August 8. \"This includes over 11,100 health and frontline workers, and 9,300 children,\" Jasarevic said.\n\nThe experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGostin and his co-authors are doubtful. \"Despite deploying an experimental vaccine, cases doubled in October 2018,\" they wrote. More generally, they believe that the overall response, which also includes contact tracing and investigational treatments, may not be adequate.\n\n'Cascading transmission' of the disease\n\n\"Of 137 confirmed cases between October 28 and November 26, only 19 were found through contact tracing, 32 were on contact lists but lost to follow-up, and 83 (61%) had no known links to confirmed cases,\" Gostin and his co-authors wrote. \"These data suggest contact tracing and vaccination have not prevented cascading transmission.\"\n\nGostin also believes that \"community distrust is deep after decades-long humanitarian crises, impeding information-sharing and cooperation.\" They note that WHO and UN pledged enhanced security operations this month, \"yet lethal attacks have persisted.\"\n\nNora Love, field director for the International Rescue Committee's operations in the region, offers a more nuanced view.\n\nFrom mid-September through the end of last week, the nonprofit humanitarian group has trained over 730 health care workers who staff the dozens of health care facilities between the group's two field offices in Beni and Butembo.\n\n\"It's a very lush green area that rains every day, and the temperatures are pretty nice, but it's definitely a city at the edge of a country, and you can see that it also has been under conflict. There's definitely a tension within the communities here,\" Love said. \"You know that you're in a conflict area. There's always some sort of insecurity happening every single day.\"\n\nDespite this, she does not feel \"unwelcome here from the community,\" she said, and she does not feel under threat because she works within health facilities, \"which are a little bit more isolated than going to a village.\"\n\nGetting ahead of an infectious disease\n\n\"The people who are doing the safe burials have been the most exposed and the most vulnerable because people are very emotional after they lost a loved one,\" Love said. \"And the protocols for safe burial are different than the traditional burials here, and that causes some distress within the community.\"\n\nTraditional burials involve touching the body of the deceased. To prevent spread of the infectious disease, safe burials require protective equipment and sanitizing the family's environment.\n\nStill, Love has witnessed \"violent reactions\" at hospitals and health facilities when deaths occur. Patients have been forcefully removed from the hospital by their loved ones, she said.\n\n\"Last week, they went to a hospital when somebody died, and they did vandalism and burned some things,\" Love said. \"Luckily, so far, no health workers have been harmed by this, but there's always a watching and being aware that it could flare up.\"\n\nViolence is not the only challenge, as Beni has recently experienced a \"significant increase\" in the number of malaria cases, according to a recent report from the Ministry of Health.\n\nLove's main frustration has been the difficulty of getting \"ahead of things. Just when we feel we've made strides in one location, then the outbreak has moved somewhere else,\" she said. As a result, her organization has been exploring new strategies to see whether it can become more flexible and more rapid in its response.\n\nMeanwhile, the larger response persists. Health care workers continue with vaccination efforts as WHO along with Congo conducts its first randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the experimental drugs offered under \"compassionate use\" to treat Ebola patients.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWHO said it remains \"focused on the ongoing containment efforts to end the outbreak\" and recommends that neighboring provinces and countries \"enhance surveillance and preparedness activities.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure that the international community does have its eyes on it and not just the UN,\" Love said.\n\nJasarevic remains hopeful: \"We are confident that working together with all our partners, we can and will end it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Australian school children defy prime minister with climate strike", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/9vpri4P2xrE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:25", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thousands of Australian children skipped school on Friday in defiance of the prime minister to protest for greater action on climate change.\n\nOrganizers estimated around 15,000 left their classrooms in 30 locations across the country, including Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, carrying signs reading \"procrastinating is our job not yours\" and \"I've seen smarter Cabinets at Ikea\".\n\nFriday's protests followed similar protests in Canberra and Hobart earlier this week.\n\nAs the children prepared for three days of protest, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament \"what we want is more learning in schools and less activism.\"\n\nThis rally has the best signs of all time \ud83d\ude02 #ClimateStrike #auspol pic.twitter.com/OiadhbiXwf\n\nTwo Central Victoria pupils, inspired by Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old student in Sweden who staged her own climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament in September, started the \"Strike 4 Climate Action.\"\n\nHarriet O'Shea Carre and Milou Albrecht, both 14, penned a call to arms asking fellow school children to join them in protest, stating: \"Just going to school isn't doing anything about climate change.

He has not directly contradicted Trump's fervent denials of collusion between his campaign and Moscow.\n\nFurthermore, it is not known whether Mueller has documentary evidence to implicate the President in any wrongdoing, or is simply relying on Cohen's testimony. Many legal experts doubt he would wager on a witness like Cohen, who has admitted lying, without supporting evidence.\n\nBut there is no clear indication that Trump broke the law. And, despite Thursday's developments, there is no sign that a political situation in Washington that still makes impeachment an unlikely prospect has changed.\n\nTrump, just after landing in Buenos Aires for the G20, showed that the investigation was still on his mind despite the upcoming conference.\n\n\"This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately,\" the President tweeted late Thursday.\n\nBut Thursday's developments must also be seen in the context of Mueller's work so far.\n\nIn a series of indictments, he has built a picture of a sophisticated Russian hacking operation, an attempt to infect America's political dialogue with lies and distraction on social media and indicted and convicted a number of Trump associates and advisers over lying to his investigation.\n\nHe may now be trying to establish that Trump and those around him were well aware of Russia's activity despite their vehement claims there was no collusion.\n\nSome observers believe that the rich detail in Mueller's legal filings is one way of painting a picture of Russian interference and the behavior of Trump world in case the President finds some way to block his eventual final report.\n\nThere are immediate and longer term political and legal consequences from Cohen throwing himself firmly in Mueller's camp.\n\nHis claims, made under oath and with the certainty of a long jail sentence if he is being untruthful, directly contradict Trump's assurances that he has had no deals or business relationships with Russia.\n\nIf that is the case, Trump has brazenly lied to the American people.\n\nIn another damaging blow, Cohen said he lied for political reasons.\n\n\"I made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1's political messaging and to be loyal to Individual-1,\" Cohen said in a document filed with the court, referring to the President.\n\nHis statement raises another question not answered in the document.\n\nDid the President know that Cohen was lying to Congress, or did he coerce him to do so? If he did, such a move would surely rise to the level of the kind of abuse of power that would be part of any articles of impeachment.\n\nThe President slammed Cohen as \"weak\" on Thursday and said he was lying to Mueller to spare himself a long jail sentence after admitting to tax and financial fraud. He made the remarks to reporters before heading off to the G20 summit in Argentina, in an unsolicited statement that appeared to show his unease.\n\nTrump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani also blasted Cohen.\n\nAnd he tried to scotch a question that buzzed around Washington immediately after the Cohen news: Did Trump tell a different story about his hopes of building a Trump tower in Moscow in written answers to the special counsel than what Cohen has testified, a version of events Mueller clearly believes?\n\nGiuliani said that there was \"no contradiction\" between Trump's responses to Mueller and Cohen. And he suggested that by waiting to move on Cohen until the President turned over his answers to his questions in recent days, he might have been setting a trap.\n\n\"Their sneakiness didn't work if that's what they were trying to do,\" Giuliani said.\n\nTrump's defense may have backfired\n\nYet Trump's own self-defense raised another question that could weaken his position and cause trouble for his legal team.\n\nHe said that he was justified in seeking business opportunities in Russia while running for President because he might not have reached the White House and should not therefore be penalized by losing a chance to make money.\n\n\"There would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gone back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\"\n\nTrump's comment left the impression he was using his platform as a presidential candidate as a vehicle to enrich himself rather than to serve the American people.\n\nMore troublingly, the possibility that he could be seeking favorable treatment from Russia could offer a motivation for a change made to water down a hostile stance towards Russia in the platform at the Republican National Convention.\n\nAnd the fact that he lied about not having business links with Russia after pursuing the deal offered Moscow leverage over him when he became President, opening the possibility of a serious national security threat if he was viewed as compromised.\n\nTrump might have also undermined a possible avenue of defense, that Cohen was the primary actor in the search for a Trump Tower Moscow deal, when he said: \"I decided not to do the project, so I didn't do it. \"\n\nSome Trump supporters warned against irresponsibly jumping to conclusions and questioned Cohen's credibility.\n\n\"The sky is falling all of a sudden because there is another plea deal. Who knows how this is going to play out in terms of the credibility of Michael Cohen,\" said Jim Schultz, a former Trump White House lawyer on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nThe White House was braced for some kind of Cohen bombshell ever since he appeared in Washington to meet Mueller's prosecutors earlier this month.\n\nWhat must most worry them now, and other people close to Trump who could be implicated by the Russia organization, is what he has said in consultations that have now stretched over three full days."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Paul Manafort sentencing planned for March in DC case", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/5AujMkba_cQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:30", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's office is considering bringing more criminal charges against Paul Manafort, after it accused the former Trump campaign chairman of violating his plea deal to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nThe announcement came at a half-hour court hearing Friday morning, where Manafort's team learned that his sentencing for conspiracy and witness tampering will happen on March 5, 2019.\n\nThe hearing came just days after special counsel prosecutors said they believe Manafort lied during his interviews with investigators following his guilty plea in September. The special counsel's office may have to turn over evidence backing up its claim in the coming weeks.\n\nSuch a move could give Manafort's legal team, and in theory, President Donald Trump's lawyers if they are still in touch, a new window into some of the information Mueller has collected during the investigation.\n\nManafort pleaded guilty earlier this year to two charges of conspiracy and witness tampering, while publicly admitting he committed several other financial and lobbying crimes. He separately was found guilty by a jury in Virginia of eight financial fraud charges related to his Ukrainian lobbying proceeds.\n\nLead prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said the Justice Department is evaluating whether Manafort could still be held liable for crimes he's admitted to but is not currently charged with in federal court.\n\n\"I don't know at this time. We will have to evaluate whether it will be fruitful to take action\" on those crimes, Weissmann said.\n\nManafort is currently in jail in Alexandria, Virginia. He did not attend the hearing Friday; two defense attorneys were there on his behalf.\n\nSince his initial indictment last October, Manafort has been a thorn for prosecutors and, at times, for the judge.\n\nWhile he still claimed his innocence in the case, prosecutors indicted him for attempting to contact potential witnesses to shape their stories. He then went to trial in Virginia federal court, holding off prosecutors from making a deal. After he lost his case at trial, Manafort changed his plea and agreed to cooperate with investigators. But that cooperation now appears to be tainted with the lying accusation -- another unusual turn of events.\n\nManafort says he believes he was truthful with investigators.\n\n\"We have ... had lengthy conversations with the defense to discuss the facts,\" related to Manafort's alleged lies during his cooperation, Weissmann said. \"They're aware the gravemen of what the concerns are.\"\n\nBoth legal teams will hash that out in court soon, with filings beginning to come in next week about the facts of how Manafort's cooperation fell apart.\n\nDespite the dispute over whether Manafort breached his plea deal, the two parties struck a cordial tone in the courtroom.\n\nWhen things wrapped up, lawyers from both sides wished each other \"happy holidays,\" sometimes shouting across the room, as people started filing out of the chilly courtroom.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin: I think Trump might not finish term Replay More Videos ...

But instead, it was a hashing out of plans and procedures that set up clashes between the attorneys for the coming months.\n\nAmy Berman Jackson of the US District Court has been a harsh critic so far of Manafort's legal maneuvers. She reprimanded his work ghost-writing an op-ed for a Ukrainian newspaper about himself after his arrest, and she denied every request he made to challenge the legal underpinnings of his indictment and Mueller's approach. She also revoked his house arrest in June, sending him to jail because of the witness tampering accusation.\n\nJackson has also taken issue more than once with Manafort's lead attorney, Kevin Downing, after he grew impassioned during court proceedings and raised his voice\n\nShe placed a gag order on the case in its early days after Downing spoke to cameras outside the courtroom defending Manafort and President Donald Trump. Jackson has repeatedly warned Manafort's lawyers and Manafort that they should not play politics, especially in the media, as a way to influence the case.\n\n\"Other people can talk about the case ... but when those events become orchestrated or entangled, that's where the risk is of crossing the line,\" Jackson said at a hearing for Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates earlier this year, while they both still sought jury trials.\n\nDowning took another unusual step in recent months -- of communicating with the President's legal team about Manafort's cooperation sessions, according to the President's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Trump has said recently a pardon for Manafort is not \"off the table,\" raising questions about whether Trump telegraphed to Manafort to end his cooperation.\n\nProsecutors simply said earlier this week that Manafort \"breached\" his agreement by lying \"on a variety of subject matters.\" They said they would give the judge more details at a later date, before his sentencing.\n\nJackson did note that the March sentencing date could be moved back as well.\n\nIf Jackson agrees that he broke his deal, Manafort's likely sentence in the DC case could be between 17 and almost 22 years in prison, according to his plea agreement. Prosecutors said they will decide at a later time whether they believe that sentence range should be reduced or increased. \"We're still debating what the consequences will be,\" Weissmann said.\n\nManafort will be sentenced separately on February 8 for his convictions in Virginia."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Donald Trump Jr., Trump Org. in spotlight after Cohen plea", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GwXYVFJZYt0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:31", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Michael Cohen's admission that he lied to Congress about Donald Trump's knowledge of the ongoing effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign has ensnared the President's children in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nAfter previously saying that the Moscow project had stopped in January 2016, just before the Iowa caucuses, Cohen said Thursday in federal court that discussions actually continued until June 2016 -- when Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nCohen, in accepting a plea deal, admitted that he had \"more extensive communications\" than the three he previously indicated he had with Trump, which he previously claimed lasted no more than a few minutes, and added that he \"briefed\" Trump family members about the project. The guilty plea doesn't state which family members Cohen is referring to or when he spoke with them. It would not be illegal to discuss the plans with Trump's children, who were helping steer the business.\n\nAt least one of Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., a loyal surrogate for his father on the campaign trail, has provided testimony under oath to at least three congressional committees where he was asked about the proposed deal. Most of that testimony is not public and it isn't clear how detailed the questions were about the project. Yet it could place him in legal jeopardy if anything he told Congress conflicts with information provided by Cohen if it is supported by other evidence.\n\nA person close to the company tells CNN that Trump Jr. did know about the project as did his sister, Ivanka, whose involvement was limited to recommending architects and designers. The source says Trump Jr.'s testimony that his knowledge was \"peripheral\" is \"100% accurate.\"\n\nThe source added that the Trump Organization found one email involving Trump Jr. and a few that included Ivanka, but said all of those communications were sent before January 2016.\n\nOne House panel said in a footnote to a report that Trump Jr. told them he believed the Moscow project was dormant as of early June 2016. But it was not clear the context of what Trump Jr. was asked or exactly how he answered it.\n\n\"All communications, all document that we have [about] Trump Moscow end by January 2016,\" the source said. The person added, if Cohen continued to work on the project into 2016 \"we weren't aware of it.\"\n\nIt is not clear if Trump Jr. has testified before the special counsel and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nTrump Jr. is already under the spotlight because of his role in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that he agreed to take after being told a Russian lawyer had incriminating information on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe President has previously said an investigation into the Trump Organization, his family's closely-held business, would be a red line for him in terms of his tolerance for the special counsel probe.\n\nFollowing the guilty plea Thursday, Trump called Cohen a liar, saying on the South Lawn of the White House. \" Michael Cohen is lying and he's trying to get a reduced sentence for things that have nothing to do with me,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President defended the deal for a possible Trump real estate venture in Moscow. The project, Trump said, \"lasted a short period of time,\" adding that he decided not to do it because he wanted to focus on running for president. In Cohen's now-discredited testimony, he told lawmakers that he made the decision to terminate the deal on his own without consulting with Trump or any members of the Trump family.\n\nHowever, the President maintained Thursday that \"there would've been nothing wrong if I did do it.\"\n\nThe overlap of Trump's business ties and his political ambitions has been a knotty issue for him since the campaign. He only handed the reins of his business over to his two sons and chief financial officer on the eve of his inauguration, keeping his hand on the steering wheels during the campaign.\n\nTrump kept a firm grip on the business before he took the oath of office in 2017, with key decisions about projects belonging to him and his children Trump Jr, and Ivanka Trump. They were more intimately involved in real estate projects than their younger brother, Eric Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump was often at her father's side and visited projects. She posted a photo of her at a construction site for a project in Azerbaijan on Instagram while both Trump Jr. and his sister attended ribbon cutting ceremonies at project announcements and openings around the globe, from Trump Soho in New York to condo-hotel projects in Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Organization and Trump Jr., did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Ivanka Trump declined to comment.\n\nDiscussions over the Trump Tower Moscow project began in 2015 and by October 28, Trump had signed preliminary agreement that would have brought $4 million in fees to his business to work with a Russian to develop a luxury hotel.\n\nAccording to documents provided to CNN, the project under discussion would have named the hotel spa named after Ivanka Trump. Trump's company was explicitly given the option to \"brand any or all portion of the spa or fitness facilities as 'The Spa by Ivanka Trump' or similar brand,\" according to the document. And if they did name it after Trump's daughter, then Ivanka or her designee would be given \"sole and absolute discretion\" to approve \"all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities,\" the document says.\n\nThe deal never came to fruition.\n\nThe only one of Trump's children who has testified under oath about the Trump Tower Moscow effort in 2015 and 2016 is Trump Jr., who was questioned by several congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the election.\n\nTrump Jr was asked by the House Judiciary Committee if he had any involvement in the potential deal. He responded, under oath, \"Like I said, I was peripherally aware of it, but most of my knowledge has been gained since as it relates to hearing about it over the last few weeks,\" according to a transcript of the interview, which occurred in September 2017, shortly after Cohen publicly revealed details about the Trump Tower Moscow proposal.\n\nHe also testified before the Senate and House Intelligence committees. The House Intelligence panel report released by the Republicans references Trump Jr.'s testimony about the Moscow deal. The report says in a footnote, \"Trump Jr. testified that, as of early June 2016, he believed the Trump Tower Moscow project was dormant.\"\n\nBy contrast, Cohen says he lied when he told lawmakers the deal talks ended in January. The House report does not provide direct quotes from Trump Jr.'s testimony. The Senate has not released any information about Trump Jr.'s testimony.\n\nCohen's guilty plea does not indicate when he briefed the family members about his dealings to get the project off the ground. The source close to the Trump Organization said, \"Michael's modus operandi is to work independently. He doesn't have a great history in including people in the discussion. And on this project, everything that we've seen and all the prep we've done of Don (Jr.) indicates he really knew nothing about this project.\"\n\nAccording to court papers filed Thursday, Cohen spoke with the assistant to Putin's spokesman in January about moving the project forward and possible financing. He also discussed traveling to Moscow in early May 2016 adding that Trump could travel \"once he becomes the nominee after the convention.\"\n\nCohen spoke again in June with a person identified as \"Individual 2\" in Thursday's court filings but known to be Felix Sater, a Russian-American business partner who was involved in other Trump Organization projects in Florida and New York.\n\nBetween June 9 and June 14, 2016, the court papers allege, Sater sent multiple messages to Cohen about traveling, including forms for Cohen to fill out.\n\nCohen met with Sater in the lobby of Trump Tower on June 14, 2016, to tell Sater he wouldn't be traveling.\n\nSater has shared documents with the special counsel's office. He has been a government informant for years stemming from his role in a stock manipulation scheme from the late 1990s. Sater's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump Tower meeting on Clinton\n\nThe Moscow project overlaps with another critical meeting that is of interest to the special counsel's investigation.\n\nOn June 3, a publicist for a Russian pop star reached out to Trump Jr. to arrange a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising incriminating information on presidential rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeveral phone calls, including one to a blocked phone number, followed.\n\nTrump Jr. had several brief phone calls with Emin Agalarov, the son of a Russian real estate magnate, who requested the meeting. Trump Jr. told lawmakers he didn't recall speaking with Emin ahead of the June 9 meeting.\n\nNestled between those calls was one made to a blocked number. Lawmakers have openly suggested Trump Jr. may have called his father on that line. During its investigation, the House Intelligence Committee heard testimony that Trump's primary residence has a blocked phone line.\n\nTrump Jr. told lawmakers \"I have no idea\" who the blocked call was with. When asked if he told his father about the meeting or the underlying offer he said, \"No, I did not.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump and world leaders attend G20 summit", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nR3wiOSBVNk/2SnaKYY", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:32", "body_paragraphs": "Friday's class photo at the G20 included the fewest female heads-of-government than any previous G20 family photo taken since the group began meeting in 2008.\n\nThat was due in part to Angela Merkel's absence (her plane was having issues getting to Argentina).

Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia,\" Sanders said, even as she insisted Trump's meeting with Putin was canceled because of Russia's seizure of Ukrainian Navy ships and sailors earlier this week. Trump also said the situation in Ukraine was his \"sole reason\" for scrapping the meeting.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman told Russian state media earlier Friday that Trump and Putin would have a \"brief impromptu meeting\" on the sidelines of the G20. Though the two leaders are likely to see each other and shake hands alongside other leaders at the international summit, a White House official said no meeting had been rescheduled between the two leaders.\n\nThe official said the Kremlin appeared to be \"trying to save face\" with the Friday morning statement.\n\nTrump arrived in Buenos Aires for the summit late Thursday night, marking the first time he has set foot in Latin America in his nearly two years in office and kicking off what promises to be a whirlwind 48-hour visit . Friday will amount to the President's busiest day of diplomacy, but his most important meeting of the summit -- his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping -- doesn't come until a day later.\n\nTrump's aides hoped a signing ceremony for the recently struck United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would act as a centerpiece of the trip. At the Friday morning event, Trump hailed the revised NAFTA free trade deal, rebranded as the USMCA, as a \"truly groundbreaking achievement\" alongside his Canadian and Mexican counterparts.\n\nPersistent disputes with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- including over US steel and aluminum tariffs -- led to questions about who precisely from the Canadian side would be doing the signing, but Trudeau stood next to Trump and touted the deal as a success for middle class workers. Still, he pressed Trump during the event to remove steel and aluminum tariffs imposed earlier this year.\n\nTrump has hailed the agreement as evidence of his negotiating prowess and said the pact would benefit American workers. He's been unnerved in recent days by a shaky stock market and factory closures by General Motors, according to people familiar with the matter, and is hoping to be able to tout the new trade agreement in Argentina.\n\nAggressive schedule\n\nTrump was darting from bilateral meetings to summit sessions and back, starting with an early morning breakfast alongside Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the summit's host. Trump has known Macri for decades, beginning when both were real estate developers.\n\n\"I want to just say I've been friends with Mauricio for a long time, many years,\" Trump said at the Casa Rosada, the presidential mansion. \"He was a young man, a handsome man.\"\n\nTrump recollected a deal with Macri's family to develop the West Side railroad yards -- one of the \"largest jobs in Manhattan,\" in Trump's telling.\n\n\"That was in my civilian days,\" Trump said. \"Little did you realize I would become president.\"\n\nTrump said in their meeting, he'd discuss trade and military purchases with the Argentine president.\n\nFrom there, Trump joined the large gathering of G20 leaders, finding himself face-to-face with the collection of global leaders he has sometimes rebuffed.\n\nThe gathering of leaders also gave way to a brief encounter with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the first time Trump has met with the crown prince in person since the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\n\nTrump \"exchanged pleasantries\" with bin Salman, a White House official said. Asked about the encounter, Trump said he and the crown prince \"had no discussion.\"\n\n\"We might, but we had none,\" he said.\n\nWhite most of the world has castigated bin Salman, Trump has taken the opposite approach, indicating he has no plans to cut ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA pull-aside chat is scheduled with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose government has pushed for greater punishment of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's killing, which occurred at a consulate in Istanbul. Trump is also slated to speak on the sidelines with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has acted as an avid cheerleader for Trump's diplomatic opening with North Korea.\n\nLess enthusiastic has been Japanese President Shinzo Abe, who's expressed concern about easing pressure on Pyongyang without any corresponding steps from the North Korean regime.\n\nAbe also offered hyperbolic praise as he sat before the cameras alongside his US counterpart, congratulating Trump \"on your historic victory in the midterm elections in the United States.\"\n\nWhile Trump has touted the midterm election results in such terms, the midterm election results amounted to a stinging rebuke of Trump as Democrats picked up nearly 40 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump was supposed to sit later in the day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted last year's G20 and has withstood sustained attacks by Trump over auto imports and trade. But Merkel's government plane suffered technical problems en route, and she was forced to turn back to Cologne. She was expected to arrive late to the summit, and the meeting did not appear on Trump's schedule for Friday.\n\nMerkel recently announced that she will not run for another term as chancellor after acting as Europe's de facto leader for more than a decade.\n\nG20 members are also bracing for US intransigence as the leaders work to release a final joint communique from the assembled leaders -- a Trump administration position that has hampered efforts to release communiques at past summits.\n\nA source familiar with discussions said US national security adviser John Bolton has positioned the US's stance on the communique's language as a take-it-or-leave-it offer.\n\nA White House official said the US is \"committed to working toward consensus on the communique but will stand firm against language that prejudices US positions and is willing to walk away if necessary.\"\n\nThe official said the US is leaving some room for compromise, but has made clear that there are certain positions regarding the communique that are non-negotiable.

MUST WATCH Does Cohen plea reveal legal exposure for Trump children? 07:17\n\nHanging over it all will be the questions sparked by the latest twist in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation -- just the latest instance of the Mueller investigation following Trump outside the United States.\n\nThe President's international trips have been repeatedly marred by developments in the investigation, beginning with Mueller's appointment as special counsel just two days before Trump left for his first international trip. The President has publicly and privately groused that he thinks the investigation has hampered his diplomatic efforts on the world stage.\n\nTrump's second foreign trip, in July 2017, became another key moment in the Mueller investigation as the President and his aides worked to craft a statement on behalf of his eldest son concerning the now-infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower a year prior. A year later, as the President prepared to fly to Helsinki to meet with Putin, the Justice Department announced the indictment of Russian intelligence officers linked to election interference.\n\nThe Cohen plea agreement on Thursday became the latest example, and soon after the news emerged Trump moved to scrap his meeting with Putin. The White House said Trump had decided to cancel the get-together following a meeting with his top foreign policy advisers after boarding Air Force One, even though no new information had publicly emerged.\n\nScrapping the meeting with Putin, though, did not eliminate all of the President's flair for make-or-break drama. He is still scheduled to join Xi, the Chinese President, for a working dinner on Saturday to hash out a possible ceasefire to the trade war that has roiled their countries and threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy if the ratcheting-up persists.\n\nLeaving the White House on Thursday, Trump kept the global suspense going.\n\n\"I think we're very close to doing something with China, but I don't know that I want to do it, because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. So I really don't know,\" the President said before departing Washington. \"But I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I'm open to making a deal.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J. Phillip King, a professor of civil engineering at the University of New Mexico. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate.\n\nThe federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100.\n\nnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToda,y the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration.

Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink.

As he moved a jar to catch a sample, the color changed from clear to brown.\n\n\"When mine comes out, it comes out black,\" Enterprise resident John Tiser said as he watched Edwards work.\n\nTiser, Enterprise's newly appointed water board president, was giving Edwards a tour around this rural community in central Louisiana, where residents have struggled with water problems. He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water.\n\nConcerned about the potential health effects for his family, including his two daughters, he ran for a seat on the local water board.\n\nWhat drives him, Tiser said, is \"being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them.\"\n\nYears of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground, Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them.\n\n\"We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at,\" he said.\n\nIt's what Edwards calls America's \"dirty little secret.\" He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix, leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system.\n\nIn his wife's minivan, complete with acid stains on the carpet, Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations, and slowly being forgotten. \"It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car, because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those. But that van's seen a lot of bad water,\" he said.\n\nEdwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state, and local governments on water quality. His work helped to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nEdwards says Virginia Tech, where he is a professor, supports his work, as long as he can afford to pay for his travel, which he has done for years.\n\nPhotos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Enterprise, Louisiana, resident Jodie Vinson holds a bottle of water from her tap Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Virginia Tech Professor Marc Edwards, left, samples Enterprise's water, which was found to have bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.

But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right?

CNN chose to quote directly from the documents rather than use vague or euphemistic language that fails to convey the violence of the crimes. Reporters were unable to identify and reach most victims because police redacted their names, addresses and other identifying information in the case files. Where police did not redact that information, CNN did, including the full names of suspects who were not charged.\n\nHours after you are raped, you sit in a hospital room, under fluorescent lights, and consent to a forensic exam. Your body is the crime scene. When did it happen, a nurse asks. Where did it happen? Can you tell me who did this to you? The nurse is trained to interview you and search your body for evidence left behind by your attacker. Knowing the details of your assault guides the examination. Did he ejaculate inside of you, on you? Where did he touch you? Did he use any objects? Did he kiss you, lick you? Have you had anything to drink? Did you shower? You\u2019re asked to undress slowly while you stand on a special sheet meant to collect any trace evidence that shakes loose. For three to five hours, the nurse swabs your mouth, your breasts, a bite mark on your neck. She scrapes under your fingernails, combs your pubic hair. She inserts a speculum inside you and drops blue dye on the tissue there to illuminate any places that are torn. The nurse cuts a hair from your head. She takes photographs of your face and shoulders to pair with your chart, of you in the clothes you wore when you were attacked. Every injury is photographed, too \u2014 far away, close-up, with a ruler to show size. When the exam is over, the nurse puts hair, fibers, swabs, vials of blood and urine in a container smaller than a shoebox. She seals it \u2014 your rape kit \u2014 and entrusts it to a police officer. This North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed. Read her full story here: \u2018They treated me like trash.\u2019 Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN This is the way DNA evidence is collected. This is what you endure so police can identify your assailant, make him pay for what he did. No one tells you that the exam may be pointless \u2014 that police might treat your kit like trash. A CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher and was arrived at through an analysis of the departments\u2019 own records. The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed. Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes. For the past several years, public attention has focused on the hundreds of thousands of kits that have languished untested. The Justice Department has awarded more than $150 million to test that backlog. But destruction of rape kits is a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The evidence is gone. It can never be used to lock up a rapist or set free the wrongfully convicted. Rape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN \u201cAll the attention toward untested kits isn\u2019t enough if we have agencies destroying kits,\u201d said Wayne County, Michigan, Prosecutor Kym Worthy, whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. \u201cEach one of these kits represents a victim,\u201d said the Detroit-based prosecutor. \u201cWhat you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\u201d What you are doing [\u2026] is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice. Kym Worthy | Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor A woman who reported being gang-raped in 2007 said it was \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d to recently learn that police destroyed her untested kit. She remembered the nurse at a hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, asking her to describe what the four men did so that her body could be positioned in a way that allowed for more precise examination. \u201cIt was very invasive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was very degrading. The level of exposure \u2026 was a second violation.\u201d But she steeled herself because the nurse was collecting evidence, and she believed police would test it and use it in their investigation. Instead, CNN found, the detective assigned to her case did nothing more than interview her. The officer never tried to talk to the men she named as her attackers, misinterpreted the law and concluded that no rape occurred. About a month after speaking with the woman, the detective authorized destruction of the untested rape kit \u2014 in a state where there was no time limit to prosecute rape. \u201cI counted on the police to do what they were supposed to do \u2014 to investigate what happened to me and to test that evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, they treated it like trash. They treated me like trash.\u201d For some victims, the rape exam feels like a second trauma. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Veteran sex crimes investigators, along with experts in the law, trauma and forensic science, reviewed case files for CNN. They said investigations indicated that police lacked training in how to interact with victims of sexual violence; in the importance of testing kits, not only to solve the reported assaults but potentially other crimes; and in the need to preserve kits for the length of time the law allows for a prosecution. \u201cWhat CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\u201d said Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant who ran the San Diego Police sex crimes unit for a decade. She examined 56 case files from more than a dozen departments. What CNN discovered is a systemic problem. Joanne Archambault | Former head of San Diego Police sex crimes unit \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 but it\u2019s not the norm \u2014 that law enforcement should keep evidence at least for the statute of limitations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are mistakes in these cases, but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\u201d Twenty-five agencies in 14 states destroyed kits tied to cases while they could still be prosecuted. Department leaders at some agencies defended the destruction by saying officers approved disposal of kits in closed cases they believed had no chance of moving forward. This was a routine process, they said, done to make space in evidence rooms. Who destroyed? Law enforcement agencies responded to CNN\u2019s findings. At least five departments acknowledged that the decision to destroy kits was made without considering the statutes of limitations. Three stopped trashing kits because of CNN\u2019s inquiries. Experts said the destruction shows that rape is treated differently than other violent crimes. \u201cWould we test all the evidence\u201d in a murder? \u201cYou bet,\u201d said police trainer Tom Tremblay. The former Vermont police chief, who has reviewed rape investigations for the US Department of Justice, examined cases from nine agencies. The language police sometimes used, he and other experts said, suggested bias \u2014 describing victims\u2019 accounts of their rapes as \u201chaving sex,\u201d asking whether victims experienced orgasms and focusing on a victim\u2019s behavior rather than the suspect\u2019s. All of it, Tremblay said, communicates one thing to a victim: You are not believed. Kym Worthy: The prosecutor is herself a rape survivor. She calls the destruction of rape kits a betrayal. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Worthy understands personally what\u2019s at stake. She isn\u2019t just a prosecutor; she\u2019s a survivor. She was raped in law school, she said, and \u2014 like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally \u2014 chose not to report her attack. It is a triumph, Worthy said, when a victim musters the courage to go to police and consent to a rape exam. And destroying a rape kit is a betrayal.\n\nDuring a life-threatening trauma like rape, the defense circuitry of the brain drives the victim\u2019s sole objective: to survive. Reflexes govern reaction \u2014 running away, punching the attacker, lying there paralyzed. Stress hormones can impair a victim\u2019s memory and the ability to make complex, rational decisions. Investigators trained in the effects of trauma know that a victim\u2019s first account of an assault may not be complete, experts said, and it may not be the best time to ask some questions. Yet documents CNN examined showed officers sometimes asked questions that threatened to overwhelm victims or put them on the defensive. Did you say no? Did you fight back? Why didn\u2019t you call police right away? Though experts say victims should be interviewed wherever they feel most comfortable, documents showed police sometimes ask them to come to the station, just as they do suspects. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A traumatized person\u2019s instinct is often to avoid the pain that can come from retelling or reliving the experience. Avoidance and withdrawal are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But when victims pulled away from investigations soon after they reported being assaulted, when the trauma was fresh, some police officers were quick to label them uncooperative and close their cases. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to sniff out the liar,\u201d said Justin Boardman, a former Utah police detective who teaches cops how to understand trauma. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t give us this training that says \u2014 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s pulling away because she\u2019s traumatized, or she can\u2019t tell me this detail because she legit can\u2019t remember\u2019 \u2014 we think she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s hiding something.\u201d Experts who reviewed cases said detectives appeared to rush victims into making consequential decisions, effectively ending some cases. They noted that investigators violated longstanding best practices by asking victims if they wanted to prosecute their attackers soon after reporting the assaults to police \u2014 sometimes the same day. That question, they said, can intimidate victims and cause them to withdraw. Resources For help, survivors can call 800-656-4673. More guidance for victims and training for investigators can be found here. Prosecution should be discussed only after a thorough investigation is complete, experts said, when a prosecutor \u2014 not a victim \u2014 has determined that charges can be filed. Some victims who expressed reluctance to proceed with a prosecution were asked to sign forms attesting to that. But victims should not be given waivers declining prosecution, according to guidelines by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as far back as 2005. Only the statute of limitations should constrain a victim\u2019s right to change her or his mind about moving forward with a prosecution, the association says. More recently issued guidelines also stress that an investigator should try to spend time building rapport with a victim. Unless the public is in imminent danger, law enforcement should work at a pace comfortable for the victim. Some case files showed detectives closed cases and called victims uncooperative if they didn\u2019t meet arbitrary deadlines. In North Charleston, South Carolina, a woman reported being raped at knifepoint by a man who had once been a sexual partner. Police noted she\u2019d been arrested for prostitution two years earlier and quizzed her about whether he was a client. She told them no. Though she did not know her assailant\u2019s name, she called police twice after her initial interview with information she thought might help identify him, according to the case file. But when she failed to return a detective\u2019s call in a week\u2019s time, he wrote that she was uncooperative and ended the investigation 17 days after she reported being raped. Her kit \u2014 never tested \u2014 was destroyed less than a year later, even though testing might have identified the man. There was no statute of limitations on the crime, meaning the woman should have had as much time as she needed to help police pursue her assailant. Rape survivors expect the evidence taken from their bodies to be sealed up, given to police and sent to a lab for testing. CNN found hundreds of kits were destroyed without being analyzed. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN North Charleston\u2019s detective bureau commander, Major Scott Perry, declined to specify why the kit was destroyed. \u201cEach case is evaluated on its own facts,\u201d he said, adding that the investigation could be reopened at any time if the victim re-approached police. He conceded, however, that not having the rape kit would make the case \u201cmore difficult to prosecute.\u201d In Springfield, Missouri, police labeled victims uncooperative when they didn\u2019t respond to letters mailed to their homes warning that they had 10 business days to contact a detective or their assaults would not be further investigated. In at least six cases, records show, a detective sent the letter the day the officer was assigned to investigate. The victims had undergone rape exams and given initial accounts to patrol officers, actions that demonstrated a desire for the crimes to be investigated. But when victims didn\u2019t meet that 10-day deadline, Springfield police sometimes sent another letter, telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond led to the closing of their cases. The kits were later destroyed, even though the crimes remained within the statutes of limitations. \u2018Failure\u2019 to cooperate When Springfield victims didn\u2019t meet detectives\u2019 deadlines, police sent another letter telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d led to the closing of their cases. Source: Springfield Police Department Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said the 10-day letter is a tool used in all kinds of cases to spur a victim to work with police. He said investigators should use it only as a last resort \u2014 after a detective has exhausted every other means to reach a victim. He did not explain why some letters were sent immediately after victims reported being raped. The letter is \u201ca way to justify not doing your job,\u201d said Archambault, the retired San Diego sex crimes investigator who reviewed cases. It should never be sent to rape victims, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. This type of response will guarantee that the majority of victims will not participate in the investigation.\u201d Victims sometimes leave their homes because they are afraid an attacker will find them again. It\u2019s \u201cabsurd,\u201d she said, to expect victims to check the mail and respond to a demand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that [victims] are being uncooperative. They\u2019re just dealing with survival. They\u2019re trying to get out of bed, get their clothes on, get to work, get the kids to school,\u201d Archambault said. Police should instead give victims time \u2014 and access to counseling and services that help them feel safe, experts said. After that, they are far more likely to work with law enforcement. Joanne Archambault: The former sex crimes investigator says police label victims uncooperative, but \u201cthey\u2019re just dealing with survival.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A woman in West Valley, Utah, said she told police she was terrified that her rapist would hunt her down again, but she received neither time nor support. According to her case file, the woman told a patrol officer that a man she\u2019d broken up with came to her home and raped her. He ordered her to \u201cshut her mouth,\u201d or he would \u201churt her,\u201d she told the officer. He forced her into his car. She said she eventually managed to jump out and run into a K-Mart, where someone called 911. The woman gave police an initial statement about the assault and underwent a rape exam. Ten days later, on January 27, 2009, Detective Ryan Humphrey noted that she called him. She said she was \u201cscared to pursue charges,\u201d he wrote in the case file. He shut down the investigation. CNN reached the woman, who was upset to learn that her rape kit was destroyed and never tested. She called the failure to analyze it \u201cpathetic.\u201d Police did not offer to take steps to protect her, she said. If they had, she might have gained confidence and worked with police. She said she wishes they\u2019d told her, \u201c\u2018Well, we can still help you through this.\u2019\u201d (She asked that her name be withheld, and CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims.) Humphrey, who no longer works for the department, said that in the 10 days between the woman\u2019s report and her phone call, he did not try to locate and interview the suspect or do any other work on the case. Like investigators at other agencies, Humphrey said resources were tight, and he struggled under the weight of a heavy caseload. He closed the investigation, he said, because he assumed that the district attorney wouldn\u2019t file charges in a case without a victim\u2019s cooperation. As he reflected on the case, he acknowledged he could have given the woman more time by leaving the case open and trying to build trust and rapport with her. He could have done what experts said is protocol: offer her a safety plan to allay her fears, such as patrolling near her home or helping her file a restraining order. He agreed that the woman could have changed her mind and re-engaged when she was ready \u2014 her right in a state that had no statute of limitations to prosecute rape at the time she reported the crime. \u201cObviously, she wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she went to the hospital and had a rape exam done.\u201d A specially trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner may spend three to five hours or more gathering evidence from a victim\u2019s body. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Humphrey said he did not authorize destruction of the woman\u2019s rape kit but understood that once he closed a case, the evidence would be disposed. Her kit should have been preserved, he said. Not keeping the investigation open was \u201ca mistake. I look back at this case and can see that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are many obstacles to a successful rape investigation. A victim is too scared to continue working with police. A suspect claims sex was consensual. Testing a kit doesn\u2019t crack a case. But those circumstances shouldn\u2019t necessarily end an investigation. Officers can press pause and set cases aside, then reopen them if there\u2019s a break \u2014 a victim changes his or her mind, new leads emerge, technology improves and evidence can be retested. Yet CNN identified 17 departments that destroyed a combined 92 kits in sex crimes investigations that police described as open or in other terms that mean the same thing, such as inactive or suspended. In Idaho, Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Chief Lee White acknowledged that his department discarded rape kits in cases marked inactive. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears we were too quick at the trigger to dispose.\u201d In Farmington, New Mexico, police reported destroying kits in at least eight cases labeled inactive. Chief Steve Hebbe reviewed those cases and said the kits should not have been trashed. He then ordered a major change. \u201cWe will not destroy sexual assault kits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy them until after the statute of limitations is out.\u201d The chief also said he made sure his officers received fresh training in sex crimes investigations. Proper training includes an understanding of what DNA testing can do \u2014 even when suspects claim sex was consensual. In several departments, CNN found officers failed to test kits in so-called consent cases because they believed testing would only demonstrate that sex occurred, not whether a crime occurred. That\u2019s short-sighted, experts said. A DNA profile of the suspect in a consent case could match a DNA profile of an unidentified attacker in another rape, connecting those crimes and helping to solve them both. The testing of the backlog in Wayne County, Michigan, has linked kits in \u201cconsent\u201d cases to suspects in other sexual assaults, said prosecutor Worthy. CNN also discovered cases in which police listed \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as a reason to destroy kits that were never analyzed. Testing might have produced evidence, advancing investigations while there was still time to prosecute. Even a tested kit that fails to yield DNA evidence during an initial analysis should be preserved, forensic experts said, because testing technology is constantly improving. DNA that couldn\u2019t be detected just a few years ago can sometimes be recovered today. Nakamura memo Two police departments \u2014 Salt Lake City and West Valley \u2014 continued to destroy rape kits after Salt Lake County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Blake Nakamura said he sent them a 2011 memo ordering that evidence be maintained. Source: Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office Blake Nakamura, the chief deputy prosecutor in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County, said he came to understand the importance of preserving evidence in sex crimes cases years ago. Nakamura has been on both sides in the courtroom. As a private defense attorney, he successfully defended a man accused of sexually abusing a child by blocking the admission of evidence. When he became a prosecutor, he wanted to be able to admit all evidence and knew he had to protect rape kits from destruction. So in 2011, he sent a memo to police departments in his county, notifying them to keep all evidence in sex offense cases. At least two failed to follow his directive: Salt Lake City and West Valley. They provided records to CNN showing they continued to destroy kits for at least a couple more years. They also provided documentation showing why: Prosecutors in Nakamura\u2019s office approved the destruction. When CNN showed those records to Nakamura, he was irate. He later spoke with his staff in colorful language he said he couldn\u2019t share. But the prosecutor feels certain they got his message.\n\nIt is particularly egregious, experts said, to destroy rape kits belonging to children, the most vulnerable victims. Young victims often can\u2019t express what happened to them, so their rape kits can speak for them. The evidence can prove abuse because suspects, unlike in adult cases, can\u2019t argue that sexual contact was consensual. Children who report being sexually assaulted should be interviewed by experts trained in dealing with young victims. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Statutes of limitations for teenagers and children typically do not start until victims reach adulthood. \u201cIt takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, a professor and attorney who analyzed juvenile cases for CNN to determine whether they had been destroyed before the statutes of limitations. \u201cWhat police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\u201d Hamilton and CNN identified 47 children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 rape kits that were destroyed before the statutes of limitations expired or where there was no time limit to prosecute. At least 39 were untested. CNN\u2019s analysis did not include \u201cunfounded\u201d cases, those in which police determined that no crime was attempted or occurred. But Hamilton, whose non-profit CHILD USA advocates for sexual abuse victims, argued that given the complexity of child sex abuse, juvenile reports should rarely be labeled unfounded. In Fallon, Nevada, a detective dismissed a 7-year-old\u2019s case as unfounded, partly because the child looked away from him as he questioned her in 2013. The girl described how a man had assaulted her anally, orally and vaginally the previous night, and then methodically cleansed her body. Even though the child was consistent in describing the incident to others, the detective said her body language \u2014 looking away \u2014 indicated she was being deceptive. The detective suggested to her parents that they get her psychological help. Marci Hamilton: The head of CHILD USA says children rarely report sexual abuse when it happens; when they do, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary. When they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Police destroyed the girl\u2019s untested rape kit seven months after the allegations of abuse were made. Experts said the 7-year-old\u2019s account should have raised a red flag; until children reach puberty and start to have sexual urges, they are generally incapable of imagining rape scenarios. The detective, they added, seemed to judge the child\u2019s body language as he would an adult\u2019s. The police chief in Fallon, Kevin Gehman, said the girl\u2019s account was fully investigated but acknowledged \u201csome weaknesses in the investigative process.\u201d He would not elaborate. CNN\u2019s questions about the case prompted a review of all sexual assault investigations by the police and the city attorney. As a result, the attorney instructed police to stop destroying rape kits. The statutes of limitations on sex crimes against children typically do not begin ticking until they reach legal adulthood. Melissa Golden/REDUX for CNN Hamilton and other experts said it is rare for minors to disclose abuse soon after it occurs. Out of fear or confusion \u2014 or because predators manipulate them \u2014 young victims may delay talking about what happened for years, if not decades. That\u2019s all the more reason to maintain their rape kits. When children report what happened immediately, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhen they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "5 takeaways from CNN's investigation into rape kit destruction", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7IeaX3AyBoo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:38", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In the era of #MeToo and stories about the alleged perpetrators of sexual violence, CNN's exclusive investigation \"Destroyed\" turns the spotlight on those responsible for protecting the public.\n\nAn examination into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute.\n\nThe number is likely higher and was calculated by analyzing the departments' own records.\n\nThe destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete police investigations.\n\nMost of the kits were untested, CNN found, and dozens were discarded mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence.\n\nJournalists long ago brought to light the failure of law enforcement agencies to send thousands of rape kits to be analyzed for DNA. That revelation ignited national outrage, prompted the passage of laws ordering the testing of rape kits and spurred the Justice Department to award more than $150 million to help analyze the backlog.\n\n\"Destroyed\" exposes a lesser-known and more fundamental problem:\n\nThe rape kits are gone. They can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted.\n\nThis North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed.\n\n1. 'A systemic problem'\n\nA rape kit should be maintained for at least the length of time a crime can be prosecuted, experts told CNN.\n\nYet decisions about whether and when to destroy this evidence, CNN found, were made without considering the statutes of limitations.\n\nSome police departments defended the destruction of kits tied to closed cases that they believed had no chance of moving forward, such as when a prosecutor declined to bring a charge or when a victim who reported being raped stopped engaging with police.\n\nBut experts called that short-sighted.\n\nAnything can develop in a case while the statute of limitations is still running. New evidence can emerge or a victim may decide to work again with police, for example.\n\n\"What CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault, who ran the San Diego Police Department's sex crimes unit for a decade.\n\n\"You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations [expires].\"\n\nArchambault was among the experts CNN asked to review cases that ended in kit destruction.\n\n\"There are mistakes in these cases,\" she said, \"but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\"\n\nRape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice.\n\n2. The destruction of kits is a tragedy as troubling as the backlog\n\nDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy's office has fought to test the backlog of 10,000 unanalyzed kits in Wayne County, Michigan. That effort identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. Testing kits can not only solve crimes, it can prevent future ones by stopping would-be repeat perpetrators before they strike again.\n\nWorthy was stunned to hear that law enforcement agencies have destroyed rape kits -- most of them never analyzed.\n\n\"All the attention toward untested kits isn't enough if we have agencies destroying kits.\"\n\nShe isn't just a prosecutor. She's a survivor. Worthy was raped in law school, she said, and -- like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally -- she chose not to report her attack.\n\nIt's a triumph, she said, when a victim musters the courage to undergo an hours-long, invasive forensic examination with the hope that the DNA recovered will aid police in pursuing their assailant.\n\n\"Each one of these kits represents a victim,\" Worthy said. \"What you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\"\n\nExperts who examined case files for CNN found detectives improperly labeled cases \"unfounded\" \u2014 a term that means no crime occurred or was attempted.\n\n3. Destruction of rape kits followed poorly conducted investigations\n\nSeasoned police trainers, a former prosecutor, a DNA analyst and a trauma expert were among those who reviewed investigative case files in which kits were destroyed. They pointed to numerous flaws: kits were not tested, suspects were not interviewed, witnesses were not pursued. These experts taught CNN reporters, who reviewed more than 1,400 rape investigations, how to discern whether cases were conducted in a thorough and trauma-informed way.\n\nDetectives trained in how trauma affects victims know that withdrawal and avoidance are common symptoms. Best practice is to work at a pace set by the victim, connect the victim to advocacy services and offer, if needed, safety measures to protect a victim after a reported assault. It's critical to build rapport with a victim whose trust has been so severely violated, experts said. And that can only come by giving victims the time they need.\n\nBut that's not what CNN and experts saw in case after case.\n\nDetectives imposed arbitrary deadlines on victims and when they did not meet them, investigators closed cases, labeled victims \"uncooperative\" and relegated rape kits to evidence rooms until the evidence was trashed.\n\nA detective with the Springfield, Missouri, Police Department sent letters to victims, in some cases the day after they reported their assaults, warning that if they did not get in touch within 10 business days, their cases would not be investigated further.\n\n\"Victims have lost control of the most personal decision we make -- who we choose to be intimate with. They want some control back... When we send them a letter saying, 'Yeah, do this or else,'... (it) sounds very demanding, it sounds very much like what they may have experienced with the offender,\" said police trainer Tom Tremblay, a former sex crimes investigator who reviewed case files for CNN.\n\n4. The rape kits of the most vulnerable victims were destroyed\n\nIn the cases reviewed by CNN and Marci Hamilton, a law professor and attorney who is a nationally recognized expert on child sex crimes law, rape kits taken from minors who reported sexual abuse were destroyed by police while the alleged crimes could have still been prosecuted.\n\nTypically, the statute of limitations to prosecute a sex crime involving a victim who is a minor doesn't start ticking until the victim reaches legal adulthood.\n\n\"It takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\" Hamilton said. \"What police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\"\n\nCNN found that the rape kits of children and teenagers were among those discarded while the statutes of limitations were still running.\n\nCNN highlighted several cases that underscore Hamilton's outrage, including that of a 16-year-old who told police in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that her father raped her.\n\nA state crime lab notified the detective that it found the man's sperm in the teen's rape kit . But the investigator did not pursue the man. Instead, the detective wrote that he could not find the teenager, closed the case and then authorized the destruction of the girl's rape kit. Years later, police reopened the case and arrested the father without the evidence they said tied him to the crime. What followed was more anguish for the girl -- now a woman -- and another failure for the department.\n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, police trashed a 4-year-old's rape kit and the shorts she was wearing on the day of her alleged assault -- without ever testing that evidence. The girl's mother said she saw a wet spot on her daughter's shorts, and the child disclosed to a forensic interviewer that she was touched in her genital area by her uncle. Policing and legal experts who read the case file said it was possible the wet spot was bodily fluid left by the alleged abuser.\n\nWithout testing the shorts or rape kit evidence, police took their investigation to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges. The attorney explained her decision in writing: \"Unfortunately, no corroborating evidence.\"\n\nPolice ended the case and, two years later, in 2014, destroyed the girl's rape kit and shorts. Testing both might have provided corroborating evidence, experts said.\n\n5. Why this happened and how to start to fix it\n\nIt comes down to money, training and values. Departments said they didn't have enough of the first two. And experts said the third requires a commitment by agency leaders to examine their department's investigations and ask, \"How can we do better?\"\n\nCNN began reporting this project in 2016 after the police chief in Fayetteville, North Carolina, announced at a news conference that his department had regrettably destroyed 333 rape kits.\n\nThe officer who discovered the destruction, Lieutenant John Somerindyke, said detectives had the authority to approve disposal of rape kits in their cases and did so often after conducting poor investigations.\n\nLieutenant John Somerindyke: The head of the cold case unit in Fayetteville, North Carolina, spent two years reviewing old rape files. Many cases looked as though they could have been solved, but the rape kits were gone.\n\nThe agency failed victims because officers carried caseloads that were too large, he said, and the department lacked adequate resources. And, investigators were not trained to understand how victims behave after trauma.\n\nOther departments that destroyed rape kits echoed those complaints.\n\nOne answer, experts said, is more training at agencies nationwide on trauma and on the importance of testing and preserving rape kits.\n\nThey also said departments should regularly audit sex crimes investigations, and those audits should ideally be done by professionals outside the agency.\n\nFor now, that isn't happening. But there has long been at least one exception: The Philadelphia Police Department. It began annually reviewing its sex crimes investigations with the help of the Women's Law Project in 2000 after the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the police had mishandled rape cases.\n\n\"It's the essence of community policing,\" said attorney Carol Tracy, director of the Philadelphia Women's Law Project.\n\nTracy reviewed rape investigations for CNN and has consulted with departments across the country grappling with their backlog of untested rape kits.\n\n\"Kits being destroyed,\" she said. \"That is something I didn't realize was happening.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Drug overdoses, suicides cause drop in 2017 US life expectancy; CDC director calls it a 'wakeup call'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/0mSyXZ36eqU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:39", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Life expectancy in the United States declined from 2016 to 2017, yet the 10 leading causes of death remained the same, according to three government reports released Thursday. Increasing deaths due to drug overdoses and suicides explain this slight downtick in life expectancy, the US Centers for Disease Control says.\n\nOverdose deaths reached a new high in 2017, topping 70,000, while the suicide rate increased by 3.7%, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reports.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, CDC director, called the trend tragic and troubling. \"Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nGeneral US death rates\n\nThe estimate of how long a person born in 2017 can expect to live in the United States is 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2016, the government statisticians say.\n\nAs usual, women will continue to outlive men. In both 2016 and 2017, female life expectancy was 81.1 years, while male life expectancy dropped from 76.2 years in 2016 to 76.1 in 2017.\n\nThe number of resident deaths recorded in the nation totaled more than 2.8 million in 2017, about 69,000 more than in 2016, the report shows. Naturally, this increase affects the overall death rate, which is annually adjusted to account for the changing age of the general population. The rate increased from nearly 729 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016 to nearly 732 deaths in 2017 -- a rise of 0.4%.\n\nMost races and ethnic groups, including black males, Hispanic males and Hispanic females, saw no significant changes in their death rate year over year.\n\nHowever, black females experienced a 0.8% decreasing death rate in 2017 over the previous year, meaning they lived a bit longer, while the rate increased by 0.6% for white males and by 0.9% for white females.\n\nFinally, the 10 leading causes of death in 2017, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all deaths across the nation, were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease and suicide. This grim \"top 10 list\" remained unchanged from the previous year.\n\nDrug overdose deaths\n\nDrug overdose deaths among US residents totaled 70,237 in 2017, nearly 6,600 more than in 2016, a second government report finds. The rate increased from about 6 overdose deaths per 100,000 people in 1999 to nearly 22 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nRates have been consistently and significantly higher for males than females throughout the years, increasing from about 8 men dying of an overdose per 100,000 in 1999 to about 29 men per 100,000 in 2017. Among women, the rate increased from about 4 overdose deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to about 14 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nAge was an influencing factor in these deaths, the researchers found. Adults between 25 and 54 experienced the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in 2017. The 25-to-34 group had nearly 38 overdose deaths per 100,000, the 35-to-44 group had 39 per 100,000, and the 45-to-54 group had about 38 per 100,000.\n\nYounger and older people died by overdose less frequently, the report indicates. People between the ages of 15 and 24 experienced about 13 overdose deaths per 100,000, those between 55 and 64 experienced 28 per 100,000, and the 65 and older age group had about 7 deaths per 100,000.\n\nOverall, the greatest increase in drug overdose death rates was among adults between 55 and 64 for the period 1999 to 2017: About 4 deaths per 100,000 occurred in this group in 1999, compared with 28 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nPlace also mattered when it came to drug overdose deaths, with some states registering higher numbers than others, the report shows. The 2017 rate in West Virginia was nearly 58 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, in Ohio about 46 per 100,000, in Pennsylvania about 44 per 100,000, and in the District of Columbia, 44 per 100,000. Meanwhile, Texas (about 10 drug overdose deaths per 100,000), North Dakota (about 9 per 100,000), South Dakota and Nebraska (both about 8 per 100,000) had the lowest rates in 2017.\n\nThe heroin overdose death rate remained constant at about 5 deaths per 100,000 people for both 2016 and 2017; that said, it is seven times higher than in 1999. By contrast, overdose deaths involving fentanyl, fentanyl analogs and other synthetic opioids (other than methadone) increased by 45% between 2016 and 2017, rising from about 6 deaths per 100,000 to 9 per 100,000.\n\nDeaths by suicide\n\nOver the past decade, suicide has ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, a third new final government report reveals. Though constant, the rate has increased over time from about 10 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017. And female suicides increased at a higher rate than male suicides during this period, though more men than women die by suicide each year.\n\nAmong males, the rate increased 26% between 1999 and 2017, from about 18 suicides per 100,000 to nearly 22 per 100,000.\n\nAmong females, the rate increased 53% from 4 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to nearly 6 per 100,000 in 2017. Women between the ages of 45 and 64 experienced the highest rates in both 1999 (6 suicides per 100,000) and 2017 (nearly 10 suicides per 100,000).\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nRates in rural US counties are nearly twice as high as in urban counties, the government statisticians say.\n\nIn 1999, the suicide rate for the most rural counties was about 13 per 100,000, compared with nearly 10 per 100,000 in the most urban counties.\n\nIn 2017, the suicide rate for the most rural counties (20 per 100,000) outpaced that in the most urban counties (about 11 per 100,000). However, this 2017 urban suicide rate is 16% higher than in 1999 (about 10 per 100,000), while the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties is 53% higher than in 1999 (about 13 per 100,000), the report indicates.\n\n\"We must all work together to reverse this trend and help ensure that all Americans live longer and healthier,\" Redfield said in his statement, of the decline in life expectancy.

The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the \"only possible one\".\n\nHe said: \"If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nBut a senior UK official said: \"Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU.\n\n\"But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year.\"\n\nWill the EU re-negotiate?\n\nThe BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler\n\nWhat is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories?\n\nWell, the EU is watching and waiting.

David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett told the Financial Times they all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum.\n\nAlthough Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be \"difficult to see\" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper.\n\nMinisters step up efforts to sell deal\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the public mood was changing\n\nIn a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics \"are yet to face up to\" the \"tough choices\" she had to make.\n\nHe told the BBC the PM was \"changing the public mood\" and while different approaches would give the UK a freer hand to strike other trade deals, they would come with a \"price\" in terms of reduced access to EU markets.\n\nThe Financial Times says Mrs May is enlisting the support of senior Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox to try to sell her controversial Irish \"backstop\" plan to sceptical Tory MPs.\n\nMr Fox said he was not \"enthusiastic\" about the backstop, which could see the UK enter a customs partnership with the EU until its future relationship is sorted out and without the unilateral right to pull out.\n\nBut he insisted the chance of the backstop, described as an \"insurance policy\" by Mrs May, actually coming into force was slight as it was just as \"unpalatable\" to other EU members, including the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAnd Treasury Minister Liz Truss, who is backing Mrs May to get the agreement through Parliament, suggested parts of it could be renegotiated after the UK left the EU."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Girl, 4, saves mum with 999 ambulance call", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-46397307", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:36:51", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kaitlyn Wright, 4, called 999 when her mum was taken ill\n\nA four-year-old girl has been praised for her actions in calling for an ambulance when her mum was taken ill.\n\nKaitlyn Wright from Askerswell, Dorset, dialled 999 earlier this month when she was at home with her mother Charlene, who began having a seizure.\n\nSouth Western Ambulance Service (SWAS) said she showed \"wisdom beyond her years\" in talking to the call handler and explaining her mum's condition.\n\nParamedics were dispatched and Mrs Wright recovered.\n\n'Little guardian angel'\n\nThe ambulance service has released a recording of the call in which Kaitlyn is heard saying \"Mummy is having a fit and I need to look after her.\"\n\nA spokesperson said she \"showed extraordinary bravery, presence of mind and wisdom beyond her years\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nKaitlyn visited the SWAS's 999 control centre near Bristol earlier when she was formally commended for her actions.\n\nMrs Wright described her daughter as her \"little guardian angel\".\n\n\"I just remember Kaitlyn's dad bringing her back to the house and asking if I needed shopping and he went off.

After investigating, it discovered that an \"unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information\".\n\nIt said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers.\n\nFor about 327 million guests, the information included \"some combination\" of:\n\nname\n\naddress\n\nphone number\n\nemail address\n\npassport number\n\naccount information\n\ndate of birth\n\ngender\n\narrival and departure information\n\nIt said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen.\n\n\"We deeply regret this incident happened,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation. The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities.\"\n\nThe company has set up a website to give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service.\n\nIn a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: \"We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us.\"\n\nWhat should I do if I'm affected?\n\nThe Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database.\n\nThe database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018.\n\nThe company has set up a dedicated help website for those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065.\n\nMarriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account.\n\nAlso be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group.\n\nThe company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline.\n\nThe company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service.\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Chris Fox, technology reporter\n\nIt's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst.\n\nNot only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014.\n\nAnd even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too.\n\nThe UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whopping GDPR penalty looms.\n\nAlthough the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU.\n\nThe way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause.\n\nBut the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act.\n\nAs always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group.\n\nThe hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email.\n\nHas Marriott International contacted you to say your details have been compromised?

And just a few days later, a further 51 pilot whales died after becoming stranded on a beach on the Chatham Islands.\n\nWhile whale strandings are not uncommon, they usually involve just a single animal rather than a whole group. The recent flurry of mass strandings has brought a renewed focus on the mysterious, and rare, phenomenon.\n\nSo why does it happen? While the exact reasons remain unclear, experts say many different factors could play a part.\n\nSickness and injury\n\n\"Quite often animals that turn up on a beach are getting exhausted, they're malnourished, or they haven't eaten because they're ill,\" says Dr Simon Ingram, a Professor of Marine Conservation at the University of Plymouth.\n\n\"They can be in the final stages of being ill or die at sea and end up getting washed up on a beach,\" he adds.\n\nBut Dr Ingram says that sickness or injury mainly plays a part when a single animal is found stranded.\n\n\"The trouble is that in a huge number of animals it's quite likely that some of them are going to be ill anyway,\" he explains.\n\nIt's also true that there have been cases where groups of healthy whales have ended up getting stranded. So what could be behind these cases?\n\nNavigational mistakes\n\nSome experts say that certain aspects of the coastline or sea bed can disorientate whales, especially if they roam outside of their usual habitat.\n\n\"Some places like the tip of New Zealand are hotspots for stranding,\" says Dr Ingram.\n\n\"Sometimes this is due to geographic features of the coastline. If there's a feature like a peninsular or headland then animals that should be in deeper [waters] may suddenly find themselves in a confusing, shallow, bay.\"\n\nImage copyright DoC Image caption Dead pilot whales on a beach in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand\n\nShallow water can pose a risk to pilot whales in particular because of the way in which they navigate and communicate.\n\n\"These animals forage and feed largely by echolocation,\" says Dr Andrew Brownlow, a veterinary pathologist who has undertaken post-mortems on stranded pilot whales in Scotland. \"So they use sound to navigate and communicate and find their prey.\"\n\n\"Using echolocation in areas with very shallow, silty mud is like trying to walk through a forest on a foggy day,\" he explains, \"It's very hard to get your bearings and see clearly.\"\n\nThis combination of shallow waters and confused, muddled, echolocation is a serious danger and may lead to mass strandings.\n\n\"They end up coming into shallow areas and get stranded by the receding tide, so the natural lay-of-the-land is a real risk factor for these animals,\" Dr Brownlow says.\n\nImage copyright DoC Image caption Many of the whales had severe injuries from being caught in the shallow water\n\nFollowing the leader\n\nBut if a single whale gets injured or lost, why do they end up beached in such large numbers? Experts say the answer lies in their herd-like behaviour.\n\n\"It's a problem you get with these very social animals that tend to, for reasons we have never been clear on, end up following either a sick leader onto the beach or end up getting lost as a group,\" Dr Brownlow says.\n\n\"This particular species seems to be very prone to that herd behaviour.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Pilot whales are incredibly social and may follow one another into hazards such as shallow water\n\nIt means that if one pilot whale encounters a problem then it can have an impact on the entire group.\n\nDr Brownlow points to one case in 2015 when around 30 whales became stranded on the Isle of Skye, off Scotland's west coast.\n\n\"We think that was because one of the females was having trouble giving birth and was in a lot distress,\" he explains. \"She came into shallow waters, and all the other members of the group followed her onto the beach.\"\n\nWarming waters\n\nAnother possible cause of strandings, some experts suggest, is warmer water temperatures.\n\n\"We've had an unusual week, which we haven't got to the bottom of, and it's fair to say it's been an entirely unusual year,\" Dr Karen Stockin, a marine mammal scientist based at New Zealand's Massey University, told AFP news agency after the latest mass stranding.\n\n\"I suspect a lot of that has been driven by the warmer sea surface temperatures that we're seeing at the moment.\"\n\nShe explained: \"That's likely affecting where the prey is moving and as a consequence we're seeing prey moving and [whale] species following.\"\n\nNew Zealand's summer begins on Saturday and Dr Stockin warned that there could be more beachings to come.\n\n\"We're just going into stranding season now, this is only the beginning of it and we're very mindful of the fact that this a very busy start,\" she said.\n\nWhile Dr Stockin says that global warming may be playing apart in the rising sea temperatures, most experts say that it's important not to jump to conclusions about the role of humans in these cases.\n\n\"Pilot whales have probably been stranding in New Zealand since before people lived there,\" Dr Ingram says. \"It's probably not anything to do with what humans have done.\"\n\n\"It's a very dynamic ecosystem that these animals are in, so I would be very cautious in making any connection between these examples and climate change.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Satellites warn African farmers of pest infestations", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46370601", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:37:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Sven Torfinn / Panos Pictures Image caption \"Plant doctors\" can now give local farmers that pest infestations are on their way so they can take precautions\n\nUK researchers have developed an early warning system to prevent the crops of African farmers from being devastated.\n\nThe Pest Risk Information Service (Prise) combines temperature data and weather forecasts with computer models.\n\nIt then sends farmers a mobile phone alert so that they can take precautions.\n\nIt is hoped that the system will boost yields and increase farm incomes by up to 20%.\n\nPrise is being used in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia and will be rolled out soon in other parts of the world.\n\nPrise is an upgrade of a highly successful UK Aid scheme run by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International development charity (CABI).

Earlier this year, BBC Hindi's Vineet Khare visited the area and details what he witnessed there.\n\nThe route to the Carmichael mine is a long lonely ride in the wilderness - a paved road transforms into a wide dirt track before you eventually reach the remote piece of land which has so divided Australia.\n\nThe $12.5bn (\u00a39.8bn) Carmichael project coal site in Queensland state is nearly 400km (248 miles) inland from the eastern coast. It's in the Mackay region, which is home to other mining projects.\n\nThe project has been delayed for six years because of a series of legal challenges and reports evaluating its environmental impact. It's owned by the Adani group, whose chairman, Gautam Adani, is considered to be close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe controversy over the project has seen Australian banks rule out funding and earlier this month, the firm said it had scaled down production, cutting its targets by three quarters. On Thursday, CEO Lucas Dow said that the firm itself would finance the project.\n\nBut, according to media reports, there are regulatory approvals pending, without which construction cannot begin.\n\nAs we travel to the mine, everyone along the way - from taxi drivers to restaurant owners and pedestrians - seems to have an opinion about the project.\n\nThose who oppose it, including climate scientists, say that if the mines are opened up, the world \"better bid goodbye to the Paris Agreement commitment to hold temperature rise to 2C\".\n\nBut supporters say it's good for the economy and accuse protesters of being \"deep-pocketed left-wing activists hell-bent on feeding lies.\"\n\nA 'secret' camp\n\nWe decide to first visit a \"secret anti-Adani camp\", located an hour's drive and a narrow path off the main route.\n\nThe wooden gate is electronically locked \"to keep away pro-Adani elements\".

Is it true?\" another asks.\n\nBoth Mr Adani and Mr Modi come from the western state of Gujarat and their relationship goes back to when Mr Modi was the state's chief minister.\n\nThe fact that Mr Modi used a plane chartered by the Adani group to fly to Delhi after he was elected prime minister is still cited as an example of their closeness.\n\nAs far back as 2003, Mr Adani broke ranks with fellow industrialists to form a separate business lobby group. This was after they had criticised Mr Modi for the poor law and order situation in Gujarat following the 2002 riots that killed more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.\n\nAnd when Mr Modi was dropped as the keynote speaker at Wharton Business School after protests by sections of students and the faculty, the Adani group withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nThe rise in the firm's fortunes ever since Mr Modi became prime minister has been the subject of constant media and opposition scrutiny in India.\n\nAnd the fate of the Australian project is being closely watched in India, especially with the federal elections just a few months away and the possibility of another five-year term for Mr Modi.\n\nImage caption The vehicle followed the BBC crew near the mine\n\nA mysterious vehicle\n\nNext, we decide to visit the proposed site of the mine.\n\nAs we approach, we spot a vehicle following us, its headlights flashing through the dust kicked up by our pick-up jeep.\n\nIt waits as we stop to speak to some farmers who have given up their land for a nearly 400km rail line that will be used to transport the coal once the mines are operational.\n\nActivists fear that, once constructed, the rail line will revive adjoining coal projects that are currently dormant due to a lack of transport options.\n\nBut the farmers refuse to speak to us citing a confidentiality agreement.\n\nThe vehicle continues to trail us for nearly an hour.\n\nAfter we reach the site, the driver, a well-built man, films us as we walk around it.

Should I not make it back to her in time, I need you to do something very important for me: If I die, you must go see my wife and tell her I wasn\u2019t really that super into her.\n\nYes, I\u2019d rather say those words to her myself.

Then, as we kissed, I realized I probably could have done better had I not been too old and exhausted to keep looking.\n\nOf course, all I want is to be able to say this to Martha myself. If I could see her one more time, I would thank her for giving birth to our three kids and helping me raise them into mildly disappointing adults. I would tell her I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t be there to see those kids walk down the aisle themselves, or hand them off to whatever ho-hum partners they decide to waste the rest of their lives with. I would explain how I always thought the two of us would grow old together and how I always pictured myself becoming more and more resentful of her with each passing day.\n\nOne final thing: Tell my dearest wife that when I\u2019m gone, it\u2019s okay for her to move on and find another. God knows I moved on years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, with my last few breaths, I\u2019ll simply say goodbye and hope she knows that, whatever else has transpired between us, in my eyes she remains a companion who, while adequate in some respects, was ultimately unremarkable.

Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\nThe 33-year-old de facto ruler of Saudi has been under intense scrutiny following the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul last month.\n\nTrump says no meeting planned with MBS at G20\n\nAs Trump left the White House for the G20 summit in Argentina, the US president said he would have been willing to meet with Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but no such meeting was set up.\n\nTrump says he's close to doing something with China on trade\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was close to making a deal with China on trade but is not sure he wants to do it and likes where things stand now.\n\nAs he left the White House for the G20 summit in Argentina and a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump told reporters he was open to making a trade deal.\n\nKremlin confirms Putin-Trump meet\n\nThe Kremlin has announced it has received confirmation from Washington, DC, that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US counterpart Donald Trump will take place on the sidelines of this weekend's G20 summit.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the two leaders will hold a \"conversation\" on Saturday, which will be followed by longer negotiations.\n\nThe US had threatened to cancel the face-to-face talks because of an ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine following the former's seizure of three of the latter's ships in waters near the Crimean peninsula on Sunday.\n\nMerkel to press Putin over Ukraine tensions\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she will press Russian President Vladimir Putin at this weekend's G20 summit over the country's ongoing dispute with Ukraine.\n\nTensions between Kiev and Moscow have been heightened in recent days following the latter's seizure of three Ukrainian ships on Sunday in waters near the Crimean peninsula.\n\nAddressing a Ukrainian business summit in Berlin on Thursday, Merkel said the situation could only be resolved through \"talks\" as there was \"no military solution\".\n\n\"I'm for putting the facts of what we know so far on the table and (ask) that all soldiers get released and also that one doesn't force confessions like we've seen on television recently,\" she said, referring to appearances by some of the captured Ukrainians on Russian state television earlier this week.\n\nRussia's FSB security service released video footage on Tuesday of some of the captured Ukrainian sailors admitting that their actions had been deliberately provocative and that they had ignored Russian orders to stop moving through the Russian-controlled Kerch Strait.\n\nKiev contends the individuals were forced to lie under duress and has denied that the ships intruded into Russia's territorial waters.\n\nWednesday, November 28\n\nArgentine civil society organisations have kicked off a series of actions scheduled for this week against the G20 summit.\n\n\"We reject policies which favour large multinationals and imperialist countries and not the people or the rights of nature,\" said Beverly Keene, spokesperson for Confluence G20 and IMF Out, which is organising a People's Summit on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe anti-G20 gathering aims to provide an open space to discuss ideas for a peaceful and just future.\n\nArgentine judge seeks help from Turkey, Yemen in Saudi crown prince case\n\nAn Argentine judge reviewing a complaint by Human Rights Watch (HRW) against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his involvement in the war in Yemen asked Argentine's foreign ministry to seek Turkey and the International Criminal Court for information, the judge's office told Reuters news agency.\n\nOn Monday, HRW asked the judge to use a war crimes clause in its constitution to investigate any involvement by the crown prince in possible crimes against humanity in Yemen and Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe office of federal judge Ariel Lijo said on Wednesday it was seeking information on any open cases relating to the murder of Khashoggi or war crimes in Yemen.\n\nA representative of the federal prosecutor's office that is working with Judge Lijo on the complaint told Reuters it was still reviewing HRW's request and that no decision had yet been made on whether to investigate it.\n\nPutin to discuss Khashoggi murder with MBS\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will discuss the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the G20 in Buenos Aires, his foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Of course, they will talk about this subject,\" Ushakov said, referring to the Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\n\nHowever, he said the \"main aim\" of the meeting will be \"the development\" of Russian-Saudi relations.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Putin praised top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed personally for his role in agreeing to \"balance supply and demand\" in crude production.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of this organisation (OPEC) that we have succeeded 100 percent in doing this,\" Putin told attendees at an investment forum in Moscow.\n\n\n\n\"I must admit that this is largely thanks to the position of Saudi Arabia. This is essentially down to Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince,\" the Russian leader said.\n\nIMF chief warns trade tensions could hurt global economy\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Chairwoman Christine Lagarde has warned world leaders escalating trade tensions, including car tariffs and Brexit, could hurt the global economy.\n\nIn a report for the G20 leaders meeting in Buenos Aires, the IMF said car tariffs, if imposed, could cut 0.75 percent off the global economy.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on autos as part of his aggressive trade strategy focused on preserving US jobs.\n\nHe has hit half of US imports from China with steep punitive tariffs, which has drawn retaliation from Beijing.\n\n\n\nEmerging market economies, especially China and the euro area, are already seeing their economies slow, while a \"no-deal Brexit could further dent confidence\", Lagarde said in a blog post that accompanied the report.\n\nLagarde warned the upcoming G20 gathering that \"the global economy faces a critical juncture\".\n\n\n\n\"We have had a good stretch of solid growth by historical standards, but now we are facing a period where significant risks are materializing and darker clouds are looming,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Rising trade barriers are ultimately self-defeating for all involved. Thus, it is imperative that all countries steer clear of new trade barriers, while reversing recent tariffs,\" she stressed.\n\nSaudi crown prince arrives in Argentina\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman landed in Buenos Aires for the G20 summit, according to Argentine TV news.\n\nHis arrival comes amid international furore over the murder of Khashoggi and a request by Human Rights Watch that Argentina investigate him for war crimes in Yemen.\n\nAP Analysis: Will MBS be a pariah at G20?\n\nAll eyes will be on Prince Mohammed, particularly over the killing of Khashoggi. There have been allegations that he ordered the killing, which happened inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. There will be leaders who won't want to get caught in a grip-and-grin situation with MBS.\n\nIt's a photo opportunity that could cause serious ripples, even disgust, and have concrete repercussions at home by appearing to exonerate or legitimise the man US intelligence agencies concluded ordered the killing.\n\nThat won't be a problem for US President Donald Trump, who drew bipartisan ire in the US Congress for effectively giving the prince a free pass in the name of \"America First\", based on the president's vastly exaggerated claims of Saudi military contracts and investments in the US.\n\nIt may well be that Trump will go out of his way to embrace the de facto Saudi leader as others scurry away, treating him as a pariah.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has kept international pressure mounting on Saudi Arabia, is also expected to attend. The crown prince has requested a meeting with Erdogan on the sidelines of the summit, according to Ankara.\n\nMBS leaves Tunisia to Argentina to attend G20: report\n\nEarlier in the day, Reuters news agency reported that Prince Mohammad left Tunisia for Argentina to attend the G20 summit, where all eyes will be on world leaders' reaction to the man accused of ordering Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe prince left Tunisia early on Wednesday, Reuters quoted Al-Arabiya's website as saying.\n\nThe crown prince's G20 attendance is a bold effort to force the issue of whether world leaders will work with Saudi Arabia, analysts say. Riyadh is also indicating with his appearance in Buenos Aires that Prince Mohammed is back in the saddle and the worst of the controversy is over.\n\nHuman Rights Watch requested that Argentine authorities arrest the crown prince and that he be tried by a court for war crimes in Yemen and Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTuesday, November 27\n\nTrump: I may cancel Putin meeting at G20 over Ukraine conflict\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he may cancel his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Argentina because of Russia's maritime clash with Ukraine.\n\n\"Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting ... I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,\" Trump told the Washington Post in an interview.\n\nWhite House adviser says China-US trade deal still possible\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday that Trump will have a dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G20 gathering in Argentina and also held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal.\n\n\"There is a good possibility that we can make a deal and he is open to it,\" Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, told a press briefing, referring to Trump.\n\nNo plans for Trump-MBS meet at G20: Bolton\n\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton said President Donald Trump had no plans to meet Saudi Crown Prince Prince Mohammed at this week's G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that while no meetings are planned, she could not rule out any interaction between Trump and Prince Salman.\n\nTrump will meet leaders of Russia, Japan, Germany, Argentina at G20\n\nPresident Trump will have bilateral meetings with the leaders of Argentina, Russia, Japan and Germany when he and the American delegation go to Argentina for the Group of 20 summit later this week, a White House spokeswoman said on Tuesday.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet separately with China's Xi Jinping for the first time since the world's two largest economies imposed tariffs on each other's imports.\n\nNo plans for a Trump-May meeting at G20\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has no specific plans for a bilateral meeting with Trump at the G20 meeting later this week, her spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Trump stoked concerns among some of May's legislators about her Brexit deal by saying he thought it was good for the EU and may make trade between Washington and London more difficult.\n\nMay's office disputed that, saying it would allow Britain to sign trade deals with countries throughout the world.\n\nMonday, November 26\n\nTrump says he expects to raise China tariffs: WSJ\n\nTrump said on Monday he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200bnin Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said it was \"highly unlikely\" he would accept China's request to hold off on the increase.\n\nTrump, who is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires this week, said if negotiations are unsuccessful he would also put tariffs on the rest of Chinese imports.\n\nPrince Mohammed arrived in Egypt on Monday, the third leg of his first trip abroad since the murder of journalist Khashoggi in Turkey last month.\n\nPrince Mohammed is expected to travel to Tunisia after his two-day visit to Egypt before heading for a G20 meeting in Buenos Aires.\n\nLast week, Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver, said all eyes will be on MBS as world leaders gather for the G20 meeting from November 30 to December 1 in Argentina\n\nHashemi noted the Argentina trip puts Prince Mohammed in possible legal jeopardy under the policy of universal jurisdiction under international law.\n\n\"If there is a case brought against the Saudi crown prince for war crimes or murder by another court that is considered to be credible then an indictment can be issued against him when he arrives in Buenos Aires.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:24", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:29", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "UN experts: South Sudan Beset by `Alarming' Sexual Violence", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/un-experts-south-sudan-beset-by-alarming-sexual-violence/4681647.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:30", "body_paragraphs": "South Sudan is beset by \"alarming levels\" of sexual and gender-based violence and a desperate humanitarian situation, including severe food shortages, as it attempts to implement the latest peace agreement in a climate of \"deep distrust,\" U.N. experts said.\n\nThe panel of experts said in a report to the Security Council that the world's newest nation must deal with the fragmentation of armed groups \"and grave human rights abuses, including against children,\" in addition to the \"profound deficit of trust\" among almost all signatories to the September peace deal.\n\nBut most important, they said, is whether implementing the peace agreement improves the lives of the civilians, many of whom expressed to the experts \"profound cynicism and distrust of a high-level political process that appears increasingly removed from their suffering.\"\n\nThe report, which was circulated Thursday and covers a 45-day period in September and October, stressed that competition for South Sudan's natural resources including oil, gold, teak wood and charcoal remains \"central to the conflict\" both locally and nationally.\n\nThere were high hopes that South Sudan would have peace and stability after its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011.

If anything is to come of the new era of divided government, with a Republican president and Democratic control of the House, it will happen in the deal-making space between two of the country\u2019s most polarizing politicians.\n\nThe day after their election night phone call, Trump and Pelosi did speak again, indirectly, across Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cI really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting,\u201d Trump said in a press conference at the White House. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nPressed after his unusual public lobbying for Pelosi to become House speaker, Trump insisted he was sincere.\n\n\u201cA lot of people thought I was being sarcastic or I was kidding. I wasn\u2019t. I think she deserves it,\u201d he said. \u201cI also believe that Nancy Pelosi and I could work together and get a lot of things done.\u201d\n\nPelosi sent word back a few minutes later from her own press conference at the Capitol, which she delayed for nearly an hour as the president conducted his.\n\n\u201cLast night, I had a conversation with President Trump about how we could work together,\u201d Pelosi said, noting that \u201cbuilding infrastructure\u201d was one of the items they discussed.\n\n\u201cHe talked about it during his campaign and really didn\u2019t come through with it in his first two years in office,\u201d she nudged. \u201cI hope that we can do that because we want to create jobs from sea to shining sea.\u201d\n\nDespite all the campaign trail trash talk, both Trump and Pelosi have incentive to make some deals.\n\nThe president could use a domestic policy win heading into his own re-election in 2020, alongside his regular railing against illegal immigration, the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of the Russia investigation or other issues that emerge from his tweets.\n\nDemocrats, too, need to show Americans they can do more than resist the Trump White House. It\u2019s no surprise that two of the top Democratic priorities in the new Congress, infrastructure investment and lowering health care costs, dovetail with promises Trump made to voters, but has not yet fulfilled.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s opportunities to pass legislation,\u201d said former White House legislative director Marc Short.\n\nTrump has long viewed Pelosi as both a foil and a possible partner, and she sees in him the one who can sign legislation into law.\n\nThe president has told confidants that he respects Pelosi\u2019s deal-making prowess and her ability to hang on to power in the face of a series of challenges from the left wing of the party, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and requested anonymity.\n\nHe told one ally this month that he respected Pelosi \u201cas a fighter\u201d and that he viewed her as someone with whom he could negotiate.\n\n\u201cThe president respects her,\u201d said Short.\n\nShort described the interaction between Pelosi and Trump during a 2017 meeting with other congressional leaders at the White House to prevent a government shutdown. \u201cThey were throwing pros and cons back at each other,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe question I can\u2019t answer is to what extent will Democrats give Pelosi political bandwidth\u201d to strike deals, Short said. He pointed to potential areas of agreement like infrastructure, drug prices and prison reform.\n\nBut part of Trump\u2019s push for Pelosi to return to power was more nakedly political. Pelosi has long been a popular Republican target, spurring countless fundraising efforts and attack ads. And Trump has told advisers that, if needed, he would make her the face of the opposition in Democratic party until the 2020 presidential field sorts itself out.\n\nPelosi\u2019s name draws some of the biggest jeers at his rallies and he believes that \u201cshe could be Hillary\u201d in terms of a Clinton-like figure to rally Republicans against, according to one of the advisers familiar with the president\u2019s private conversations.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has not publicly branded Pelosi with a mocking nickname. She\u2019s no \u201cCryin\u2019\u201d Chuck Schumer, as he calls the top Senate Democrat, or \u201cLittle\u201d Adam Schiff at the Intelligence Committee or \u201cLow IQ\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who will chair the Financial Services Committee.\n\nOn whether Trump likes Pelosi as ally or adversary, Short said, \u201cI don\u2019t think those are mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nPelosi, perhaps more than her Republican counterparts \u2014 outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 became an early observer, and adapter, to the Trump style of governing.\n\nWhen Trump and Democrats were trying to broker an immigration deal in September 2017, she suggested he could tweet his assurances to the young Dreamers. And he did.\n\nAround the same time when Trump and congressional leaders convened at the White House to avoid a federal government shutdown, Republicans and Trump\u2019s own Cabinet team pressed for their preferred solution. But Pelosi kept asking a simple question: How many Republican votes could they bring to the table? When it was clear they could not bring enough for passage, Trump intervened and agreed with Democrats \u201cChuck and Nancy,\u201d as he came to call them.\n\nVotes, Pelosi explained later, were the \u201ccurrency of the realm.\u201d Trump, as a businessman, she said, got it.\n\nPelosi is poised to become House speaker again if she wins her election in January. Asked this week how Trump might react to having a woman in power, Pelosi recalled the first time she held the office, when George W. Bush was president, in 2007.\n\nBush would call her \u201cNo. 3,\u201d she said, a reference to the speaker\u2019s spot in the presidential succession line, after the president and the vice president.\n\n\u201cHe treated me and the office I hold with great respect,\u201d she said. \u201cI would expect nothing less than that from this President of the United States.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Cohen Guilty Plea Signals New Turn in Russia Probe", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cohen-guilty-plea-signals-new-turn-in-russia-probe/4680822.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:33", "body_paragraphs": "The investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election took a potentially significant turn Thursday when President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, entered a guilty plea at a federal court in New York.

Cohen is already facing prison time for bank fraud and activities related to his taxicab business.\n\nWATCH: Cohen Guilty Plea Signals New Turn in Russia Probe\n\nWhat Cohen said to Congress\n\nCohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee last year that negotiations between the Trump organization and Russia to build the tower in Moscow ended in January 2016. The talks actually continued as late as June of that year, after Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nCohen also admitted to lying to Congress about other details of the Moscow project, including his own contacts with Russian officials and that he never asked Trump to fly to Moscow himself.\n\nAccording to the charging documents, Cohen\u2019s close friend and onetime Trump employee Felix Sater talked about giving Russian President Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse in the Trump tower as a ploy to get Russian oligarchs to pay top dollar to also live there.\n\nCohen told the judge he lied to Congress because he wanted to be consistent with Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging\u201d and out of his desire \u201cto be loyal\u201d to Trump.\n\n\u200bTrump tower in Moscow\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to build a hotel-retail-apartment complex in Moscow go back more than 20 years.\n\nThe president insisted throughout the campaign that he had nothing to do with Russia and had no connections to the Kremlin.\n\nBut earlier Thursday, while standing outside the White House, Trump told reporters he had been \u201cthinking about building a building.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning. There was a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have won, in which case I would have gone back into the business and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d he asked reporters.\n\nTrump landed in Buenos Aires late Thursday for the Group of 20, a meeting of leaders from industrial and emerging-market nations.\n\nCohen had once said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump.\n\nThe president now blasts him as a \u201cweak person\u201d who lied to Mueller to get a lighter prison sentence for his financial crimes.\n\nTrump also stressed that his Moscow deal was never a secret and that he abandoned the idea because he wanted to focus on running for president.\n\nThe talks between Russia and Cohen for a Trump tower appear to be unrelated to the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nBut the negotiations over the deal were going on at the same time Russia was interfering in the election by hacking Democratic party e-mails.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, said Cohen\u2019s plea is another example of Trump allies being untruthful about Russia, asking reporters, \u201cWhat are they covering up for?\u201d\n\nDemocratic Congressman Adam Schiff, in line to become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee next year, said Cohen\u2019s guilty plea clearly demonstrates \u201cthe president\u2019s own denials during the campaign were false or misleading.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried to distance himself from Cohen, despite their long relationship. Cohen testified in August that Trump ordered him to illegally arrange payments before the 2016 election to buy the silence of two women who claim they had affairs with Trump, something Trump has denied."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "2nd GOP Senator Opposes Trump Judicial Nominee", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/second-gop-senator-opposes-trump-judicial-nominee/4680868.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:34", "body_paragraphs": "A second Republican senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, has said he will vote against President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as a district judge in North Carolina, likely dooming the prospects of Thomas Farr filling the nation\u2019s longest court vacancy.\n\nCivil rights groups such as the NAACP have heavily criticized Farr for his work defending state laws found to have discriminated against African-Americans. Farr is nominated to serve as a district court judge in North Carolina.\n\nScott announced Thursday that he would not vote for Farr, joining Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and 49 Democratic lawmakers in opposing the nominee.\n\nFormer Helms campaign lawyer\n\nFarr once served as a lawyer for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in 1990. The Justice Department alleged that about 120,000 postcards sent mostly to black voters before that election was intended to intimidate them from voting.\n\nThe postcards targeting black voters said they could be prosecuted and imprisoned for up to five years if they tried to vote in a precinct in which they had lived for fewer than 30 days.\n\nFarr told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was not consulted about the postcards and did not have any role in drafting or sending them. He said that after he had been asked to review the card, \u201cI was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African Americans.\u201d\n\nA 1991 Justice Department memo, first reported by The Washington Post, raised questions about Farr\u2019s claim that he was never consulted about the postcards. The memo said Farr had met with key campaign officials and had advised them \u201cthat a postcard mailing like the mailing conducted in 1984 would not be particularly useful\u201d except as evidence in post-election challenges.\n\nThe 1984 mailing contained an endorsement of Helms from a black minister and included an address correction request so the card would be returned if undelivered, setting up a potential avenue to challenge the legitimacy of a voter.\n\nMemo raises concerns\n\nScott, who is African-American, cited the memo as to why he would vote against Farr.\n\n\u201cThis week, a Department of Justice memo written under President George H.W. Bush came to light that shed new light on Mr. Farr\u2019s activities,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis, in turn, creates more concerns. Weighing these important factors, this afternoon I concluded that I could not support Mr. Farr\u2019s nomination.\u201d\n\nScott has supported the overwhelming majority of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, but in July, the nomination of Ryan Bounds to serve on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was withdrawn after Scott said he \u201chad unanswered questions that led to me being unable to support him.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had repeatedly criticized Republicans in recent days for moving forward with the Farr vote. He said Scott \u201chas done a courageous thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Farr has been involved in the sordid practice of voter suppression for decades and never should have been nominated, let alone confirmed to the bench. Thankfully, he won\u2019t be,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nEarlier Thursday, senators had agreed to postpone the vote on Farr until next week. That decision came less than 24 hours after Republicans needed Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote Wednesday to move Farr\u2019s nomination forward for a final vote.\n\nLongest judicial opening\n\nThe history of the judicial opening has contributed to the acrimony. President Barack Obama nominated two African-American women to serve on the court, but neither got a hearing.\n\nRepublican Sens. Thom Tillis and Richard Burr of North Carolina both supported Farr\u2019s nomination. Tillis said earlier in the week he believed that Farr was being treated unfairly.\n\nScott is the lone black Republican in the Senate. The NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus had been highly critical of Farr for his work defending state laws they said suppressed the black vote.\n\nGOP leaders in charge of the North Carolina Legislature hired Farr and others at his firm to defend congressional and legislative boundaries that the legislature approved in 2011. A federal court eventually struck some boundaries down as racial gerrymanders and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n\nFarr also helped defend a 2013 law that required photo identification to vote, reduced the number of early voting days and eliminated same-day registration during that period.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans said that requiring voter ID would increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nFarr told lawmakers that, as an advocate, he vehemently disagreed with the argument that the state\u2019s legislature sought to curtail the voting rights of people of color or any other voter. But, said, \u201cI am obligated to follow the decision by the 4th Circuit and pledge that I will do so.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said Farr is \u201cfundamentally an honest, decent and honorable man, who did nothing to deserve the assault on his character.

Now they worry about a backlash against their work, too.\n\n\u201cThe alarmists who claimed that scientists won\u2019t behave responsibly in the development of the next generation of gene editing now have ammunition,\u201d said a dismayed Kyle Orwig, a reproductive specialist at the University of Pittsburgh who hopes to eventually alter sperm production to treat infertility.\n\nHe said there is a clear public demand for the kind of research he is doing: \u201cFamilies contact me all the time,\u201d men who can\u2019t produce sperm and aren\u2019t helped by today\u2019s reproductive care.\n\nA Chinese researcher sent a shock wave through the scientific community this week when he claimed to have altered the DNA of embryos in hopes of making them resistant to the AIDS virus. He reported the birth of twin girls and said there may be another pregnancy resulting from his work.\n\nInternational guidelines for years have said gene editing that can change human heredity \u2014 through altered eggs, sperm or embryos \u2014 should not be tested in human pregnancies until scientists learn if the practice is safe. One fear is that such experiments could inadvertently damage genes that could then be passed on to future generations.\n\nChina has ordered a halt to the seemingly underground experiments by researcher He Jiankui and his team.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re afraid of: Not legitimate scientists \u2014 it\u2019s crazy people that would just try it without even worrying about consequences,\u201d said Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon Health & Science University, who is conducting laboratory-only experiments on how to repair gene defects in human embryos.\n\nIf the outcry results in more restrictions being added to the current patchwork of rules on what can be studied and how, the field \u201cwill be, probably, thrown back for decades,\u201d he added.\n\nThe challenge, said Pittsburgh\u2019s Orwig, is to \u201cconvince the community that this is one bad apple but it doesn\u2019t reflect what most people are doing.\u201d\n\nThere are multiple kinds of gene editing. Experiments to try to fix damaged genes in children and adults with diseases such as sickle cell are fairly straightforward because that drug-like approach would affect only the patient and not his or her offspring.\n\nFar more contentious is gene editing of the \u201cgermline,\u201d or changing genes in such a way that they will be passed through generations. The big ethical question is whether such tinkering should be restricted to genes that can cause otherwise untreatable disorders, or whether medicine should be free to create \u201cdesigner babies\u201d with specific traits, such as high IQ.\n\n\u201cI do think the public is probably open to pretty clearly therapeutic uses of this kind of thing, to prevent transmission of disease. But there\u2019s significant discomfort, if not complete opposition, to enhancement uses,\u201d said Josephine Johnston, an expert on biomedical ethics and policy at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute based in Garrison, New York.\n\nIn a poll last summer, the Pew Research Center found most Americans \u2014 about 7 in 10 \u2014 said changing an unborn baby\u2019s DNA to treat a serious disease the child would otherwise be born with would be appropriate. But support dropped sharply when people were told that that would involve studies with embryos.\n\nAnd just 19 percent thought gene editing for such things as enhancing intelligence would be appropriate, Pew found.\n\nHow to prove that gene editing is safe enough to legitimately try in human pregnancies is a conundrum, said University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Jonathan Moreno. \u201cNo regulator follows that child over a lifetime, much less their progeny,\u201d he noted.\n\nAnother question for ethicists: Even if it were deemed safe, is gene editing of embryos really needed given today\u2019s options? Already, families who can afford pricey in vitro fertilization can pay extra to have the embryos genetically tested \u2014 and implant only those free of well-known dangerous mutations.\n\nBut such preimplantation diagnosis isn\u2019t an answer for everyone, Johnston cautioned. IVF doesn\u2019t always produce enough embryos for couples to choose among. And as testing uncovers more and more disorders, people will have to understand \u201cthere\u2019s not going to be a perfect embryo,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Orwig sees sperm as offering possibly a more practical first step toward germline editing. Some male infertility is caused by genetic defects that prevent testicular stem cells from properly producing sperm. His team studies infertile men to find culprit genes.\n\nAmong his plans: gene-edit stem cells, and implant the repaired ones in infertile mice to see if they produce sperm that lead to healthy baby mice.\n\nThe technique could be adjusted so that the genetic change isn\u2019t necessarily passed on to the next generation, he said.\n\nYoung women undergoing certain cancer treatment already can store ovarian tissue in hopes of future pregnancy, and Orwig said one day it should be possible to remove, say, a mutation in that tissue that otherwise could spread a family\u2019s breast cancer-causing BRCA mutation.\n\nMeanwhile, careful animal work with sperm could \u201clay the foundation for how one would do it in humans,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen societal views change and policies change, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "WHO: Fear, Stigma and Ignorance Keep AIDS Epidemic Going", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/who-fear-stigma-and-ignorance-keep-aids-epidemic-going/4681039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:36", "body_paragraphs": "As the 30th World AIDS Day approaches, the World Health Organization says fear, stigma and ignorance are the reasons the AIDS epidemic is not over, because doctors can treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nWith treatment, no one needs to die from AIDS, and those with the virus can't give it to someone else.

Strathdee says people who are hungry or need shelter are more concerned about their immediate needs than they are about HIV.\n\n\"My research and research in this field really shows you have to address the whole person and their needs in order to address HIV as one of their health concerns,\" she said.\n\nStrathdee says unless this happens, countries will have to bear the heavy social and economic costs of AIDS.\n\nIn addition, Baeten says testing and treatment have to be available to everyone.\n\n\"The biggest thing that we've learned for preventing HIV in the last decades is that there is no magic bullet, but when you put a whole bunch of really good things together and it has exactly the kind of impact that a magic bullet can give you,\" he said.\n\nScientists say using these tools, educating people and getting more people into treatment will reduce stigma, and then, when a vaccine comes along, we can finally put an end to AIDS."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Rosenstein Calls for Tech Firms to Work With Law Enforcement", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rosenstein-calls-for-tech-firms-to-work-with-law-enforcement-/4680801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:38", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called on social media companies and technology firms Thursday to work with law enforcement to protect the public from cybercriminals.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a symposium on online crime, Rosenstein said that \"social media platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for the free exchange of ideas.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Porsche Shows off New Edition of Mainstay 911 Sports Car", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/porsche-shows-off-new-edition-of-mainstay-911-sports-car/4678158.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:39", "body_paragraphs": "Porsche says its future is in electric cars but for now it is rolling out a more powerful version of its internal combustion mainstay, the sleek 911 sports car.\n\nStuttgart-based Porsche, part of Volkswagen, is to show off the eighth version of its brand-defining model at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\n\n\nThe new 911 doesn't look much different than earlier editions of the car.

Once used primarily against individuals, ransomware has been increasingly employed in cyberattacks on businesses.\n\nFaramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, are accused of creating the SamSam Ransomware in December 2015 and installing it on the computer networks of more than 230 public and private entities in the United States and Canada, according to a 26-page indictment unsealed Wednesday.\n\nWith the targeted computer users unable to access their data, Savandi and Mansouri, operating out of Iran, would then demand a ransom payment made in the form of the virtual currency bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys for the encrypted data.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the two Iranians received more than $6 million in cryptocurrencies from their victims which they converted into Iranian currency, or rial, using Iran-based bitcoin exchanges. About half of the infiltrated entities refused to make a ransom payment and suffered over $30 million in lost data, according to the indictment.\n\nThe victims included the cities of Atlanta, Newark and San Diego, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the University of Calgary in Calgary, Canada, and six U.S. public health care-related entities.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the six-count indictment at a press conference in Washington.\n\n\"Every sector of our economy is a target of malicious cyberactivity,\" Rosenstein said. \"But the events described in this indictment highlight the urgent need for municipalities, public utilities, health care institutions, universities, and other public organizations to enhance their cybersecurity.\"\n\nThe two indicted Iranians remain at large and have been placed on the FBI's wanted list. They're charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, among other related crimes.\n\nThe indictment marks the first time the Justice Department has brought charges against cybercriminals involved in a ransomware and extortion scheme, according to Rosenstein.\n\nRansomware has grown in sophistication and distribution in recent years. According to a report by the cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, ransomware payments were expected to reach a record $2 billion in 2017.\n\n'Trend' from Iran\n\nThe charges are also the latest in a string of indictments brought against Iranian hackers and cybercriminals in recent months. In March, prosecutors charged nine Iranian hackers with penetrating the computer networks of hundreds of American and foreign universities and other institutions to steal valuable research material. Unlike some of the previously indicted Iranian hackers, however, Savandi and Mansouri are not believed to have ties to Tehran.\n\n\"The actions highlighted today, which represent a continuing trend of cybercriminal activity emanating from Iran, were particularly threatening, as they targeted public safety institutions, including U.S. hospital systems and governmental entities,\" said Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI. \"As cyberthreats evolve and cybercriminals develop more sophisticated techniques, so do we.\"\n\nThe 35-month computer hacking scheme led by Savandi and Mansouri began in January 2016 with an attack on an unidentified business in Mercer County, New Jersey, and moved on to public entities such as the City of Newark and health care providers such as Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said the Iranian hackers carefully chose their targets. A few days prior to attacking the network of Kansas Heart Hospital, for example, they \"conducted online searches concerning the hospital and accessed its website,\" he said.\n\nKimberly Goody, manager of cybercrime analysis at cybersecurity firm FireEye, said the hackers probably chose to target health care and government organizations because \"they provide critical services and believed their likelihood of paying was higher as a result.\"\n\nThe indictment does not name the entities that paid a ransom."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Seoul\u2019s Telecom Outage Highlights Need for Redundancy in Connected World", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-telecom-fire/4677704.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:41", "body_paragraphs": "Residents in Seoul discovered how fragile their telecommunications system was this past weekend when a fire disrupted service for millions. The government and the provider vowed to implement changes to avoid a repeat of the event, but the system failure demonstrated a need for greater redundancy and preparation for future natural and technological disasters.\n\nThe fire affected customers of KT, the nation\u2019s second largest telecommunications company. They found themselves unable to make calls, access the internet, complete ATM or credit card transactions, and watch television. Local media also reported an elderly woman died when she fell ill and her husband wasn\u2019t able to reach emergency services during the service outage.\n\nLee Manjong, chairman of the Korean Association for Terrorism Studies and professor of the department of Law & Police at Howon University, told VOA that while it is nearly impossible to prevent widespread system outages, certain steps can be taken to avoid catastrophic failures.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to split the public safety net (fire, medical, and police emergency services) and make system backups (redundancies) compulsory,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the blaze, South Korea\u2019s minister of Science and ICT (Information, Communications, and Technology), You Young-min, spoke to the CEOs of South Korea\u2019s three major communication companies (SK Telecom, KT, and LG U+) to discuss their backup plans.\n\nYou said the companies \u201cneed to swiftly change their contract clauses on compensation issues and also need to come up with plans that would reroute traffic if such accidents, which shouldn\u2019t happen again, happen.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what steps the government planned on taking to prevent a similar event in the future, the ministry declined to offer specifics, stating that responsible parties would prepare fire prevention measures this year and set up a task force to implement recommendations.\n\nLocal broadcaster MBC also reported that telecommunication companies and the government held a 20-minute virtual natural disaster drill in May to simulate a system outage, but the simulation proved to be ineffective in real-world situations.\n\nInterconnected services\n\nThe Seoul fire and resulting system outage demonstrated how interconnected services are in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIf a network is down, then it affects other networks such as finance, power, energy, and railway,\u201d said Lee.\n\nHe said there are multiple ways the electronic infrastructure can be paralyzed. This includes physical damage, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. However, Lee notes disruptions caused by cyber incursions are more effective.\n\n\u201cCyber attacks are more efficient as they can take place without access to the physical location of the target,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lee, this is because the government is able to secure physical sites, so cyber-warriors choose \u201csoft targets\u201d connected through the Internet.\n\nA distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attack could be launched from the Internet and attack telecommunication networks. This type of attack floods a computer network with incoming data packets and overwhelms the system, effectively shutting it down. Lee said such attacks on telecom systems could wreak havoc and paralyze communication.\n\nHe cautioned that a successful cyber attack on South Korea\u2019s technological infrastructure could yield \u201cunimaginable\u201d damage because of the country\u2019s reliance on networked services.\n\nFire and recovery\n\nSaturday\u2019s fire struck an underground facility of KT, destroying telephone lines and fiber optic cables, taking about 10 hours to suppress.\n\nSeoul authorities rate facilities on a scale from A to D. Buildings rated A, B, or C must have adequate fire prevention systems installed, while those receiving a D rating do not.\n\nKT\u2019s Ahyeon facility, where the fire took place, was one of 27 D-rated facilities belonging to the company. As such, fire scene investigators found there were no fire detectors or sprinkler system installed at the Ahyeon facility and only a single fire extinguisher present.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s other telecommunication carriers utilize over 800 similar facilities throughout the country, none of which are required to have fire detection equipment or sprinklers installed.\n\nLee said government regulations must be altered to bridge the gaps to ensure that such facilities are required to have redundant services elsewhere in the event of a natural disaster or cyber attack.\n\nEstimates are the blaze resulted in about $7 million in property damage. KT has announced it would compensate affected customers by awarding them a free month of service for their inconvenience. KB security expects that amount to total about $27.5 million.\n\nIn a text message to customers, KT said it was \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience. We will adopt preventive measures such as safety inspections\u2026 to avoid a recurrence.\u201d\n\nSeoul officials told VOA the cause of the fire remains unknown and the investigation to determine its source could last a month.\n\nLee Ju-hyun contributed to this report."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Swastikas Are Appearing On Google Maps And People Have Taken Notice", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-maps-swastikas_us_5c017a8be4b0a173c022cf0d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:41", "body_paragraphs": "Swastikas have been appearing on various points of interest on the Google Maps application for people around the world.\n\nOn Friday, a woman named Katie from Dublin, Ireland, tweeted that the symbol appeared for her in place of the usual bed icon that would populate on the app for hotels.\n\n\u201cI opened my maps and was looking for hotels in the surrounding area, when I noticed the swastikas.

He claimed to be \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the negotiations, but said he did not know of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s outreach to the Kremlin seeking President Vladimir Putin\u2019s help on the deal until that news had been reported by the press.\n\nPerhaps the president\u2019s son was playing word games in sworn testimony to the Senate. But his claims seem inconsistent with a detail from Cohen\u2019s latest plea agreement.\n\nIn a letter to the congressional intelligence committees sent in August 2017, Cohen had falsely contended that he \u201cdid not brief [the elder Donald Trump] or any of his family\u201d on the Moscow deal, save for three briefings to Trump himself. As his latest statement of the offense lays out, Cohen now says that he did brief Trump\u2019s family members within the company about the project. And The Wall Street Journal reported that Don Jr. was included on emails about the project.\n\nDon Jr.\u2019s exposure may extend well beyond the perjury charges that Trump advisers reportedly worry he could face for lying to Congress.\n\nCohen\u2019s statement of the offense describes lying about the Trump Tower deal to \u201cgive the false impression the Moscow Project ended before \u2018the Iowa caucus and \u2026 the very first primary,\u2019 in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nAt least for the purposes of Don Jr.\u2019s congressional appearance (the only public transcript of an investigative interview that addresses the topic), that effort to mislead had its desired effect. By sending his letter to the intelligence committees last August, Cohen established his lies before Don Jr. testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, 2017. Perhaps as a result, Judiciary Committee staffers didn\u2019t challenge the claims by the president\u2019s son that he knew very little about the deal.\n\nSo Don Jr.\u2019s claims to the committee regarding the Moscow project remain uncorrected, along with a number of other statements that we now know to be false. For example, contrary to his claim that no other foreign nationals offered or provided assistance to the Trump presidential campaign (as the Russians had done), a group from the Middle East \u2015 including Israeli, Saudi and United Arab Emirate nationals \u2015 had offered social media manipulation services at another Trump Tower meeting he attended. Don Jr.\u2019s claims that there was no follow-up to the June 2016 meeting with the Russians are also belied by later testimony and documentary evidence provided to the same Senate committee, which showed that the intermediary who set up the meeting, Rob Goldstone, made extensive efforts to set up a second meeting after Trump won and probably had direct contact with the president\u2019s son in doing so.\n\nThis likely explains the multiple reports \u2015 going back as far as August of this year and expressed more urgently in the wake of the midterm elections \u2015 that Trump fears that special counsel Robert Mueller will seek to indict his son.\n\nBut the substance of Cohen\u2019s new plea suggests Don Jr.\u2019s exposure may extend well beyond the perjury charges that Trump advisers reportedly worry he could face for lying to Congress.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images The question is: How much did Don Jr. know about what Cohen was doing?\n\nA key part of the negotiations over the Moscow Trump Tower deal, according to Cohen\u2019s plea, involved the pursuit of a meeting between Trump and Putin. As early as Jan. 21, 2016, Putin\u2019s office was responding to Cohen\u2019s requests for assistance with the real estate deal. On May 4, Cohen laid out how any meeting between the two leaders should be deferred until Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen envisioned traveling to Russia himself before the Republican National Convention in July in a discussion with businessman Felix Sater, who was trying to broker the tower deal, but said that Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin should take place \u201conce he becomes the nominee after the convention.\u201d\n\nThat puts the other efforts to work toward a meeting between Trump and Putin \u2015 including those involving the National Rifle Association and campaign staffer George Papadopoulos \u2015 in a significantly different light. Trump had a financial incentive, in the form of Putin\u2019s support for a big real estate deal in Moscow, to pursue such a meeting.\n\nMore importantly, it puts the June gathering at Trump Tower in New York in a dramatically different light. The email that Goldstone sent to set up the meeting included a line describing his offer of dirt as being part of other Russian support for Trump. The dirt he was offering, Goldstone asserted, \u201cis part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d That email means one thing if \u2015 as Don Jr. claimed \u2015 he didn\u2019t really know that his father might gain a huge real estate development by sidling up to Russians. It means something entirely different if Don Jr. knew, as Cohen\u2019s plea strongly suggests he did, about ongoing discussions regarding the Moscow project that relied on the support not just of Russian bureaucrats, but of Putin himself.\n\nFurthermore, the timing laid out in Cohen\u2019s plea hints that there may be an even closer tie. In the immediate wake of the Trump Tower meeting, at the end of which several attendees believed that Don Jr. had promised to consider eliminating Magnitsky Act sanctions against Russians if his father got elected, Cohen and Sater finalized a trip to St. Petersburg, where Cohen expected he might meet Putin. \u201cFrom on or about June 9 to June 14, 2016,\u201d the plea deal says, Sater \u201csent numerous messages to COHEN about the travel, including forms for COHEN to complete.\u201d Something happened at the last minute to change Cohen\u2019s mind. On June 14, the same day The Washington Post revealed that Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee, Cohen met Sater in the lobby of Trump Tower and said he would \u201cnot be traveling at that time.\u201d\n\nAt least in Sater\u2019s mind, the Moscow project was always connected to the presidential election. \u201cBuddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater emailed Cohen in November 2015. \u201cI will get Putins [sic] team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\u201d\n\nWith Cohen\u2019s negotiations to set up meetings with Putin in the background, the case that Don Jr. was discussing a deal in which Russia would provide dirt and facilitate a real estate project in exchange for sanctions relief gets far stronger.\n\nMueller\u2019s not there yet, at least with the information he\u2019s made public. But with Cohen\u2019s plea, he\u2019s inching closer to laying out a complex conspiracy in which Russians offered stolen emails and real estate in exchange for sanctions relief, with the president\u2019s son at the center of everything."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "How DNA Tests Make Native Americans Strangers In Their Own Land", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/making-native-americans-strangers-in-their-own-land_us_5c00601ce4b0ee1b06c83176", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:43", "body_paragraphs": "This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nBy Aviva Chomsky\n\nAmid the barrage of racist, anti-immigrant, and other attacks launched by President Trump and his administration in recent months, a series of little noted steps have threatened Native American land rights and sovereignty. Such attacks have focused on tribal sovereignty, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), and the voting rights of Native Americans, and they have come from Washington, the courts, and a state legislature. What they share is a single conceptual framework: the idea that the long history that has shaped U.S.-Native American relations has no relevance to today\u2019s realities.\n\nMeanwhile, in an apparently unrelated event, Senator Elizabeth Warren, egged on by Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d taunts and his mocking of her claims to native ancestry, triumphantly touted her DNA results to \u201cprove\u201d her Native American heritage. In turning to the burgeoning, for-profit DNA industry, however, she implicitly lent her progressive weight to claims about race and identity that go hand in hand with moves to undermine Native sovereignty.\n\nThe DNA industry has, in fact, found a way to profit from reviving and modernizing antiquated ideas about the biological origins of race and repackaging them in a cheerful, Disneyfied wrapping. While it\u2019s true that the it\u2019s-a-small-world-after-all multiculturalism of the new racial science rejects nineteenth-century scientific racism and Social Darwinism, it is offering a twenty-first-century version of pseudoscience that once again reduces race to a matter of genetics and origins. In the process, the corporate-promoted ancestry fad conveniently manages to erase the histories of conquest, colonization, and exploitation that created not just racial inequality but race itself as a crucial category in the modern world.\n\nToday\u2019s policy attacks on Native rights reproduce the same misunderstandings of race that the DNA industry is now so assiduously promoting. If Native Americans are reduced to little more than another genetic variation, there is no need for laws that acknowledge their land rights, treaty rights, and sovereignty. Nor must any thought be given to how to compensate for past harms, not to speak of the present ones that still structure their realities. A genetic understanding of race distorts such policies into unfair \u201cprivileges\u201d offered to a racially defined group and so \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against non-Natives. This is precisely the logic behind recent rulings that have denied Mashpee tribal land rights in Massachusetts, dismantled the Indian Child Welfare Act (a law aimed at preventing the removal of Native American children from their families or communities), and attempted to suppress Native voting rights in North Dakota.\n\nProfiting by Recreating Race\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at how the ancestry industry contributes to, and profits from, a twenty-first-century reformulation of race. Companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe lure customers into donating their DNA and a hefty sum of money in exchange for detailed reports claiming to reveal the exact geographical origins of their ancestors going back multiple generations. \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d asks Ancestry.com, typically enough. The answer, the company promises, lies in your genes.\n\nSuch businesses eschew the actual term \u201crace\u201d in their literature. They claim instead that DNA reveals \u201cancestry composition\u201d and \u201cethnicity.\u201d In the process, however, they turn ethnicity, a term once explicitly meant to describe culture and identity, into something that can be measured in the genes. They conflate ethnicity with geography, and geography with genetic markers. Perhaps you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the \u201cethnicities\u201d they identify bear an eerie resemblance to the \u201craces\u201d identified by European scientific racist thinking a century ago. They then produce scientific-looking \u201creports\u201d that contain purportedly exact percentages linking consumers to places as specific as \u201cSardinia\u201d or as broad as \u201cEast Asia.\u201d\n\nAt their most benign, these reports have become the equivalent of a contemporary parlor game, especially for white Americans who make up the vast majority of the participants. But there is a sinister undertone to it all, reviving as it does a long-discredited pseudoscientific basis for racism: the notion that race, ethnicity, and ancestry are revealed in the genes and the blood, and passed down inexorably, even if invisibly, from generation to generation. Behind this lies the assumption that those genes (or variations) originate within clearly defined national or geographic borders and that they reveal something meaningful about who we are \u2015 something otherwise invisible. In this way, race and ethnicity are separated from and elevated above experience, culture, and history.\n\nIs There Any Science Behind It?\n\nAlthough all humans share 99.9 percent of our DNA, there are some markers that exhibit variations. It\u2019s these markers that the testers study, relying on the fact that certain variations are more (or less) common in different geographical areas. As law and sociology professor Dorothy Roberts puts it, \u201cNo sooner had the Human Genome Project determined that human beings are 99.9% alike than many scientists shifted their focus from human genetic commonality to the 0.1% of human genetic difference. This difference is increasingly seen as encompassing race.\u201d\n\nAncestry tests rely on a fundamental \u2015 and racialized \u2015 misunderstanding of how ancestry works. The popular assumption is that each of us contains discrete and measurable percentages of the \u201cblood\u201d and DNA of our two biological parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on, and that this ancestral line can be traced back hundreds of years in a meaningful way. It can\u2019t. As science journalist Carl Zimmer explains, \u201cDNA is not a liquid that can be broken down into microscopic drops... We inherit about a quarter of our DNA from each grandparent \u2015 but only on average... If you pick one of your ancestors from 10 generations back, the odds are around 50% that you carry any DNA from him or her. The odds get even worse beyond that.\u201d\n\nIn reality, such testing does not tell us much about our ancestors. That\u2019s partly because of the way DNA is passed down through the generations and partly because there exists no database of ancestral DNA. Instead, the companies compare your DNA to that of other contemporary humans who have paid them to take the test. Then they compare your particular variations to patterns of geographical and ethnic distribution of such variations in today\u2019s world \u2015 and use secret algorithms to assign purportedly precise ancestral percentages to them.\n\nSo is there really a Sardinian or East Asian gene or genetic variation? Of course not. If there is one fact that we know about human history, it\u2019s that ours is a history of migrations. We all originated in East Africa and populated the planet through ongoing migrations and interactions. None of this has ended (and, in fact, thanks to climate change, it will only increase). Cultures, ethnicities, and settlements can\u2019t be frozen in time. The only thing that is constant is change. The peoples who reside in today\u2019s Sardinia or East Asia are a snapshot that captures only a moment in a history of motion. The DNA industry\u2019s claims about ancestry award that moment a false sense of permanence.\n\nWhile whites of European ancestry seem enthralled with the implications of this new racial science, few Native Americans have chosen to donate to such databases. Centuries of abuse at the hands of colonial researchers who made their careers on Native ancestral remains, cultural artifacts, and languages have generated a widespread skepticism toward the notion of offering genetic material for the good of \u201cscience.\u201d In fact, when it comes to one DNA testing outfit, 23andMe, all of the countries included in its lists of the geographical origins of those who have contributed to its \u201cNative American\u201d database are in Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cIn North America,\u201d the company blandly explains, \u201cNative American ancestry tends to be five or more generations back, so that little DNA evidence of this heritage remains.\u201d In other words, 23andMe claims DNA as conclusive proof of Native American identity, then uses it to write Native North Americans off the map altogether.\n\nThe Ancestry Industry and the Disappearing Indian\n\nThe ancestry industry, even while celebrating diverse origins and multiculturalism, has revived long-held ideas about purity and authenticity. For much of U.S. history, white colonizers argued that Native Americans would \u201cvanish,\u201d at least in part through biological dilution. New England\u2019s native peoples were, for instance, systematically denied land rights and tribal status in the nineteenth century on the grounds that they were too racially mixed to be \u201cauthentic\u201d Indians.\n\nAs historian Jean O\u2019Brien has explained, \u201cInsistence on \u2018blood purity\u2019 as a central criterion of \u2018authentic\u2019 Indianness reflected the scientific racism that prevailed in the nineteenth century. New England Indians had intermarried, including with African Americans, for many decades, and their failure to comply with non-Indian ideas about Indian phenotype strained the credence for their Indianness in New England minds.\u201d The supposed \u201cdisappearance\u201d of such Indians then justified the elimination of any rights that they might have had to land or sovereignty, the elimination of which, in a form of circular reasoning, only confirmed their nonexistence as a people.\n\nHowever, it was never phenotype or distant ancestry but, as O\u2019Brien points out, \u201ccomplex regional kinship networks that remained at the core of Indian identity in New England, despite the nearly complete Indian dispossession that English colonists accomplished... Even as Indians continued to reckon membership in their communities through the time-honored system of kinship, New Englanders invoked the myth of blood purity as identity in denying Indian persistence.\u201d\n\nSuch antiquated understandings of race as a biological or scientific category allowed whites to deny Indian existence \u2015 and now allow them to make biological claims about \u201cIndian\u201d identity. Until recently, such claims, as in Senator Warren\u2019s case, rested on the murkiness of family tales. Today, the supposed ability of DNA companies to find genetic \u201cproof\u201d of such a background reinforces the idea that Indian identity is something measurable in the blood and sidesteps the historical basis for the legal recognition or protection of Indian rights.\n\nThe ancestry industry assumes that there is something meaningful about the supposed racial identity of one of hundreds or even thousands of an individual\u2019s ancestors. It\u2019s an idea that plays directly into the hands of right-wingers who are intent on attacking what they call \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2015 and the notion that \u201cminorities\u201d are becoming unduly privileged.\n\nIndeed, white resentment flared at the suggestion that Senator Warren might have received some professional benefit from her claim to Native status. Despite an exhaustive investigation by the Boston Globe showing conclusively that she did not, the myth persists and has become an implicit part of Donald Trump\u2019s mockery of her. In fact, any quick scan of statistics will confirm the ludicrousness of such a position. It should be obvious that being Native American (or Black, or Latino) in the United States confers far more risks than benefits. Native Americans suffer from higher rates of poverty, unemployment, infant mortality, and low birth weight, as well as lower educational levels and shorter life spans than do whites. These statistics are the result of hundreds of years of genocide, exclusion, and discrimination \u2015 not the presence or absence of specific genetic variations.\n\nReviving Race to Undermine Native Rights\n\nNative rights, from sovereignty to acknowledgment of the conditions created by 500 years of colonial misrule, rest on an acceptance that race and identity are, in fact, the products of history. \u201cNative Americans\u201d came into being not through genes but through the historical processes of conquest and colonial rule, along with grudging and fragile acknowledgement of Native sovereignty. Native American nations are political and cultural entities, the products of history, not genes, and white people\u2019s assertions about Native American ancestry and the DNA industry\u2019s claim to be able to reveal such ancestry tend to run roughshod over this history.\n\nLet\u2019s look at three developments that have, over the past year, undermined the rights of Native Americans: the reversal of reservation status for Mashpee tribal lands in Massachusetts, the striking down of the Indian Child Welfare Act, and Republican attempts to suppress Native American votes in North Dakota. Each of these acts came from a different part of the government: the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, the courts, and North Dakota\u2019s Republican-dominated state legislature. But all three rely on notions of identity that place race firmly in our genes rather than in our history. In the process, they deny the histories that turned the sovereign and autonomous peoples of North America before European colonists arrived in \u201cthe New World\u201d into \u201cNative Americans,\u201d and imply that Native American historical rights are meaningless.\n\nThe Mashpee of Massachusetts finally achieved federal recognition and a grant of reservation land only in 2007, based on the fact that they \u201chad existed as a distinct community since the 1620s.\u201d In other words, federal recognition was based on a historical, not a racialized, understanding of ethnicity and identity. However, the tribe\u2019s drive to build a casino on its newly acquired reservation in Taunton, Massachusetts, would promptly be challenged by local property-owners. Their lawsuit relied on a technicality: that, as they argued in court, reservation land could only be granted to tribes that had been federally recognized as of 1934. In fact, the Mashpee struggle for recognition had been repeatedly stymied by long-held notions that the Indians of Massachusetts were not \u201creal\u201d or \u201cauthentic\u201d because of centuries of racial mixing. There was nothing new in this. The state\u2019s nineteenth-century legislature prefigured just such a twenty-first-century backlash against recognition when it boasted that real Indians no longer existed in Massachusetts and that the state was poised to wipe out all such \u201cdistinctions of race and caste.\u201d\n\nIn September 2018, the Department of the Interior (to which the court assigned the ultimate decision) ruled against the Mashpees. Recently appointed Assistant Director of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney, the first Native American to hold that position, \u201cpaved the way for a reservation to be taken out of trust for the first time since the termination era,\u201d a 20-year period from the 1940s to the 1960s when the federal government attempted to \u201cterminate\u201d Native sovereignty entirely by dismantling reservations and removing Indians to urban areas to \u201cassimilate\u201d them. The new ruling could affect far more than the Mashpees. Some fear that, in the Trump years, the decision portends \u201ca new termination era,\u201d or even a possible \u201cextermination era,\u201d for the country\u2019s Native Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, on October 4th, a U.S. District Court struck down the Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA. This is a potentially devastating development as Congress passed that Act in 1978 to end the then-still-common practice of breaking up Native families by removing Indian children for adoption into white families. Such acts of removal date back to the earliest days of white settlement and over the centuries included various kinds of servitude and the founding of residential boarding schools for Indian children that were aimed at eliminating Native languages, cultures, and identities, while promoting \u201cassimilation.\u201d Indian child removal continued into the late twentieth century through a federally sponsored \u201cIndian Adoption Project,\u201d as well as the sending of a remarkable number of such children into the foster care system.\n\nAccording to the ICWA, \u201cAn alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d States, it added, \u201chave often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.\u201d The Act gave tribes primary jurisdiction over all child custody issues including foster placements and the termination of parental rights, requiring for the first time that priority be placed on keeping Native children with their parents, kin, or at least within the tribe.\n\nThe ICWA said nothing about race or ancestry. Instead, it recognized \u201cIndian\u201d as a political status, while acknowledging semi-sovereign collective rights. It was based on the Constitution\u2019s implicit acknowledgement of Indian sovereignty and land rights and the assignment to the Federal government of relations with Indian tribes. The District Court\u2019s ICWA decision trampled on the collective political rights of Indian tribes by maintaining that the act discriminated against non-Native families in limiting their right to foster or adopt Native children. That rationale, like the rationale behind the Mashpee decision, directly attacks the cultural and historical acknowledgement of Native sovereignty.\n\nSuperficially, the assault on Native voting rights may appear conceptually unrelated to the Mashpee and ICWA decisions. North Dakota is one of many primarily Republican-controlled states to take advantage of a 2013 Supreme Court ruling eliminating key protections of the Voting Rights Act to make registration and voting more difficult, especially for likely Democratic voters including the poor and people of color. After numerous challenges, a North Dakota law requiring prospective voters to provide a street address was finally upheld by a Supreme Court ruling in October 2018. The problem is this: thousands of rural Native Americans, on or off that state\u2019s reservations, lack street addresses because their streets have no names, their homes no numbers. Native Americans are also disproportionately homeless.\n\nIn the North Dakota case, Native Americans are fighting for a right of American citizens \u2015 the right to vote \u2015 whereas the Mashpee and ICWA cases involve fights to defend Native sovereignty. The new voting law invoked equality and individual rights, even as it actually focused on restricting the rights of Native Americans. Underpinning such restrictions was a convenient denial by those Republicans that the country\u2019s history had, in fact, created conditions that were decidedly unequal. (Thanks to a massive and expensive local effort to defend their right to vote, however, North Dakota\u2019s Native Americans showed up in record numbers in the 2018 midterm election.)\n\nThese three political developments downplay Native American identity, sovereignty, and rights, while denying, implicitly or explicitly, that history created today\u2019s realities of racial inequality. The use of DNA tests to claim \u201cNative American\u201d genes or blood trivializes this same history.\n\nThe recognition of tribal sovereignty at least acknowledges that the existence of the United States is predicated on its imposition of an unwanted, foreign political entity on Native lands. The concept of tribal sovereignty has given Native Americans a legal and collective basis for fighting for a different way of thinking about history, rights, and nationhood. Attempts to reduce Native American identity to a race that can be identified by a gene (or a genetic variation) do violence to our history and justify ongoing violations of Native rights.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren had every right to set the record straight regarding false accusations about her employment history. She should, however, rethink the implications of letting either Donald Trump or the ancestry industry define what it means to be Native American."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Powerful 7.0 Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Near Anchorage, Alaska", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anchorage-alaska-earthquake_us_5c017624e4b0a173c022cb2d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:43", "body_paragraphs": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Back-to-back earthquakes measuring 7.0 and 5.8 rocked buildings and shattered roads Friday morning in Anchorage, sending people running into the streets and briefly triggering a warning to residents in Kodiak to flee to higher ground for fear of a tsunami.\n\nThe warning was lifted a short time later.

His agenda for the weekend includes meetings with world leaders, as well as a number of heavily choreographed group activities for the gathering of leaders of rich and developing nations.\n\nTrump faces a series of diplomatic challenges over the weekend, most notably whether he can strike an agreement with Xi.\n\nThe president canceled on Putin not long after his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, revealed he had lied to Congress to cover up that he was negotiating a real estate deal in Moscow on Trump\u2019s behalf during the Republican presidential primary in 2016. The news ensured any meeting with Putin would have put a spotlight on the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow during the campaign.

U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Saudi crown prince must have at least known of the plot to kill Khashoggi, who was critical of the Saudi royal family. Lawmakers in both parties have called on Trump to at least avoid the young heir apparent as punishment.\n\nBut Trump publicly announced his decision to effectively give the prince a pass in the name of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d making vastly exaggerated claims of Saudi military contracts and investments in the United States.

But even if Mexico\u2019s president-elect, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, supports the proposal, the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d plan is riddled with legal problems that cast doubt on its feasibility. The Trump administration\u2019s apparent interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act is perhaps the most glaring.\n\nRebecca Blackwell/ASSOCIATED PRESS An American well-wisher, left, is swarmed by migrants as he hands out canned soup, adding his efforts to those of many local Mexican groups distributing food outside of a sports complex where more than 5,000 Central Americans are sheltering in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly not what the asylum statute contemplates,\u201d Barbara Hines, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s just one more way to try to keep people from applying.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not explained the details of the plan that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is trying to negotiate with the incoming L\u00f3pez Obrador administration.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nBut the broad outlines of the plan under negotiation, first reported by BuzzFeed News earlier this month and later elaborated by The Washington Post, would require asylum-seekers arriving from Mexico to return there once their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interviews have been conducted in the U.S. The interviews are the first major step toward filing an asylum application.\n\nA \u201cSafe Third Country\u201d agreement that would require migrants to first apply for asylum in Mexico, instead of being allowed to enter the U.S. to state their case, is off the table, according to that country\u2019s soon-to-be interior secretary, Olga S\u00e1nchez Cordero.\n\nThat leaves only one obvious way to make the plan work. The Department of Homeland Security would rely on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the U.S. to return migrants who arrive at legal ports of entry by land back to the country they came from while they await deportation proceedings, according to several legal experts on immigration.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: Asylum-seekers don\u2019t appear to be subject to that section of the law.\n\nThe problem with the Trump administration\u2019s plan lies buried in the complexities of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 235 of the act does, in fact, allow the U.S. to send migrants back to Mexico if they arrive by land while they await deportation proceedings. But the same section of the law exempts people who make asylum claims and pass their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interviews from getting sent back to a neighboring country.\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is that our government hasn\u2019t thought it through,\u201d David Leopold, an immigration lawyer with decades of experience, told HuffPost. \u201cThey\u2019re so focused on closing the door to asylum that they haven\u2019t really thought about the fact that the statute doesn\u2019t cover what they want to do. You can\u2019t just throw someone outside the United States and say, \u2018Now, apply for asylum.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way to predict whether the courts will agree with the experts consulted by HuffPost. Immigration law is notoriously complex, and the meaning of the statute wasn\u2019t immediately obvious to everyone interviewed. It contains a maze of references that require jumping from one section of the law to another to decipher its meaning. Some had to read it multiple times before arriving at the conclusion that it exempted asylum-seekers.\n\n\u201cIf a student in my class wrote this, they\u2019d get an F,\u201d said former Chief Counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Stephen Legomsky, who now works as a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. However, he too thought a literal reading of the provision showed it exempts the asylum-seekers Trump wants to repel.\n\nNone doubted that the Trump administration could try to push forward, but all suspected it would face an immediate challenge in federal court.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we can say with 100 percent confidence that this is a difficult legal question that will have to be answered by a judge, assuming this change does come out,\u201d Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, told HuffPost.\n\nThose challenges wouldn\u2019t be limited to the plan\u2019s dubious legality. Pushing asylum-seekers back to Mexico would wreak logistical mayhem on an immigration court system already backlogged by more than 1 million cases.\n\nUntil now, asylum claims have been made and litigated in U.S. immigration courts. Forcing asylum-seekers to fight their cases in Mexico would require the U.S. to either set up immigration courts in that country, shuttle migrants back and forth across the border for hearings, or require video-conferencing. Any of those new burdens could lead opponents to challenge the plan as a violation of due process.\n\nThe takeaway is that our government hasn\u2019t thought it through. Immigration attorney David Leopold\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time even getting what they\u2019re imagining,\u201d said Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas\u2019 Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs. \u201cThe logistics seem really insurmountable.\u201d\n\nLee Gelernt, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, declined to comment on his organization\u2019s analysis of the contiguous country provision until the Trump administration formally announces a policy. But for the plan to work, the U.S. government would have to ensure that migrants who were returned to Mexico would be safe and that they would receive the same legal guarantees and due process there that they would in U.S. courts.\n\n\u201cThose two threshold requirements are going to doom any proposal,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cI suspect there will be other legal defects.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s own words have undermined his immigration policies in the past. Last month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s plan to strip Temporary Protected Status from Haitian, Salvadoran, Nicaraguan and Sudanese migrants, contending that the president\u2019s harsh words about them may imply racial bias.\n\nThe Trump administration has long envisioned turning migrants who arrive by land from Mexico back to wait there while their deportation cases move forward. The idea was first floated in a sweeping executive order on immigration signed by Trump five days after taking office.\n\nBut three weeks later, Mexico\u2019s secretary of foreign affairs, Luis Videgaray, flatly rejected the idea.\n\nThe L\u00f3pez Obrador administration, however, appears willing to put the idea on the table as part of a larger plan to reduce Central American migration through Mexico to the United States.\n\nThe new president, who takes office Saturday, has publicly discussed the idea of offering more Mexican work visas for Central American migrants and proposed working with the Trump administration to encourage private investment in southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, in an effort to encourage people to stay in their home countries.\n\nBehind closed doors, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s team is trying to persuade the Trump administration to secure about $20 billion in private investment over six years for Mexico\u2019s impoverished southern region as part of the deal that would allow Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico, according to Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Joe Biden Blasts Trump Administration's \u2018Charlatans And Demagogues\u2019", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-donald-trump-charlatans-demagogues_us_5c00ec51e4b0249dce737b72", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:44", "body_paragraphs": "Former Vice President Joe Biden bashed President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in a new video in which he explained the importance of international institutions and America\u2019s credibility in the world.\n\nBiden called out the Trump White House for breaking down international norms and rules established after WWII to keep peace and aid prosperity in the \u201cHere\u2019s The Deal\u201d segment shared online by media company ATTN: on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being attacked from within by the kinds of charlatans and demagogues who are eroding our democracy by attacking institutions like an independent judiciary, a free press,\u201d said Biden.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to pull back from the world,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a moment to lead boldly, not to coddle dictators from the Philippines to Russia.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "CNN's Chris Cuomo Expertly Picks Apart Donald Trump's Latest Batch Of Lies", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-cuomo-donald-trump-character-assassin_us_5c00e543e4b0d04f48b2b04e", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:45", "body_paragraphs": "CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo dissected President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on the newest guilty plea of his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen on Thursday night.\n\nThe \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d host said Cohen\u2019s admission he lied to Congress about negotiations over a Russian real estate deal marked \u201cthe biggest piece in a pattern of lying about what matters that uniquely defines this president.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we teach our kids and as Walter Scott explained perfectly, \u2019Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive,\u2019\u201d Cuomo concluded."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Women Sleep Better With Dogs Than With Human Partners, Study Says", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-sleep-better-with-dogs-than-with-human-partners-study_us_5c002dede4b0864f4f6b706f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:45", "body_paragraphs": "For the best sleep of your life, tell your partner to hightail it to the couch and cuddle up to Fido instead.\n\nLed by associate professor Christy L.

A committee of more than a dozen of those scientists released a consensus statement condemning He\u2019s \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d news. They also called for an independent review to assess exactly what he and his team had done.\n\nThe 2018 consensus statement also affirmed the summit\u2019s initial stance, first published in 2015, that genetic editing on sperm, egg or embryo cells that go on to become pregnancies is still too risky to attempt and that there are too many unknowns.\n\nWhat Is CRISPR-Cas9?\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 forms the basis of a tool used to make genetic alterations in DNA. It is not the world\u2019s first gene-editing tool, but it is the cheapest, easiest, most accessible and most accurate one to date.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 itself is a component of the immune systems of bacteria. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which is a mouthful of a term scientists use to describe particular types of DNA sequences present in bacterial genomes. These sequences act as genetic memory banks that bacteria use to protect themselves from invaders like viruses.\n\nThe first time a virus invades a bacterium, the bacterium stores a snippet of the virus\u2019s genome in its own and transcribes it into strands of RNA that will recognize the viral DNA if it invades again. In that case, those RNA strands direct special enzymes called CRISPR-assisted proteins (Cas) to the known DNA snippet in the invading virus. The enzyme goes to work to chop up the DNA, deactivating the threat.\n\nGenetic scientists harness this seek-and-destroy mechanism to make targeted changes in DNA. MIT scientist Feng Zhang, who was integral in developing CRISPR-Cas9 applications for use in plant, animal and human cells, compares CRISPR-Cas9 to a tool that can find and replace typos in a Word document. First, CRISPR finds the mistake that needs to be fixed, and then the enzyme Cas9 cuts it out and replaces it with a new word.\n\nTo use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit a strand of DNA in a cell or animal, a scientist first creates a small circle of DNA that includes the genetic code for bacterial Cas9 and instructions for the cell to produce many copies of the enzyme. She inserts that circle of DNA, called an expression plasmid, into the cell, along with another plasmid loaded with information about the genetic sequence she wants the Cas9 protein to find in the genome. This second plasmid will be transcribed into strands of RNA, which will guide the Cas9 enzymes to the target gene in the cell\u2019s DNA. Together, they find the targeted gene sequence and snip it out.\n\nDepending on the scientist\u2019s goals, she can either hope the cell takes it upon itself to repair the snipped DNA (leaving a double helix devoid of the targeted gene sequence), or she can inject a new strand of DNA that she wants the cell to use in place of the snipped DNA.\n\nThe uses for this genetic tool are practically limitless, said Josephine Johnston, director of research at The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute.\n\n\u201cIts potential applications are gigantic,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cThis is something that can be used in bacteria or fish or mosquitoes or farm animals or humans.\u201d\n\nTake wildlife conservation. Invading predator animals like rodents and possums have decimated New Zealand\u2019s vibrant and diverse local bird species. Conservationists in that country are excited about the possibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a genetic code into the rat population that would make it more difficult for them to reproduce, thereby driving down their numbers and giving the birds a chance to repopulate.\n\nPublic health researchers also wonder if they can use CRISPR-Cas9 to make it more difficult for mosquitoes to spread devastating diseases like malaria or Zika virus to human beings, either by making mosquitoes resistant to the disease itself or by simply altering their genetic code so that they stop reproducing altogether.\n\nBut with wide-ranging possibilities come serious concerns.\n\nThe Telegraph Scientist He Jiankui outraged the gene editing community with his announcement that he had used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit two embryos and then transferred them to become pregnancies.\n\nGenetic editing on sperm, egg or embryo cells, called germline editing, is what has the world\u2019s scientists and governments most concerned about this technology. This is because any alterations in these cells\u2019 genes will not only alter the DNA of that future person but the DNA of all of their future descendants, too. And because the technique is new, there\u2019s no telling what unforeseen consequences this could mean for genetically altered babies and the societies they live in.\n\nIn an interview with Boston public radio station WBUR, CRISPR pioneer Zhang explained some of the potential health problems these twin babies may encounter because of their altered genes.\n\nZhang said that CRISPR-Cas9 has been observed to occasionally edit genes that weren\u2019t the original target, so He may have altered more than he intended. There\u2019s also the fact that genes may sometimes play several roles, and an alteration to create one effect may have an unintended consequence in those other roles.\n\nFor instance, the AP story that first broke He\u2019s news notes that the gene he altered in the two embryos to make them resistant to HIV may also have made the children more prone to dying from the flu or getting West Nile virus.\n\nMany worry that using CRISPR-Cas9 for germline editing will lead to so-called designer babies, engineered with what Johnston called \u201csocially valuable traits\u201d like IQ or athletic ability.\n\n\u201cThere will be companies marketing those kinds of services in the future and it will be very difficult for prospective parents to navigate those offers,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s super important to be talking about this now and trying to flesh out the arguments for and against enhancement purposes.\u201d\n\nZhang called for a global moratorium on using the tool to create any more human embryos that will then be used in a pregnancy. The consensus statement is also clear that if scientists use CRISPR-Cas9 on human embryos, they shouldn\u2019t then be transferred to a woman to establish a pregnancy like He did.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to really cure some of these awful diseases that have plagued humanity for years. Debra Miller, Founder of CureDuchenne\n\nAs scary as its unintended consequences may be, if CRISPR-Cas9 research continues to the point where those kinds of safety issues are ironed out, Johnston believes that society will find it relatively easy to approve of gene editing techniques to cure serious diseases that have no other medical therapy. Indeed, most Americans already say that gene editing to cure or avoid a serious disease is an appropriate use of the tool.\n\nThe application that has most people excited is its potential use in people with rare and incurable genetic diseases. The hope: that CRISPR-Cas9 could be the key to a cure by simply editing out the origin of the problem.\n\nDebra Miller, CEO of the organization CureDuchenne, started the investment group after her son was diagnosed with Duchenne, a kind of muscular dystrophy caused by a defect in the gene responsible for producing the protein dystrophin. Without dystrophin, muscles slowly waste away, becoming weaker and more fragile.\n\nCureDuchenne has helped raise funding for research into the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to find the mutated gene and correct it. A paper on the use of this gene therapy in animals, published last October, found that this particular use of CRISPR-Cas9 restored dystrophin levels in the heart of one dog to 92 percent of normal levels.\n\nThis is significant because most people with Duchenne tend to die in their late teens or early 20s from either cardiac or respiratory failure. Miller\u2019s son is 21.\n\n\u201cCRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to really cure some of these awful diseases that have plagued humanity for years,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMany cancers are genetically driven, and single-gene disorders like Huntington\u2019s disease, fragile X syndrome and cystic fibrosis are either devastating or cause early death.\n\nMiller, whose son\u2019s life may depend on finding a gene therapy for Duchenne, fears that He\u2019s experiment on the twin girls will spark a global backlash against all uses of CRISPR-Cas9."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "How Mowing Overgrown Lots Reduced Shootings In Philadelphia Neighborhoods", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philadelphia-gun-violence-clean-and-green_us_5bfecac7e4b0e254c926c83b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:47", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS In Philadelphia, researchers have found that cleaning up and mowing vacant lots reduced shootings that resulted in serious injury or death.\n\nFixing up overgrown, vacant and blighted lots in Philadelphia did more than beautify neglected areas of the city. Those improvements reduced firearm shootings ending in serious injury or death, according to new research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not super costly. You can rely on locate local contractors and community groups to clean and green a lot. The cost of maintaining it is fairly low,\u201d said John MacDonald, one of the authors of the new research and a professor of criminology and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis cleaning-and-greening strategy may have the potential to save lives.\n\nGun violence isn\u2019t equally distributed across cities. Instead it\u2019s concentrated in neighborhoods or even city blocks. In aging deindustrialized cities like Philadelphia, those are often the same city blocks that have run-down and vacant lots.\n\nIn the new study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health this week, researchers worked with the Philadelphia Horticultural Society\u2019s LandCare program to give randomized blighted lots either a full remediation treatment \u2014 meaning they cleaned the lot, put down grass seed, erected a picket fence and then maintained the property \u2014 or a partial treatment involving trash pickup and mowing only. Then they measured shootings before and after the remediation using Philadelphia Police Department data between 2011 to 2015. Untouched blighted lots served as a control group.\n\n\u201cDoing the full intervention, or doing at least a partial intervention of mowing and picking up trash, you see a significant reduction in shootings,\u201d said MacDonald, noting that the full-treatment greened areas saw about a 7 percent reduction and the mowed areas saw about a 9 percent reduction.\n\nThe shootings didn\u2019t just relocate around the corner or a few blocks away, either. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any evidence that crime was displaced,\u201d MacDonald said. Instead, shootings in the surrounding area went down \u2015 not significantly \u2015 but enough to suggest that greening and cleaning might have some spillover benefits.\n\nWhile mass shootings garner headlines, the reality is that more routine urban gun violence makes up the majority of the 14,000 firearm homicides and tens of thousands of nonfatal shootings that happen in the U.S. every year. In Philadelphia, which has a higher homicide rate than New York or Los Angeles, there were 6,000 shootings between 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u2018Greening\u2019 Is Spreading To Other Cities\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania\u2019s latest study builds on years of research at the institution showing a link between remediating blighted urban spaces and reduced crime.\n\nThe relatively uncontroversial nature of cleaning vacant lots may make it an especially appealing option for cities with a combination of decaying vacant properties and gun violence.\n\nCities like Cincinnati, Houston and New Orleans have been inspired to start cleanup and maintenance programs of their own.\n\n\u201cIn the world of gun violence prevention for cities, there aren\u2019t a lot of options out there,\u201d Charles Branas, one of the authors of the new study, told PBS News Hour in 2017. \u201cThis is an apolitical option. The gun lobby has no opposition to this stuff. It\u2019s not in any way changing legal possession of firearms.\u201d\n\nMarc Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who has studied community greening in Flint, Michigan, said that while cleaning and greening might not be controversial in the gun control debate, it can spark a different controversy: fears about gentrification.\n\nStill, he thought the benefits outweighed the costs, at least in the short term. \u201cLiving in places with violence has all kinds of negative health consequences,\u201d he added.\n\nMacDonald noted the limitations of the intervention. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t green a city and just eliminate the chronic problems of gun violence that are highly concentrated in city blocks just by doing remediation to places,\u201d he said, but added that there are other reasons, including potential health and safety benefits, for remediating vacant spaces that extend beyond gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of intervention that I\u2019d like seen evaluated, but also done in cities across the country that have blight problems and vacant land problems,\u201d he said.\n\nA Different Kind Of \u2018Broken Windows\u2019 Philosophy\n\nWhile the researchers can\u2019t know for certain why the intervention worked, MacDonald explained that it\u2019s consistent with \u201cbroken windows theory,\u201d or the idea that there\u2019s a connection between abandoned and unkept property and crime.\n\nFewer signs of decay can change the functionality of a space. If, instead of avoiding an overgrown and vacant space, people are using it and the areas around it for get-togethers and social gatherings, surveillance improves. There\u2019s also a greater sense of social cohesion and more opportunity for the space to be used for socializing than for illegal activities.\n\nAlthough the term \u201cbroken windows\u201d is inextricably tied to the New York City Police Department\u2019s aggressive policing policy \u2015 where officers cracked down on petty crimes like vandalism and public urination in an effort to deter more serious offenses, and disproportionately targeted minorities in the process \u2015 the theory had a life before the NYPD co-opted it.\n\n\u201cA piece of property is abandoned, weeds grow up, a window is smashed,\u201d goes the famous \u201cBroken Windows\u201d article published in The Atlantic in 1982, co-written by a criminologist and a political scientist.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so striking is that the article was actually much more about broken windows than it was about bad people,\u201d said Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist and author of the book Palaces for the People, which explores how investing in social infrastructure can help restore civic life and fight inequality.\n\nBut law enforcement often neglects that nuance. Instead of focusing on improving abandoned properties, cutting weeds and literally fixing the broken windows cited in the article, policymakers jumped right to fighting crime, Klinenberg explained."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "How a Lawyer, a Felon and a Russian General Chased a Moscow Trump Tower Deal", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/trump-russia-felix-sater-michael-cohen.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-30 13:38:49", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Trump\u2019s effort in 2016 was only the latest episode in a long, sporadic quest dating to the 1980s. But as the Trump brand became increasingly common, emblazoning hotels and commercial towers around the world, a Russian equivalent never quite came together \u2014 even after Mr. Trump secured trademarks in the country and sent emissaries, including his children, to scout for deals.\n\nOne deal that almost got off the ground in 2005 \u2014 a Moscow tower on the site of a former pencil factory \u2014 was also pitched by Mr. Sater, an American citizen who immigrated as a child from Russia. He was working at the time for Bayrock Group, a development company that teamed up with Mr. Trump on several hotel projects in the United States.\n\nImage Mr. Sater tapped Evgeny Shmykov, a former general in Russian military intelligence, to help with the Moscow project.\n\nMr. Sater, who sometimes carried a business card identifying him as a \u201csenior adviser\u201d to Mr. Trump, pursued Russian deals throughout the 2000s. On one visit in which he was accompanied by Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, he arranged for Ms. Trump to sit in Mr. Putin\u2019s chair during a tour of the Kremlin, he said in emails to Mr. Cohen.\n\nMr. Sater drew on connections he had made in Russia in the late 1990s when he began secretly working for American intelligence agencies, which in turn helped reduce his penalty after a guilty plea in a $40 million securities fraud case. (He was previously convicted after slashing a man\u2019s face in a Manhattan bar fight in 1991.) He told the House Intelligence Committee last year that he had cultivated a network of foreign contacts that included \u201cranking intelligence, military operatives and military research facilities.\u201d\n\nOne of his contacts was Mr. Shmykov, who worked with anti-Taliban fighters in Afghanistan in the late 1990s and early 2000s while serving in Russian military intelligence, according to documents and online research.

Mueller III, were consistent with what Mr. Cohen said in court on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe president said there was a proposal, it was discussed with Cohen, there was a nonbinding letter of intent and it didn\u2019t go beyond that,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday.\n\nThe president\u2019s answers, submitted to the special counsel this month, have not been made public.

In 2016, Moscow was conducting a clandestine effort aimed at getting Mr. Trump elected, and Mr. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired in those efforts.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday as he left Washington for an economic summit meeting in Buenos Aires, Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen was weak and had lied to prosecutors so that he could get a reduced sentence for other crimes he has pleaded guilty to."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Louisiana School Made Headlines for Sending Black Kids to Elite Colleges.
