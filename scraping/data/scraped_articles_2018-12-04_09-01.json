Gen. Michael Flynn is pictured in November 2016 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nHe may also begin to add context and answers to some of the intriguing clues he has dropped in a probe that has so far seen three people sentenced, one convicted at trial and seven guilty pleas and has charged 36 people and entities with a total of 192 criminal counts.\n\nWith each twist of the investigation, a fascinating trove is building of hints and implied connections, odd coincidences and apparent shady links between key players that is crying out for explanation.\n\nIt is now clear that Mueller is building a layered narrative, starting at the edge of the drama, by first exposing Russian election interference and fingering the culprits in Moscow's spy agencies. He has bolstered his story with successful swoops against former Trump aides like Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates , showing their ties to pro-Russian figures in Ukrainian politics, in a case ostensibly about financial fraud in the dubious trade of international lobbying.\n\nThere has been speculation that he is trying to leave a detailed paper trail in public in case Trump manages to fire him in a power play or he is somehow constrained in his writing of a final report.\n\nThe continuum running through the investigation showing links between Trump's associates and businesses and Russia has been often subtle.\n\nBut it's increasingly hard to miss as Mueller plows into a new phase, one that is making it increasingly difficult for the President's defenders to claim that wrongdoing he has discovered unfolded far from the President's oblivious gaze.\n\nStepping up the pace of his probe since the midterm elections, Mueller has moved in a direction that appears increasingly threatening to the President, including his crossing of Trump's red line by showing interest in his family real estate empire.\n\nShifting gears\n\nSo far, as would be expected in an ongoing investigation, Mueller has not unveiled any allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia or that the President obstructed justice by trying to shut down the probe formerly overseen by fired FBI chief James Comey\n\nBut he is shifting up a gear following a week in which the Russia cloud enveloping the presidency darkened considerably.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cohen says he lied about project in Moscow Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cohen says he lied about project in Moscow 02:47\n\nTrump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said after entering a cooperation agreement with Mueller that he had lied to Congress to hide plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow that endured deep into the 2016 campaign.\n\nCNN reported that Cohen had originally believed Trump would pardon him for staying on message while talking with prosecutors. It is unclear who gave him that impression, but it raised perilous new questions for the President and his team.\n\nAnother branch of Mueller's investigation is also emerging -- his interest in alleged communications between Trump's informal political adviser Roger Stone and associate Jerome Corsi with WikiLeaks, the website that published emails stolen by Russian spies from the Clinton campaign's chairman and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMueller's methodical and increasingly visible activity seems to be playing on the mind of the President, who unleashed the latest in a flurry of angry tweet storms at the special counsel Monday.\n\n\"Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, don't want the truth, they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!\"\n\nFormer Donald Trump presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort is seen in October 2017 in the Bronx borough of New York City. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nIn Tuesday's scheduled filing about Flynn, Mueller is expected to reveal details of cooperation he obtained in a plea deal with the former general, who was constantly at Trump's side during the final stages of the 2016 campaign.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty last December to lying to the FBI about conversations about sanctions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was fired three weeks into Trump's presidency after news reports revealed the true nature of Flynn's conversations and the White House said he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the calls.\n\nFlynn's conduct could bring others with whom he worked in the transition and the White House to Mueller's attention, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Pence and ex-deputy national security adviser KT McFarland.\n\nIn the year since he was charged, Flynn has been a recluse, and mystery surrounds the scope of his cooperation with Mueller. Some of that intrigue could begin to clear on Tuesday.\n\nFriday's document dump on Manafort is also generating fierce anticipation.\n\nMueller's team will explain in district court in Washington why they accused Trump's jailed ex-campaign chairman of lying to them, potentially jeopardizing his cooperation deal with the special counsel.\n\nAll eyes will be on the court docket to see if Manafort lied about Russia or the Trump campaign -- which could be explosive -- or something with less collateral damage, like his lobbying work in Ukraine, which led to a conviction in Virginia for fraud and tax evasion.\n\nThe spokesperson for the special counsel's office has said that at least part of the Manafort memo will be public. Some of it could be sealed.\n\nOdd coincidences\n\nRussia investigation watchers are also on alert for movement on multiple other open loops and baffling questions not yet answered by Mueller.\n\nFor example, what is to become of Gates?\n\nRichard Gates arrives at the Prettyman Federal Court Building for a hearing November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nManafort's business partner turned against his former boss and helped Mueller seal a conviction. But the special counsel was not done with Gates, and said in a filing last month that Gates was still aiding \"several ongoing investigations.\"\n\nThat in itself was a danger sign for Trump, since Gates was around the campaign for far longer than Manafort.\n\nOne of the most beguiling twists in Mueller's investigation concerns Konstantin Kilimnik -- a Manafort business associate who was so obscure that it took news outlets months to find a photo of him.\n\nIn a March court filing, Mueller's team revealed that Kilimnik \"has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\" Not only that, but Kilimnik also was in contact with Manafort and Gates while they ran Trump's campaign. Kilimnik has already been charged by Mueller with witness tampering. Manafort was hit with the same obstruction charges and pleaded guilty in September.\n\nIf Mueller does eventually conclude that there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, it may turn out that Kilimnik was at the center of it.\n\nMueller also appears to be looking at a set of strange coincidences.\n\nHours after Trump publicly egged on the Russians to hack Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails in July 2016 -- Russian hackers apparently gave it their best shot, according to court filings. Mueller didn't connect the dots in his indictment of 12 Russian hackers, but he subtly noted that the attempted hack was \"the first time\" they had tried to breach Clinton's personal emails.\n\nThere was another example of suspicious timing in the Cohen indictment last week: Prosecutors revealed that Trump's fixer called off plans to visit Russia for the proposed Trump Tower Moscow deal on the exact day that first news reports emerged about Russia hacking the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAnd as Mueller continues circling Stone, evidence is mounting about his campaign season ties to WikiLeaks.\n\nDraft court filings obtained by CNN last week showed that Mueller's team has email evidence showing that Stone knew some details about the website's releases before they were public.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi?

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Throughout his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller has imposed on his team an ironclad rule: nobody leaks and nobody speaks -- out of court, that is. But when it comes to official court filings -- indictments, plea agreements, sentencing memos -- Mueller has been loquacious and at times downright chatty, disclosing in compelling narrative fashion crucial details about his investigation and tantalizing clues about what might happen next.\n\nThis week, Mueller is due to make three crucial court filings -- sentencing memos for Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Each document will tell us something important about what the future holds for these defendants and, more importantly, about what Mueller knows and where he might be headed. By the end of this week, we will know much more about the strength of Mueller's hand and the threat his investigation poses to President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\nMichael Flynn\n\nEver since his December 2017 guilty plea, Flynn has been something of a mystery man. Trump's former national security adviser, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn falsely told the FBI he had not asked Kislyak to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the outgoing Obama administration had imposed on Russia.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty via a cooperation agreement , which means that Mueller now knows everything that Flynn knows. Yet Mueller has not made any moves or brought any new charges that are obviously based on Flynn's cooperation.\n\nNow we should finally hear that story. Flynn is set for sentencing on December 18, and Mueller's sentencing memo is due this Tuesday, December 4. That submission should answer one fundamental question about Flynn: what the heck has this guy been up to? Does Flynn, who held high-level positions in the campaign and administration, know about crimes committed by members of Trump's team? Did Flynn consult with Trump or others on his conversations with Kislyak about Russian sanctions , or about Flynn's false statements to the FBI about those sanctions? Did Flynn speak with Trump about other foreign policy issues, and were Trump's positions ever improperly influenced? Has Mueller used Flynn's information in bringing charges against any others, or might we see additional charges forthcoming?\n\nOne thing is certain: much of the mystery surrounding Flynn, and his cooperation with Mueller, is finally about to be solved.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nCohen's sentencing memo , filed last week in the Southern District of New York (\"SDNY\"), lobbed two grenades in Trump's direction -- one right at him and another close by. The direct hit came in Cohen's assertion that he \"participated in planning discussions\" with Trump regarding hush money payments to Stephanie Clifford and Karen McDougal, and that Cohen paid Clifford \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump (as Cohen previously stated under oath when he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations).\n\nIf true -- and the Wall Street Journal recently published an investigative piece containing extensive corroboration for Cohen's contentions -- then Trump almost certainly participated in a violation of federal campaign finance law. When Cohen pleaded guilty, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said \"the President in this matter has done nothing wrong, and there are no charges against him.\"\n\nThe indirect damage arises from Cohen's assertion in the memo that he lied to Congress about the timing of Trump's efforts to build a tower in Moscow \"to support and advance (Trump's) political messaging.\" Cohen claims that he \"remained in close contact with White House staff and counsel to (Trump)\" about the Moscow project and his testimony to Congress. Cohen stops short of saying that he lied at Trump's direction or that he discussed his false testimony with Trump. Nonetheless, Cohen's false testimony to Congress poses political problems for Trump (who repeatedly and falsely denied that he had business dealings with Russia during a time when he plainly did, according to Cohen) and criminal problems for anyone in the White House who advised or encouraged Cohen to testify falsely. Anyone else who testified falsely to Congress about the timing of the Moscow project could be in Mueller's line of fire as well.\n\nThe big question remaining is whether Mueller will agree with Cohen's account of his own conduct. The smart bet is that he will. Cohen's lead attorney, Guy Petrillo, is a widely respected veteran of the SDNY with an impeccable reputation for candor. (Disclosure: Petrillo was a colleague and supervisor of mine at the SDNY). Petrillo knows how the cooperation process works; there is little chance he would make an assertion in a sentencing memo to a stern judge unless he knew that prosecutors would sign onto it.\n\nIf Mueller and the SDNY do concur with Cohen's version of the facts -- particularly on the campaign finance violation -- then we will have, officially, federal prosecutors stating on the record that the President has committed a federal offense -- causing an unlawful corporate campaign contribution and excessive campaign contribution.\n\nPaul Manafort\n\nThis one should be the main event. Last week, Mueller dropped a bombshell when he notified a federal judge that Manafort had breached his cooperation agreement by lying repeatedly to federal prosecutors and agents \" on a variety of subject matters .\" Mueller told the judge he would \"file a detailed sentencing submission ... in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the defendant's crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea agreement.\"\n\nMueller is due to file that sentencing memo by Friday, December 7, and it promises to be a barnburner. Mueller has promised to lay it all out: the specifics of Manafort's lies and the proof establishing the truth of the underlying matters. We do not yet know specifically what Manafort lied about, but we will learn this week.\n\nBased on my own experience as a federal and state prosecutor, cooperators most often get in trouble because they lie by omission. They leave out facts that would incriminate themselves, or others they want to protect. Cooperation in the federal system typically is all-or-nothing. Cooperators do not get to pick and choose what information they provide to prosecutors, or who they cooperate against -- and when they try to do so, the cooperation blows apart.\n\nFor more opinion...

He might have illicit money stashed away that he did not want to turn over to Mueller, or he might have committed other crimes that he did not want to admit. Both are common scenarios.\n\nManafort also likely failed to tell Mueller about crimes that other people committed. Cooperators do this for various reasons: personal or familial relationships, fear of reprisal, or a belief that they will be rewarded. By lying to Mueller, Manafort took a reckless gamble and put himself in a tenuous position. At 69 years old, he now faces a sentence likely to keep him locked up for the rest of his life. Whoever Manafort tried to protect, he believed it was worth it to take the risk of dying behind bars (or -- perhaps -- that that person might pardon him).\n\nWe know that Mueller knows Manafort lied, and we know that Mueller will prove those lies to the court \"in detail\" in his filing this week. We soon should know who Manafort tried to protect, what crimes those people committed with Manafort (or to Manafort's knowledge), and what proof Mueller has of those crimes. This is going to get interesting, and soon."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Ex-prosecutor: Trump 'right on the edge of witness tampering'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/B0gHGbJX8a4/trump-russia-mueller-investigation-stone-elie-honig-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump took to Twitter to lash out at special counsel Robert Mueller and attack his former personal attorney Michael Cohen.

The truth is very bad for their mission!\"\n\n\"He makes up stories.\" \"They only want lies.\"\n\nIt's fascinating that one of Trump's preferred lines of attack against his enemies also happens to be his greatest weakness/flaw: Telling the truth (or not). By now, everyone knows -- or should -- that Trump said more than 5,000 things in his first 601 days in office that were either totally false or misleading, according to a count maintained by The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog\n\nWhat's less known but of critical import is how many people who are (or have been) very close to Trump are now proven-beyond-any-doubt liars. Sharon LaFraniere of The New York Times (you might have heard of it) made that point in a hugely important piece over the weekend . Here's the key bit:\n\n\"If the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has proved anything in his 18-month-long investigation \u2014 besides how intensely Russia meddled in an American presidential election \u2014 it is that Mr. Trump surrounded himself throughout 2016 and early 2017 with people to whom lying seemed to be second nature.\n\n\"They lied to federal authorities even when they had lawyers advising them, even when the risk of getting caught was high and even when the consequences for them were dire.\"\n\nLaFraniere goes on to note that:\n\nMichael Flynn, Trump's one-time national security adviser, admitted to lying about his ties to Russia.\n\nRick Gates, Trump's deputy campaign chair, admitted to lying about his financial dealings in Ukraine.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, admitted to lying about his financial dealings in Ukraine -- and reportedly broke his plea deal by back-channeling information about the Mueller investigation to Trump's attorneys.\n\nCohen, Trump's one-time personal lawyer/fixer, admitted to lying to Congress about his conversations about a Trump Tower Moscow project\n\nAnd that is only the list of people around Trump who have lied with criminal penalties. As LaFraniere notes, Sean Spicer, Trump's first press secretary, made himself irrelevant in the eyes of the press corps on his first official day on the job when he insisted that Trump's inauguration crowd was the largest in history. And Spicer's replacement in the job -- Sarah Sanders -- has fared little better. That's to say nothing of White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, who famously/infamously created the phrase \"alternative facts\" in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nThe common thread here, the hub at the center of the wheel, is, of course, Trump.\n\nFrom The New York Times: \"'Mr. Trump looks for people who share his disregard for the truth and are willing to parrot him, 'even if it's a lie, even if they know it's a lie, and even if he said the opposite the day before,' said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. They must be 'loyal to what he is saying right now,' she said, or he sees them as 'a traitor.'\"\n\nThe way to rise in Trump's world is to tell the boss what he wants to hear. And what Trump wants to hear is that he is doing the exact right thing at all times -- and that those who argue any differently are losers and haters out to make him fail because they are jealous of his success.\n\nThat's a very dangerous proposition when the boss is Trump, because he spends most of his time telling himself a story of his life. In that story, he is always the hero, the genius, the best, the winner. Whether the story Trump tells himself comports with established facts is of little concern to the President. So if the way you ascend the ladder in Trumpworld is to tell him whatever he wants to hear -- truth be damned -- you have a whole lot of people enabling the most powerful person in the country to live in a fantasy world of his own creation.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump's down-is-up view of the Mueller investigation. Trump has convinced himself that the probe is illegal on its face because it was triggered by the purposeful leak of classified information by former FBI Director James Comey. That's not true on two counts: 1) We know the FBI investigation was triggered by former Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos when he bragged to an Australian diplomat that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton and 2) Comey has testified under oath that the memo he asked a friend to leak on his interactions with Trump was purposely written without any classified material in it.\n\nThen there's Trump's characterization of the Mueller investigation as nothing more than witch hunt conducted by Democratic partisans out to get him. The \"witch hunt\" idea is belied by, well, a lot of facts, including : 1) 192 criminal charges have been brought as a result of the probe 2) 36 individuals and entities have been charged 3) seven people have pleaded guilty 4) one person -- Manafort -- has been convicted by a jury of his peers and 5) three people have been sentenced to or have served jail time due to wrongdoing uncovered by the Mueller investigation.\n\nTrump's insistence that Mueller is some sort of rogue prosecutor with an ax to grind is, again, not backed up by facts. Mueller served as the FBI director for a decade -- nominated first by President George W. Bush and then by President Barack Obama. He was named special counsel in this investigation by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee. And, did I mention that Mueller himself has been a lifelong registered Republican? As for Trump's attacks on the \"13 Angry Democrats\" on the Mueller team, it's not clear where he's getting his numbers; nine of the 17 members of Mueller's team have donated to Democrats in the past, according to The Washington Post\n\nThose are all facts. They are the truth. That the President of the United States finds a way to disagree speaks to the level of staff-enabled fantasy in which he lives."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump praises Roger Stone for not testifying", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8oHYroqoRDQ/trump-praises-roger-stone-not-testifying-twitter-erin-burnett-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "In a series of tweets, President Trump said that Roger Stone, a Republican political operative and longtime Trump ally, has \"guts\" for saying that he won't testify against the President."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi's private WhatsApp messages may offer new clues to killing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/289NrOvdSDI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) In his public writings, Jamal Khashoggi's criticism of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was measured. In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.\n\nIn more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \"beast,\" a \"pac-man\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.\n\nCNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince.\n\n\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\"\n\nThis is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind.\n\nIs there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them\n\nArrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \"pac man\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows\n\nThe exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \"God help us,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo months later, he was dead.\n\nAbdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.\n\n\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \"The guilt is killing me.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSIM cards and financial support\n\nAbdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.\n\nIn almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following.\n\nThe digital offensive, dubbed the \"cyber bees,\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. \"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial $30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.\n\nIn one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\"\n\n\"Brilliant report,\" Khashoggi replies. \"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army\n\nJamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something.\n\nYou know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting.\n\nA month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first $5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up.\n\nBut in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.\n\n\"How did they know?\" asks Khashoggi in a message.\n\n\"There must have been a gap,\" says Abdulaziz.\n\nThree minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \"God help us.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe.\n\nJamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees?\n\nThe family's safety\n\nOmar Alzahrani I began to create groups\n\nI began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap\n\nTens of people must have been involved in this.\n\nCan you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees.\n\n!\n\nOtherwise I will go to prison\n\nJamal Khashoggi God help us.\n\nOmar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning.\n\nJamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective)\n\nDo not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram.\n\nThe 'hack'\n\nAbdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nMarczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.\n\nDanna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said.\n\nOn Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz.\n\nThe lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Monday, after the lawsuit was filed, NSO Group said it was \"completely unfounded\" and \"shows no evidence that the company's technology was used\" to hack Abdulaziz's phone. NSO also said its technology helps governments and law enforcement agencies \"fight terrorism and crime in a modern age\" and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government.\n\nThe statement added: \"The lawsuit appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work.\"\n\n\"In addition, products supplied by NSO are operated by the government customer to whom they were supplied, without the involvement of NSO or its employees.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington.\n\n'Tyranny has no logic'\n\nThe fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.\n\nThe messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.\n\n\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \"but tyranny has no logic.\"\n\nSuch discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing\n\nJamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament.\n\nAs Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.\n\n'Message from MBS'\n\nLast May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.\n\nSpeaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job.\n\n\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\" one of them says.\n\nAbdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.\n\nChillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qathani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"If Saud al Qathani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\" says one other man.\n\nThen they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.\n\nPoignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life.\n\n\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\"\n\nOn October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "ISIS threat closes US embassy in Democratic Republic of the Congo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/dFR0UHvhdsM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The US embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was closed after the US received intelligence that an ISIS-linked group could carry out attacks against US interests there, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nThe terror group is not believed to have a significant presence in the DRC and officials say it is believed that the operatives may have been planning to enter the DRC from outside the country.\n\nThe embassy had been closed since it received \"credible and specific information of a possible terrorist threat against US Government facilities in Kinshasa\" on November 24.\n\nThe embassy is expected to re-open to the public on Tuesday, according to a statement by the embassy.\n\nCutting US troops\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Spain's Vox party wins seats as far-right party surges for first time since Franco", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/lplj_LPDwks/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Madrid (CNN) A far-right party in Spain broke new political ground Sunday after winning 12 seats in a regional election for the first time since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.\n\nIn another sign that the far-right is gaining momentum in Europe, the Vox party gained its success in Andalucia, an area in the south of the country which has suffered with high unemployment and is one of the flashpoints for the country's battle with illegal immigration.\n\nIts success was lauded by French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, who tweeted : \"Strong and warm congratulations to my friends from Vox, who tonight in Spain scored a meaningful result for such a young and dynamic movement.\"\n\nVox has attracted voters with its hard line stance on illegal immigration, its opposition to Catalan independence and its calls for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain.\n\nIt could now find itself in a position as kingmaker with the ruling Socialist party failing to secure enough seats to command a majority.\n\nVox candidate for Andalusian regional Presidency, magistrate Francisco Serrano (C), reacts during an election night party in Seville/.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Qatar is pulling out of OPEC", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/30PQPFFtQ2g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Dubai (CNN Business) OPEC is losing one of its oldest members.\n\nThe small, gas-rich state of Qatar said Monday that it will leave the oil cartel on January 1 after nearly 60 years.

It marked one of the largest satellite ride-sharing missions ever launched and the most crowded single mission in US history, according to Spaceflight, SpaceX's customer for the launch.\n\nThe mission illustrated the growing demand to launch small satellites, modern devices that some companies hope will empower an array of new businesses \u2014 from internet service to supply chain monitoring.\n\nFor SpaceX, Monday's mission, called SSO-A, marked its 19th launch of 2018, surpassing its previous annual record of 18 launches last year.\n\nIt was also the first time Musk's company attempted to fly one of its rocket boosters for a third time. The booster, covered in black soot from its two prior flights, landed again on a remote controlled platform in the Pacific Ocean after launch, queuing up the rocket to fly for a fourth time.\n\nSpaceX's goal is to drastically reduce the cost of a launch by reusing the hardware, a feat its competitors long thought was impossible or uneconomical.\n\nThe latest version of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, called Block 5, is designed to fly as many as 100 times before retirement, and up to 10 times without significant refurbishment between flights.\n\nThe first-stage booster used for the SSO-A mission flew twice in the past six months \u2014 first on May 11 for the Bangabandhu mission and again August 7 for Merah Putih\n\nSpaceX also tried again Monday to recover the rocket's fairing , the bulging cone at the top of the rocket that shields satellites during launch. Musk has said the fairing costs about $6 million.\n\nThe company has tried on several occasions to guide the fairing, using parachutes, to a soft landing into a giant net hoisted up by a crew boat called Mr. Steven. But it has yet to hit the mark.\n\nMusk said in a tweet Monday that the fairing halves \"missed the net, but touched down softly in the water.\"\n\nExperts have told CNN Business that salt water can damage electronics and components inside the fairing, likely making the part unusable if it hits the ocean. But Musk said SpaceX will attempt to refurbish the nose cone.\n\n\"Plan is to dry them out & launch again,\" he said. \"Nothing wrong with a little swim.\"\n\nSatellite ride sharing\n\nSpaceX's customer for the SSO-A mission, Spaceflight, aims to be a sort of Uber service for space. The company has for years worked as a liaison between small satellite companies and launch providers, looking to put small payloads onto rockets with extra room on board.\n\n\"We started off just selling the excess capacity on whatever launches were out there,\" Spaceflight president Curt Blake told CNN Business in a recent interview. \"Then, we said, 'Wow demand is so big, we should just buy a whole rocket ourselves.' That's how this mission came to be.\"\n\nSSO-A was the first mission Spaceflight has filled a rocket entirely with its small satellite customers. They came from 34 companies and organizations across 17 countries.\n\nThey included Australia-based Fleet Space Technologies, which aims to connect remote devices to the internet via satellite. Two companies \u2014 US-based Capella Space Corporation and Finland's ICEYE \u2014 seek to use advanced radars to track airplanes or ships, even in cloudy weather. A group of middle school students from Florida sent an experimental astrobiology satellite. And an art project, funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, that pays homage to the first African American astronaut, Robert Henry Lawrence Jr., also took flight.\n\nDeploying all 64 satellites safely is tricky business. The devices, which span a variety of shapes and sizes, rode to space affixed to sides of a 20-foot-tall structure, called a payload stack, that was shielded by the Falcon 9's fairing during launch. Once in orbit, the fairing fell away, and the satellites popped off from the payload stack in a carefully orchestrated sequence.\n\nSpaceflight confirmed about seven hours after launch that all 64 satellites were deployed successfully.\n\nCrowded ridesharing missions like this one have been executed before. India's space agency last year shattered a world record by launching 104 small satellites with a single rocket. Another mission from Russia in 2014 deployed 37 satellites.\n\nSmallsats and space debris\n\nThere is a massive backlog of small satellites waiting to get to orbit. And companies including SpaceX and OneWeb are racing to send constellations of thousands of high-speed internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nWhile hitching a ride with larger payloads is considered the cheapest option for getting to space, many nascent rocket companies are promising lightweight rockets that can be mass produced and make cheap, frequent trips to orbit.\n\nOne such company, US-based Rocket Lab, became the first to reach orbit, and has notched two missions so far . Its backlog of customers is so long that CEO Peter Beck told CNN Business the company is \"not constrained by customers right now \u2014 we're only constrained by how quickly we can build rockets.\"\n\nThe massive influx of new satellites into low-Earth orbit poses difficult questions for the space sector, particularly when it comes to orbital debris"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Child killed when football team's bus crashes in Arkansas", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/c8nppUhzHkg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A bus crash early Monday killed one child and injured 45 other people, most of them children, when the driver lost control of the coach on Interstate 30 west of Benton, Arkansas State Police said.\n\nThe charter bus was carrying a youth all-star football team home from a championship game played over the weekend in Dallas.

And China said it would be willing to purchase a \"very substantial\" amount of agriculture, energy and other US products.\n\nStill, some analysts warned that the celebration on Wall Street could be short-lived. China and the United States now only have 90 days to sort out nagging trade issues that have been in contention for years, if not decades. And the statements that emerged from the trade meeting lacked concrete details.\n\n\"The beefiest part of Saturday evening's meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi may well have been the local sirloin served for dinner,\" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote to clients on Monday.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists said the most likely outcomes are that the truce gets extended after 90 days or that the trade war escalates. The investment bank sees just a 20% chance over the next three months of a comprehensive deal rolling back tariffs.\n\n\"The specter of higher and broader US tariffs remains,\" Goldman Sachs chief US political economist Alec Phillips wrote to clients on Sunday.\n\nIn any case, the progress on trade should allow investors to refocus on the fundamentals. But economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 because of the fading impact of the tax cuts, the impact of existing tariffs and higher borrowing costs.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Much has been written this year about women's anger -- its power and potential, its evolution and necessity. But beneath the analysis, there is the feeling itself: anger, pure and simple. It's what I felt when I read CNN's report about the destruction -- the outrageous, careless, wrongheaded, uneducated, ill-informed, dangerous, willful destruction -- of rape kits.\n\nI have been engaged in the work to bring an end to sexual violence since 2004, the year I started the Joyful Heart Foundation, which aims to heal and empower sexual assault survivors. But in truth, my work goes back even further -- to the moment I learned some of the statistics about sexual assault and domestic violence in preparation for my role on \"Law & Order: SVU.\"\n\nFor example, in the United States, one in three women and one in six men are survivors of sexual violence . One in four women and one in seven men have suffered severe violence from an intimate partner . Those numbers alone almost made my head explode.\n\nI had that feeling again when I first learned about the backlog of untested rape kits in 2009, after a report from Human Rights Watch . I couldn't wrap my mind around it: thousands of rape kits sitting, in some cases rotting, in police storage facilities across the country.\n\nAs Polly Poskin, executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, has said, \"If you've got stacks of physical evidence of a crime, and you're not doing everything you can with the evidence, then you must be making a decision that this isn't a very serious crime.\" Beyond the obvious threat to public safety, beyond the wasted opportunities to both prosecute the guilty and exonerate the wrongly convicted, the backlog sends a devastating and inexcusable message to survivors: You don't matter. What happened to you doesn't matter.\n\nAnd if the backlog wasn't enough, the destruction of rape kits now brings our country's attitude toward sexual assault and its victims into even sharper focus. Explore CNN's investigative report and you will learn about 99 agencies in 47 states destroying rape kits. About a detective in North Carolina who authorized the trashing of a rape kit a month after it was collected from a woman who was gang raped because the investigator didn't believe her. And about records showing kits were trashed as recently as 2016 -- with one of the objectives being to \"make space in the evidence room.\"\n\nThat is an outrageous, shameful level of disregard, and the system that makes it possible must change. Just as the backlog is a reflection of how we regard sexual assault and its victims in this country, the individual actions and decisions by law enforcement are the outcome of deeply entrenched societal attitudes that make those actions and decisions possible. Those attitudes must be dismantled.\n\nAnd what must change are the laws governing the handling of rape kits.\n\nAs CNN reports, last year the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations for best practices about the counting, tracking and testing of rape kits, reforms that the federal government agrees are needed. In order to be able to hold jurisdictions accountable, those recommendations must become law in all 50 states. Legally requiring the testing of rape kits and prohibiting the destruction of rape kits ensures that every survivor gets the same standard of care and rights. Importantly, each survivor should also have the right -- by law -- to know the status of their rape kit and have the option of having it preserved for as long as they want.\n\nIt is important to note that systemic and lasting change takes effect through state-level legislation. While agency, local, and county-level reforms are vital, we know that perpetrators do not stop at the county limits, and survivors' access to justice should not be restricted by zip code.\n\nProgress has already been made, to be sure. In the last two years alone, we and our partners have helped pass 34 laws to change the way rape kits are handled and are already working on legislation for 2019. Through endthebacklog.org , the first and only comprehensive online hub for information about the rape kit backlog in the United States, we are sharing best practices, progress on reform and a way for people to join this growing effort.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI also had the great privilege of telling survivors' stories who have kits in the backlog in \"I Am Evidence,\" the documentary I produced in partnership with HBO, which continues to be shown in communities across the country.\n\nIn the work to bring this violence to an end -- that is the vision to which we must commit -- stark reminders, like this important report from CNN, confront us with how much work is left to be done. While the report's content angers me deeply, perhaps that anger is not pure and simple. It also contains a renewed resolve, a reminder of how much is at stake in our work, and a deepened determination to create the more just society we all seek."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "See moment in courthouse when earthquake hits", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/0uK_Blw22fE/alaska-earthquake-hide-in-courthouse-nr-vpx.ktva", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The nation honors President George H.W.

Bush will be eulogized by his son, former President George W. Bush, along with a mix of family and friends on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral, the most high-profile event in a week of proceedings that will remember the remarkable life of the president who died on Friday at 94.\n\nAlong with his son, George H.W. Bush will be eulogized by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose time in power overlapped with Bush, former US Sen. Alan Simpson, who became a close friend to Bush, and presidential historian Jon Meacham, the late president's biographer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will not speak at the funeral, sources with knowledge of the plans tell CNN, but has said that he will attend Wednesday's memorial. Despite the fact that Trump's rise to power included lambasting past presidents, including both Bushes, the President has responded to Bush's death with repeated laudatory comments.\n\nThe plans for Bush's funeral were all put into place before Trump was ever elected, sources tell CNN. Presidents are traditionally asked to eulogize presidents who have died -- and in past state events like this, that has been the case -- but the Bush family is unlike any other and has another president in the family who will fill that role.\n\nTrump will pay a condolence call to the Bush family on Tuesday at Blair House, according to the sources, a government house across the street from the White House.\n\nAs of Monday morning, all living Presidents are expected to attend Bush's funeral on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are all expected to attend the service, according to sources familiar with the planning of the funeral. The current and all former first ladies are also expected to attend, except for Rosalynn Carter, according to the sources.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will also attend the funeral, an aide to Biden confirms.\n\nBush's passing has led to an outpouring of remembrances for the humble and gentlemanly statesman, whose life and service was seen to stand in direct contrast to the vitriol and partisanship that has enveloped elected politics in recent years. Many have also heralded Bush's 73-year marriage to his wife, Barbara Bush, who died months before her husband in April 2018.\n\nThose reflections will continue throughout the week, when Bush's casket travels from Houston, Bush's hometown, to Washington, DC to lie in state in the United States Capitol. Trump directed the presidential plane -- called Air Force One when the sitting President is aboard -- to pick up Bush's casket and transport it to Washington.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina where he was attending the G20 summit. \"So, we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBush will lie in state until Wednesday morning when his casket will then be transported to the National Cathedral for the first of two funeral services for the former president.\n\nVice President Mike Pence will offer brief remarks Monday at the evening ceremony at the Capitol before the public can visit the president lying in state. It is anticipated that foreign leaders will also be paying condolence calls to the family on Tuesday.\n\nThe German government press service announced Monday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will fly to Washington, DC, to take part in the memorial service for the late president, who oversaw the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany.\n\nOn Thursday, Bush's casket will travel back to Houston, where he will be memorialized at St. Martin's Episcopal Church and eulogized by his grandson, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, and former Secretary of State James Baker, a man who has been by Bush's side since the former president's failed 1970 Senate campaign in Texas.\n\nMembers of the family, including children and grandchildren, will be taking part in each service.\n\nBush's personal relationship with his Secret Service details will also be on full display throughout the week of events. The detail, made up of agents who enjoyed a close relationship with the former President, will be with him until he is interred and in the second vehicle in the motorcades that will lead to all the ceremonies.\n\nSome of the agents will also act as honorary pallbearers in Texas at the funeral home and Ellington Field, where Bush will begin his final flight back to Washington, DC.\n\nThe honorary pallbearers in Washington -- for both Bush's entry into the Rotunda and the National Cathedral -- will be Navy captains and admirals who have commanded the USS George H.W. Bush and members of the carrier strike group.\n\nBush's death has also led to a series of symbolic moments.\n\nBush had come to be known in recent years for his colorful and symbolic use of socks, wearing different pairs to express his mood or mark occasions. Jim McGrath, Bush's spokesman, tweeted on Monday that the 41st President \"will be carried to his final rest wearing socks that pay tribute to his lifetime of service, starting as an 18 year-old naval aviator in war.\"\n\nMcGrath also tweeted a photo of Sully, Bush's service dog, laying in front of the late President's casket on Sunday night with the caption, \"Mission Complete.\"\n\nSully is named after former airline pilot Chesley B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger III, who became famous for landing a damaged passenger jet on the Hudson River and saving all 155 passengers and crew in 2009.\n\nFollowing the week of services, Bush will be laid to rest on his presidential library grounds at Texas A&M University, where his wife and Robin, his daughter who died of leukemia in 1953, are buried."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "'Mission complete': Sully the service dog to accompany Bush one last time", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nqFKdp1IFz0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Sully, a yellow Labrador service dog who worked with late former President George H.W.

Springsteen is an outspoken liberal; he campaigned for John Kerry in 2004 and performed at Barack Obama's second inauguration\n\nWhat IS a big surprise is what Springsteen told the Sunday Times in an interview in advance of the release later this month of his long-running Broadway show on Netflix.\n\n\"I don't see anyone out there at the moment ... the man who can beat Trump, or the woman who can beat Trump,\" Springsteen said of the potential 2020 Democratic field. \"You need someone who can speak some of the same language [as Trump] ... and the Democrats don't have an obvious, effective presidential candidate.\"\n\nWhich is an interesting analysis -- particularly when you consider that the Democratic field is likely to be the largest in modern American history, with two dozen (or more) candidates expected to run. One would think that, given the expected size of the field, there would be at least one candidate -- and maybe a few -- who Springsteen believes can take on and beat Trump.\n\nAnd Springsteen's specific doubt about the Democratic field -- \"you need someone who can speak some of the same language\" as the President -- is a very important one.\n\nDismiss Springsteen as just another liberal rock star if you will (and he is!), but also remember that Springsteen's roots are in a working-class, blue-collar community -- and that he has spent his entire life writing about and trying to explain the hopes, fears and anxieties of those communities to the country and the world.\n\nTrump spoke to those fears and hopes in a very direct and real way during the 2016 campaign. He won the White House thanks to victories in the industrial Midwest -- Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio -- that was hit the hardest by the rapidly changing 21st-century economy and the crushing blows it dealt to the manufacturing sector.\n\n\"Donald J. Trump won the presidency by riding an enormous wave of support among white working-class voters,\" concluded The New York Times' Nate Cohen the day after the 2016 election. Trump won white, non-college educated males 71%-23% over Hillary Clinton and white, non-college educated women 61% to 34%, according to exit polling . Those white, non-college educated voters comprised one-third of the overall electorate. (\"Non-college educated,\" of course, doesn't equal \"blue-collar,\" but history has shown there are strong similarities among those groups and their voting preferences.)\n\nThere is zero question -- particularly when you consider the crushing blow Democrats delivered to Republicans in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms -- that Trump's path to a second term relies heavily on these same blue collar whites who got him elected President in the first place.\n\nAnd like it or not, Trump does, as Springsteen notes, understand how to not only talk to this group but convince them that he is their champion, that he is a voice for the previously voiceless. This, from Trump's inauguration speech , captures that sentiment nicely:\n\n\"January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\n\n\"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\n\"Everyone is listening to you now.\n\n\"You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\"\n\nTrump makes this appeal by casting himself as a man of the people -- fighting against elite snobbery and political correctness. (Yes, I am well aware of the irony of a man born into wealth and raised in New York City emerging as the voice of the working class.)\n\n\"Why are they elite?\" Trump asked a crowd at a rally in Minnesota over the summe r. \"I have a much better apartment than they do. I'm smarter than they are. I became president and they didn't. And I'm representing the best people on earth, the deplorables.\"\n\nLooking through that lens -- as Springsteen is doing -- you can understand the rocker's concerns. Kamala Harris, the current frontrunner in the 2020 rankings I do with Harry Enten , is a senator from California. Elizabeth Warren is an unapologetic liberal from Massachusetts. Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist from Vermont.\n\nNone of that group has an obvious appeal to blue-collar white workers that would trump Trump's -- at least at first glance.\n\nThat said, I do think there are candidates in the field -- or potential field -- who would fit more of what Springsteen is looking for. Former Vice President Joe Biden has practically changed his middle name to \"Hardscrabble roots in Scranton.\" And Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is the sort of gravel-voiced populist that might appeal to Bruce. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is not nearly as well known as Biden and Brown but has a similar pitch -- that Democrats need to start reaching Midwesterner voters, especially white working class ones, again.\n\nThe question before Democrats, to my mind, is not whether they have a candidate -- or candidates -- who can fight Trump for white blue-collar voters in the Midwest by speaking some of the \"same language\" as Trump, to borrow Springsteen's phrasing. The question is whether the party's base, which is increasingly coastal, non-white and liberal, wants to even consider a candidate like that as the party's standard-bearer against Trump.\n\nIf 2018 is any indication, they don't. No matter what Springsteen thinks."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "After a mysterious illness paralyzed her son, mom turned to polio survivors for answers", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/T4jj2WJW5RY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "It was 2012, and her 1-year-old son, Lucian, had suddenly become paralyzed from the waist down. While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.\n\nBut that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.\n\nEven on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.\n\nThen, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.\n\nOlivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.\n\nThe members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.\n\nAFM and polio: eerie similarities\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPolio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, according to the CDC . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.\n\nThanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been polio free since 1979 , according to the CDC.\n\nBut there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.\n\nSome have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAfter the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.\n\nThe socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.\n\n\"That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight,\" she said. \"They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Polio-like illness AFM 'appears to have peaked' in US for the year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ytQMolddxHw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The number of cases of the polio-like illness acute flaccid myelitis \"appears to have peaked\" for 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.\n\nIn its weekly update on cases of the illness, the agency said there have been 134 confirmed cases in 33 states this year.

As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said. There needs to be more peer-led outreach and services, as government services will not reach vulnerable people in such political climates.\n\nTanzania's Ministry of Health and a government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'They are making us fear, like we are not human beings'\n\nPeople involved in peer programs in Tanzania risk abuse but believe that in their work to help and educate people about the importance of HIV prevention as well as living with the condition, in addition to ensuring that they know their rights -- keeping them out of prison and away from the risk of infection.\n\n\"People are not free,\" said Faki, whose name has been changed to ensure his safety. The government is \"making us fear, like we are not human beings.\"\n\nFaki has been openly homosexual for just a few years, having gained the courage to come out through attending training and information sessions with local community groups.\n\nTwo years ago, he and two fellow activists formed an organization to work primarily with LGBT groups on his home island of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam, he says, his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police. His work has gotten him arrested too, he said.\n\n\"We have no support anymore,\" he said.\n\n, Faki helped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while Just a few days after Makonda's announcement for local task forces in Dar es SalaamFakihelped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while on local Pongwe beach , he said. They were reported by the driver who took them there. Amnesty International also reported the arrests.\n\nAt the same time, Faki had another LGBT friend come to stay with him, in hiding from Dar es Salaam, he said.\n\nThough his goal in life is to make LGBT people aware of their rights to make them confident about their sexuality in public and in the face of aggressive law enforcement, he also worries about the health of this community.\n\nAccess is a core issue, and another prohibitive factor is the attitude of health care workers at clinics, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf people find out you're gay, they're not friendly, he said, adding that if people do go to clinics for care, they can't be free and explain themselves or their situation, causing extra problems and \"contributing to the spread of HIV.\"\n\nHe is not hopeful about his island's or country's future.\n\nGlobal outcry in response to Mankonda's announcement has calmed the situation somewhat in Dar es Salaam and nationwide, but not entirely.\n\n\"People don't want to change their mindset on this issue,\" Faki said, referring mainly to government leaders.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J. Phillip King, a professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate.\n\nThe federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100.\n\nnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToday, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. Studies have found that treated water is, in fact, less likely to have contaminants than untreated river or lake water.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEfforts by other municipalities in Texas and California to use \"direct potable reuse\" haven't always gotten off the ground because of the \"ickiness\" factor. Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink.

He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water.\n\nConcerned about the potential health effects for his family, including his two daughters, he ran for a seat on the local water board.\n\nWhat drives him, Tiser said, is \"being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them.\"\n\nYears of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground, Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them.\n\n\"We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at,\" he said.\n\nIt's what Edwards calls America's \"dirty little secret.\" He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix, leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system.\n\nIn his wife's minivan, complete with acid stains on the carpet, Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations, and slowly being forgotten. \"It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car, because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those.

But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right?

However, neither side could withdraw from it without the other's consent.\n\nMr Cox accepted that signing up to it was a \"calculated risk\" but added: \"I do not believe we will be trapped in it permanently.\"\n\nHow the debate will work\n\nMPs will debate different aspects of the agreement, signed last month with EU leaders after months of wrangling, before voting on 11 December,\n\nSenior ministers are being lined up to make the case for it.\n\nThe first day of debate will be closed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay\n\nThe second day, on Wednesday, will focus on security, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid opening the debate and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt closing it\n\nThursday's debate will be on the economy, with Chancellor Philip Hammond opening it and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox winding up\n\nFurther details have still to be announced but Mrs May will kick off proceedings by telling MPs: \"The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit vote: Will MPs back deal in Commons?\n\nMrs May will argue her Brexit deal delivers on her commitments to end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.\n\nIt will leave Britain \"as a globally trading nation, in charge of our own destiny and seizing the opportunities of trade with some of the fastest-growing and most dynamic economies across the world\", she will add.\n\nMrs May will say future trade talks with Brussels will also ultimately result in \"a new free-trade area with no tariffs, fees, quantitative restrictions or rules-of-origin checks - an unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has\".\n\nLabour is threatening a vote of no confidence in the government as part of a move to trigger a general election, if Mrs May is defeated on 11 December.\n\nThe party is in favour of Brexit but against Mrs May's deal, which it argues will harm industry and cost jobs. It wants to delay Brexit to negotiate a better deal with Brussels."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46428579", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ECJ Image caption The case was heard by the full court of European judges last week\n\nThe UK should be able to unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU, according to a top European law officer.\n\nThe non-binding opinion was delivered by the the European Court of Justice's advocate general.\n\nA group of Scottish politicians has asked the court whether the UK can call off Brexit without the consent of other member states.\n\nThe Court of Justice (ECJ) will deliver its final ruling at a later date.\n\nThe advice from advocate general Manual Campos Sanchez-Bordona comes as the House of Commons begins five days of debates on Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal, with a vote due to be held next Tuesday.\n\nIn a written statement, the ECJ said Mr Campos Sanchez-Bordona believes that if a country decides to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty, and without needing the consent of the other 27 member states.\n\nWhile the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings.\n\nThe anti-Brexit politicians and campaigners who have brought the case hope it will give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve Mrs May's draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit.\n\nThe ECJ statement said the advocate general had proposed that the \"ourt of Justice should declare that Article 50 allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU.\n\n\"That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "France fuel protests: PM Philippe 'to halt fuel tax rise'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46437904", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:18", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests?\n\nThe French government will suspend a fuel tax rise which has led to weeks of violent protests, local media report.\n\nThe protests have hit major French cities causing considerable damage for the past three weekends.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe sought compromise with the protesters, but they called off talks citing death threats from extremists in their ranks.\n\nThe \"gilets jaunes\" (yellow vests) protests have now grown to reflect more widespread anger at the government.\n\nThree people have died since the unrest began and the resulting violence and vandalism - notably when statues were smashed at the Arc de Triomphe last Saturday - have been widely condemned.\n\n\"Yellow vests\" are so called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law.\n\nThe movement has grown via social media and has supporters across the political spectrum.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron was elected two years ago with an overwhelming mandate for sweeping reform, but his popularity has fallen sharply in recent months.\n\nMr Macron has accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block the reforms.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Macron (L) had vowed no capitulation to street protests\n\nMacron's difficulty\n\nBy Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris\n\nThe protesters have been waiting for the president to enact the next step in the elaborate pas-de-deux which is French social negotiation.\n\nWhat the ritual requires now is a gesture from the government that shows that it has not just listened, but that it is prepared to appease.\n\nThat is how, since time immemorial, French social conflicts have been resolved.\n\nThe difficulty for Emmanuel Macron is that this is exactly the kind of capitulation to the street that he has vowed to stop.

Then Hafizullah Rahimi, the head of Afghanistan's Olympic committee, made a surprising statement to reporters in Kabul.\n\n\"Sadly, these sorts of concerns have reached us,\" he said. \"Sexual abuse does exist, not only within the Football Federation but in other sports federations as well. We have to fight it.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Former captain Khalida Popal says men have destroyed the team\n\nIt's the first formal acknowledgement that persistent allegations made by former members of the women's national football team of rampant abuse by male coaches and others in positions of power may be credible.\n\nMany of the allegations have come from Khalida Popal, a former captain of the Afghan women's national football team who also served as its programme director. She risked her life as a teenager to play football in secret - when Afghanistan was still under Taliban rule. In order not to get caught she and her friends played in silence so the Taliban guards on the other side of the school wall wouldn't hear them.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC from Denmark, where she has lived since 2011, after fleeing death threats in Afghanistan, she said she had witnessed first-hand widespread physical and sexual abuse of girls and young women by coaches and federation officials. Girls complained to her about a range of abuse, from rape to sexual touching and harassment.\n\nShe says she almost lost hope of anything being done about it after she started to document abuse by two coaches. She took her findings to the Afghan Football Federation several years ago.\n\n\"Instead of removing them or punishing them\", she said, \"they were promoted.\"\n\nSome of the key culprits, she claims, are powerful figures in Afghanistan with close links to government. Officials in the federation would tell players that they could get them on the team list and give them money if they had sex with them, she said.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to several young women still living in Afghanistan - including some athletes from sports other than football - who tell similar stories of sexual harassment and bullying. They say the abuse often happened when they were competing to get a place in the national team or for the chance to train or play overseas. One says she was told: \"Show me how beautiful you are because only beautiful girls will get on the team.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The team's first game was against international troops\n\nThe allegations about the women's football team have particular resonance because it was earlier celebrated internationally as a symbol of a new, more liberal Afghanistan - and a showcase for the freedoms enjoyed by girls and young women after the fall of the Taliban in 2001.\n\nThe fact that the football stadium in Kabul where the team trained was once the venue for Taliban executions only emphasised the contrast.\n\nThe irony isn't lost on Khalida Popal. When she was the football team's programme director, she recruited American female coaches and many Afghan women from the diaspora. The Afghan women, she said, \"dreamed of doing something for their country, of supporting their sisters back in Afghanistan, of developing a strong national team that represents a positive image of the women of Afghanistan\".\n\n\"But unfortunately men tried to destroy our programme.\"\n\nShe says that since her allegations were published on Friday in The Guardian newspaper, she's heard from a dozen men and women who have thanked her for speaking out, some tearfully, and said they had similar experiences but were too frightened to come forward.\n\n\"I know my voice can change so many lives,\" she told me. \"I know my voice can change the system.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Afghan Service."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Theresa May to open five days of crunch debate", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46435128", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:00:35", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May is preparing to sell her Brexit deal as she opens five days of debate in the Commons.\n\nThe debate is due to last eight hours each day and to begin mid-afternoon.

Sanchez-Bordona believes that if a country decides to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty, and without needing the consent of the other 27 member states.\n\nWhile the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings.\n\nThe anti-Brexit politicians and campaigners who have brought the case hope it will give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve Mrs May's draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit.\n\nThe ECJ statement said the advocate general had proposed that the \"ourt of Justice should declare that Article 50 allows the unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU.\n\n\"That possibility continues to exist until such time as the withdrawal agreement is formally concluded.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category":

diagnosed special educational needs in England is a \"national scandal\", Ofsted has said.\n\nChief inspector of England's schools, Amanda Spielman, reveals 2,060 children with official education, health and care plans (EHCs) setting out their needs receive no support at all.\n\nShe also raises the issue of children disappearing from education.\n\nSome parents said a child is only assessed when they are excluded.\n\n'Disturbing'\n\nMs Spielman says: \"Too often, children who have been assessed still do not receive the services they need.\"\n\nShe uses her annual report to expose what she describes as a \"bleak picture\" of too many children \"failed by the education system\".\n\n\"In 2017, more than 4,000 children with an approved EHC plan received no provision, five times more than in 2010.\n\n\"One child with Send [special educational needs and disability] not receiving the help they need is disturbing enough, 2,060 is a national scandal.\"\n\nThe report also says: \"Most disconcerting is that the whereabouts of some of our most vulnerable children is unknown.\"\n\nIt revisits serious concerns that some pupils are being moved off the school roll illegally, because they may be seen as difficult to teach.\n\nThe report suggests 10,000 pupils cannot be accounted for and may have been \"off-rolled\" by schools in Years 10 and 11, because they did not appear on the pupil list of another state school.\n\nIt acknowledges many of these may have switched to independent schools, moved elsewhere or have been taken out for home schooling.\n\nBut, it says, it is unlikely that all of this number would fit into these categories.\n\nBattle for support\n\nThe report says that compounding the difficulties faced by children with Send and their parents is that demand for EHC needs assessments from local authorities has risen by a half since 2015.\n\nIn 2017, 45,200 children and young people were assessed, while 14,600 were refused an assessment.\n\nEHC assessments and plans were introduced in 2014 amid a shake-up designed to streamline and reduce the burden on the special needs education system.\n\nThey replaced statements of special educational needs which were carried out by local authorities.\n\nMany parents complained of the long and difficult battles they had to get their child's needs \"statemented\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBut campaigners say the same issues are being faced with EHCs.\n\nAt the same time, the costs of supporting more children with lower levels of special needs were handed back to schools, which have been facing budget pressures of their own.\n\nThere was also a stated intention to reduce the number of children diagnosed with lower levels of special needs.\n\n'Truly wrong'\n\nSome believe these are part of the reasons the EHC assessment and plan system has come under pressure.\n\nBoth local councils and head teachers have been grappling with huge rises in demand for high needs support - those children with the highest level of need.\n\nThe report says: \"Too often, the identification of Send is inaccurate or comes too late. This only exacerbates children's needs and puts even greater strain on the need for services.\n\n\"Often the worst hand is dealt to those who do not quite meet the threshold for an EHC plan.\n\n\"Understandably, parents feel that to do the best for their children they must go to extreme lengths to secure an EHC plan, which not every child will need.\n\n\"Something is truly wrong when parents repeatedly tell inspectors that they have to fight to get the help and support that their child needs. That is completely contrary to the ethos of the Send reforms.\"\n\nLast month, representatives of local authorities told MPs of the funding problems they face in their high needs budgets.\n\nSurrey County Council revealed it faced \u00a330m in pressures on its high needs budget for this year, adding this was enough to trigger formal restrictions on any further spending at the council.\n\nHas your child missed out on support for special education needs?

They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already \"a matter of life and death\" for many countries.\n\nHe explained that the world is \"nowhere near where it needs to be\" on the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nBut the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to \"right the ship\" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal'\n\nWhat's so different about this meeting?\n\nThis Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October.\n\nThe IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030.\n\nBut a recent study showed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action.\n\nThey say \"decisive action in the next two years will be crucial\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\n\nMeanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider.\n\nSo urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start.\n\nWill global leaders be attending?\n\nYes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting.\n\nThe number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment.\n\nBut for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical.

Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action.\n\n\"We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,\" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF.\n\n\"Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast.\"\n\nWhy is the UN process slow-moving?\n\nThere is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians.\n\nImage copyright HANNA FRANZEN Image caption Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24\n\n\"Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues.\n\n\"Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture.\"\n\nOthers involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world.\n\n\"We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nHow much of a role will money play in making progress in Poland?\n\nMany developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nSome are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting.\n\n\"A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\nAre there concerns the meeting is in a country reliant on coal?\n\nYes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many.\n\nThe Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia.\n\nThis bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.\n\nWill President Trump and the US feature at all?\n\nAlthough the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24.\n\nHowever, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels. A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates.\n\nUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018\n\nThe summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

All of the new detections come from the second period of operation, which ran for nearly nine months from November 2016 to August 2017.\n\nIn the catalogue, they are given the \"GW\" prefix, for \"Gravitational Waves\", followed by the date (yr/month/day) of occurrence: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818 and GW170823.\n\nSkip Youtube post by SXS Collaboration Warning: Third party content may contain adverts Report End of Youtube post by SXS Collaboration\n\nGravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time\n\nImage copyright NSF Image caption The LIGO Louisiana lab has 4km-long pipes running out from its control centre\n\nGravitational waves are a prediction of the Theory of General Relativity\n\nIt took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them\n\nThey are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events\n\nAccelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light\n\nDetectable sources include merging black holes and neutron stars\n\nLIGO/VIRGO fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light\n\nDetecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations\n\nWhat of the uncertain candidate?\n\nThe advanced laser labs in Washington and Louisiana began their first science run in September 2015 and almost immediately made the historic detection of a black hole merger on 14 September (GW150914), a discovery that would later earn a Nobel Prize.\n\nBut less than a month later, the alarms triggered again at the lab to raise the possibility of a second detection. At the time, scientists didn't think this event met the necessary criteria for a confident discovery, and so they labelled it LVT151012, where LVT stood for \"LIGO-VIRGO Trigger\".\n\nIt was frequently mentioned in communications, but could not really be counted in the catalogue of full detections.\n\nThis has now changed following the re-analysis. The criteria are met and the LVT prefix is replaced with GW.\n\nProf Christopher Berry at Northwestern called GW151012 a \"Cinderella story, a quiet signal that could\".\n\nWhat do these extra detections mean?\n\nThe hunt for gravitational waves is a game of statistics.\n\nFrom the number of detections so far made, scientists can extrapolate the likely number of black holes in a given volume of space.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Officials said the U.S. District Court and the attached federal building in Anchorage will be closed at least through Thursday following a preliminary evaluation by the General Services Administration.\n\nGSA spokesman Chad Hutson said boilers in the federal building were leaking, leaving it without heat.\n\nThe nearby Historic Federal Building, where the bankruptcy court is located, also remained closed. Officials said it will be ready to reopen once minor cleanup is complete.\n\nSchools have been closed until Dec. 10, which should also reduce traffic. An elementary school in the Anchorage suburb of Eagle River has been deemed unsafe to occupy, while multiple other campuses in the region are undergoing repairs and cleanup, according to the Anchorage School District.\n\nA middle school in the small town of Houston north of Anchorage likely will remain closed through the year.\n\nThe supply chain of food and other goods delivered to the Port of Anchorage from the Lower 48 has not been disrupted.\n\nAbout 90 percent of all the goods sold in Alaska are delivered to the Port of Anchorage, where officials have completed a preliminary damage assessment.

About two dozen people remain unaccounted for, down from a staggering high of 1,300 a few weeks ago.\n\nAbout 31,000 students in all have been away from school since the disaster. On Monday, nearly all of them went back, though some of them attended class in other buildings because their schools were damaged or destroyed, or inaccessible inside evacuation zones.\n\nBella was shy and not very talkative but agreed she was excited to be going back. She wanted to see her friends.\n\nThe small, tidy hotel room with two queen beds has been home to the family of five for some two weeks. Since they lost nearly everything to the fire, there was little to clutter up the space. The Hails are booked there until February.\n\n\"Bella, what time is it?\" Hail asked her daughter, waking her up in their hotel room.\n\n\"Seven dot dot three five,\" came the 8-year-old's sing-song reply. 7:35. It was time to brush her teeth, comb her hair and hit the road for a nearly hourlong drive to school in the family SUV.\n\nA few minutes later, at seven-dot-dot-four-seven, they were out the door.\n\nSome families driven out by the inferno have left the state or are staying with friends or relatives too far away for the children to go back to school in Butte County.\n\nThe Hails \u2014 whose five-bedroom, two-bath home in Paradise was destroyed \u2014 are staying in Yuba City, a long drive from their new school in Durham.\n\nIt was shortly before the 9 a.m. start of the school day when they pulled up to Durham Elementary School, where Bella is in third grade and Vance is in half-day kindergarten.\n\nAcross the county, nearly all of the teachers are returning to provide a familiar and comforting face to the children.\n\n\"It's important that the kids are able to stay together and have some sort of normalcy in the crazy devastation that we're having now,\" said Jodi Seaholm, whose daughter Mallory is a third-grader.\n\nMallory underwent radiation in October to treat a recurrence of brain cancer and showed no fear, Seaholm said, but \"this situation with her house burning down has absolutely devastated her.\"\n\nCounselors brought in from around the country were in nearly every classroom Monday to help children who were distressed by their escape through a burning town and the loss of their homes, Paradise school Superintendent Michelle John said at a celebratory news conference. Many of the teachers lost their homes as well.\n\n\"Our kids are traumatized,\" John said. \"Their families are traumatized.\"\n\nMost of Paradise High School survived but is inaccessible.\n\nThe district doesn't have space yet for intermediate and high school students whose classrooms were rendered unusable, so for the 13 days before the holiday break begins, they will learn through independent study. They will have access to online assignments and a drop-in center at a mall in Chico where they can get help from teachers or see classmates.\n\nSchoolwork will probably be secondary to dealing with trauma and reconnecting with friends, said Paradise High Principal Loren Lighthall.\n\n\"They don't have their church, they don't have their school, they don't have their work, they don't have their friends. They don't have any of that stuff, and we're asking them to write five-paragraph essays?\" Lighthall said. \"It's just unreasonable at this point.

Kamala Harris will release her memoir, \"The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,\" with a picture book memoir to debut around the same time.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, there's Michelle Obama. The former first lady has repeatedly said she has no plans to run for office, but she's filled arenas and influenced the political conversation as she's promoted her memoir, \"Becoming.\"\n\n\n\nAhead of a 2020 primary that could pit as many as two dozen Democrats against one another, the books offer potential presidential candidates an early opportunity to introduce themselves to voters in a favorable light.\n\n\n\n\"Every campaign book has to figure out a way in the predictable tsunami of campaign books that will be coming for the 2020 election to distinguish their book and their product and to extend their brand,\" said Steve Ross, who formerly led Random House's Crown division and worked with authors including former President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nIt's a strategy that has served presidential hopefuls from Abraham Lincoln to Donald Trump, who wrote or authorized books that served as platforms for ideas and shaping their image.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's \"Profiles in Courage\" came out in 1955, when he was in his late 30s, and its sketches of political figures who made unpopular decisions presented him as a serious thinker who, like his subjects, would risk his career for the right cause.\n\nSen. John McCain's career was influenced, in part, by his acclaimed memoir \"Faith of My Fathers,\" which came out in 1999, around the time of his first presidential run. It marked the first time he wrote at length about his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, which helped define his public identity.\n\n\n\nThe deeply personal exploration of race in Barack Obama's \"Dreams from My Father\" propelled him onto the national scene when it was republished during his 2004 Senate campaign. His follow-up, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" mixed policy ideas and personal reflections to become a vital part of his successful 2008 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nRoss, who is now the president of the Steve Ross Agency LLC, said the quality of the writing is key to a campaign book's success. If a book is well-written, he said, \"it's like selling out a theater with a two-hour biopic about your life that's directed by you and starring you, the politician.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of advantages for both the publisher and for the candidate to have a book as a narrative product,\" he added. \"They can't control what The Washington Post and The New York Times and Fox News is going to say about them, but they can control what's between the covers.\"\n\n\n\nWith book authorship comes the opportunity for would-be candidates to travel to promote not only their book but also their strategy for the country, said Michael Steel, who was an adviser to former House Speaker John Boehner and to Jeb Bush's 2016 Republican presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\"Particularly for the higher-profile potential candidates, it's an opportunity to get out there and talk about your vision and your record \u2014 and it's particularly good because in addition to political news outlets, you can talk to softer-edged media outlets,\" Steel said. \"You can go on 'The View,' you can go on the 'Today' show, you can go on radio stations across the country and talk about the book.\"\n\nGillibrand appeared on \"The View\" in November to promote her book, which contains stories of women who fought for the right to vote. In the interview, she said the book was for \"little boys and little girls to understand what leadership looks like.\"\n\n\n\nAs expected, she was asked about her own aspirations.\n\n\n\nCalling it a \"very important moral question,\" Gillibrand told the hosts that she believed she'd been called to fight \"as hard as I possibly can\" to restore decency and integrity to the country and that she was considering a run.\n\n\n\nSteel drew a distinction between the flurry of books that are being released as candidates consider launching campaigns and the books that are released before a presidential run is officially in the works.\n\n\n\n\"The books that are written before a candidate decides to run are often far more revealing about their actual character and personality and background,\" Steel said. \"Those are also the ones that can occasionally reveal things that the person probably wouldn't have revealed if they were planning to run for president.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "White House Seeks to End Subsidies for Electric Cars, Renewables", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-seeks-to-end-subsidies-for-electric-cars-renewables/4685685.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday the Trump administration wants to end subsidies for electric cars and other items, including renewable energy sources.\n\nAsked about plans after General Motors announced U.S. plant closings and layoffs last week, Kudlow pointed to the $2,500-to-$7,500 tax credit for consumers who buy plug-in electric vehicles, including those made by GM, under federal law.\n\n\"As a matter of our policy, we want to end all of those subsidies,\" Kudlow said. \"And by the way, other subsidies that were imposed during the Obama administration, we are ending, whether it's for renewables and so forth.\"\n\nAsked about a timeline, he said: \"It's just all going to end in the near future.

Cohen said he lied to support Trump\u2019s public claims that he was not involved in any Russia deal at the time.\n\nEarlier, Cohen, Trump\u2019s lawyer for 12 years, had pleaded guilty to violating laws that involved his taxi business, his financial dealings with at least three banks and his secretive efforts to influence the election just before the vote by paying $280,000 in hush money to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump in years past. Cohen faces several years in prison but has yet to be sentenced.\n\n\u201cYou mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term?\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cHe makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get his wife and father-in-law...off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.\u201d\n\nAfter Cohen pleaded guilty last week to lying to Congress, Trump called his former attorney \"a weak person.\" Later, Trump defended his continued work on business ventures during the campaign as \"very legal & very cool.\"\n\n\n\nIn another Monday tweet, Trump praised Roger Stone, one of his long-time political operatives, for saying last week, \u201cI will never testify against Trump.\u201d Trump said Stone was \u201cessentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories\u201d about Trump. \u201cNice to know that some people still have \u2018guts!\u2019\u201d\n\nOne Trump critic, George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, suggested that the U.S. leader was obstructing justice by urging Stone to continue his resistance to Mueller.

The meter-wide, shallow channel runs the length of a football field alongside one of the port\u2019s giant parking lots.\n\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s always pretty,\u201d May corrected himself. Even the gunk. Because that gunk is removing pollution from the Chesapeake Bay. Plus, May\u2019s colleagues are turning it into clean, renewable electricity.\n\nThe Chesapeake needs the help.\n\n\u200bAlgal feast\n\nLike many waterways around the world, the bay is polluted with excess nutrients from farm fertilizer runoff, city wastewater and other sources. Algae feast on those nutrients, triggering massive growth that chokes out other aquatic life. Last summer, algal growth left an average of 4.6 cubic kilometers of the bay without oxygen.\n\nA third of the pollution reaching the bay literally falls out of the sky.\n\nFossil fuels burned in power plants, cars and elsewhere create nitrogen oxide air pollution, which ultimately ends up in the bay, either attached to airborne particles or dissolved in rainwater.\n\nForests would soak up that pollution. But like many urban areas, the Port of Baltimore has a pavement problem. There\u2019s not a tree to be found at the entire 230-hectare Dundalk Marine Terminal, where the algae scrubber is located.\n\nSo regulators require the port to remove as much pollution from the bay as its parking lots allow in. That\u2019s where the algal turf scrubber comes in.\n\nPutting algae to work\n\nThe scrubber is like \u201ca controlled algal bloom on land,\u201d May said, \u201cwhich puts the algae to work pulling nutrients out of the water.\u201d\n\nThe city of Durham, N.C., is planning to build another scrubber to clean up a local reservoir. A pilot study found it would cost about half as much as typical pollution control measures, such as constructed wetlands, and much less than retrofitting existing systems. Others are up and running in Florida.\n\nThe algal turf scrubber creates one big challenge, May said.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with that algae? You have to have an end use or else you\u2019re going to pile that algae up very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. It\u2019s been turned into animal feed. It can be fermented into biofuels. Some of May\u2019s colleagues have used it to launch a fertilizer business.\n\nBut here at the Port of Baltimore, they\u2019re turning it into electricity.\n\nDigesting for power\n\nMay works with University of Maryland colleague Stephanie Lansing, an expert in a process called anaerobic digestion. It\u2019s not much different from our own digestion.\n\n\u201cYou have bacteria in your gut that break down food. We\u2019re doing that same process in an anaerobic digester,\u201d Lansing said. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking down the material, and we\u2019re producing energy in the process.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the microbes digesting the algae produce methane biogas.

It will get even closer in the days ahead and go into orbit around Bennu on Dec. 31. No spacecraft has ever orbited such a small cosmic body.\n\n\n\nIt is the first U.S. attempt to gather asteroid samples for return to Earth, something only Japan has accomplished so far.\n\n\n\nFlight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives once confirmation came through that Osiris-Rex made it to Bennu \u2014 exactly one week after NASA landed a spacecraft on Mars.\n\n\n\n\"Relieved, proud, and anxious to start exploring!\" tweeted lead scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona. \"To Bennu and back!\"\n\nWith Bennu some 76 million miles (122 million kilometers) away, it took seven minutes for word to get from the spacecraft to flight controllers at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado. The company built the spacecraft there.\n\n\n\nBennu is estimated to be just over 1,600 feet (500 meters) across. Researchers will provide a more precise description at a scientific meeting next Monday in Washington.\n\n\n\nAbout the size of an SUV, the spacecraft will shadow the asteroid for a year, before scooping up some gravel for return to Earth in 2023.\n\n\n\nScientists are eager to study material from a carbon-rich asteroid like dark Bennu, which could hold evidence dating back to the beginning of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago. As such, it's an astronomical time capsule.\n\n\n\nA Japanese spacecraft, meanwhile, has been hanging out at another near-Earth asteroid since June, also for samples. It is Japan's second asteroid mission. This latest rock is named Ryugu and about double the size of Bennu.\n\n\n\nRyugu's specks should be here by December 2020, but will be far less than Osiris-Rex's promised booty.\n\n\n\nOsiris-Rex aims to collect at least 60 grams, or 2 ounces, of dust and gravel. The spacecraft won't land, but rather use a 10-foot (3-meter) mechanical arm in 2020 to momentarily touch down and vacuum up particles. The sample container would break loose and head toward Earth in 2021.\n\n\n\nThe collection \u2014 parachuting down to Utah \u2014 would represent the biggest cosmic haul since the Apollo astronauts hand-delivered moon rocks to Earth in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n\n\nNASA has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles before, but never asteroid samples. Japan managed to return some tiny particles in 2010 from its first asteroid mission , also named Hayabusa.\n\n\n\nBoth Bennu and Ryugu are considered potentially hazardous asteroids. That means they could smack Earth years from now. At worst, Bennu would carve out a crater during a projected close call 150 years from now.\n\n\n\nContact with Bennu will not significantly change its orbit or make it more dangerous to us, Lauretta stressed.\n\n\n\nScientists contend the more they learn about asteroids, the better equipped Earth will be in heading off a truly catastrophic strike.\n\n\n\nThe $800 million Osiris-Rex mission began with a 2016 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its odometer read 1.2 billion miles (2 billion kilometers) as of Monday.\n\n\n\nBoth the spacecraft and asteroid's names come from Egyptian mythology.

The spacecraft made four orbits over six hours as it chased down the space station for the docking.\n\nThe astronauts were the first sent to be sent to the space station since a crewed Soyuz launch was aborted in October after a booster rocket failed to separate properly, crippling the rocket. The families of the crew, other astronauts and space officials from several nations breathed a sigh of relief after observing the flawless launch.\n\nNASA and Roscosmos said all onboard systems operated normally and the astronauts felt fine during the six-hour trip to the space station. After two hours of waiting in their capsule to confirm their ship was firmly docked to the station, they exited the capsule to join three astronauts already aboard the orbiting outpost at 1:37 a.m. (1940 GMT; 2:40 p.m. EST.)\n\nThe station\u2019s current crew of NASA\u2019s Serena Aunon-Chancellor, Russian Sergei Prokopyev and German Alexander Gerst were waiting to greet the newcomers.

And it\u2019s unclear when, if ever, this particular order by the company\u2019s founder and CEO will arrive.\n\nBezos made billions of dollars by transforming the retail sector. But overcoming the regulatory hurdles and safety issues posed by drones appears to be a challenge even for the world\u2019s wealthiest man. The result is a blown deadline on his claim to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in December 2013 that drones would be making deliveries within five years.\n\nThe day may not be far off when drones will carry medicine to people in rural or remote areas, but the marketing hype around instant delivery of consumer goods looks more and more like just that \u2014 hype. Drones have a short battery life, and privacy concerns can be a hindrance, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will see delivery of burritos or diapers in the suburbs,\u201d says drone analyst Colin Snow.\n\nDrone usage has grown rapidly in some industries, but mostly outside the retail sector and direct interaction with consumers.\n\nThe government estimates that about 110,000 commercial drones are operating in U.S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022. They are being used in rural areas for mining and agriculture, for inspecting power lines and pipelines, and for surveying.\n\nAmazon says it is still pushing ahead with plans to use drones for quick deliveries, though the company is staying away from fixed timelines.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to making our goal of delivering packages by drones in 30 minutes or less a reality,\u201d says Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish. The Seattle-based online retail giant says it has drone development centers in the United States, Austria, France, Israel and the United Kingdom.\n\nDelivery companies have been testing the use of drones to deliver emergency supplies and to cover ground quickly in less populated areas. By contrast, package deliveries would be concentrated in office parks and neighborhoods where there are bigger issues around safety and privacy.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration approved a three-year program for private companies and local government agencies to test drones for deliveries, inspections and other tasks.\n\nBut pilot programs by major delivery companies suggest few Americans will be greeted by package-bearing drones any time soon. United Parcel Service tested launching a drone from a delivery truck that was covering a rural route in Florida. DHL Express, the German delivery company, tested the use of drones to deliver medicine from Tanzania to an island in Lake Victoria.\n\nFrank Appel, the CEO of DHL\u2019s parent company, Deutsche Post AG, said \u201cover the next couple of years\u201d drones will remain a niche vehicle and not widely used. He said a big obstacle is battery life.\n\n\u201cIf you have to recharge them every other hour, then you need so many drones and you have to orchestrate that. So good luck with that,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nAppel said human couriers have another big advantage over drones: They know where customers live and which doorbell to ring. \u201cTo program that in IT is not that easy and not cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts say it will take years for the Federal Aviation Administration to write all the rules to allow widespread drone deliveries.\n\nSnow, the CEO of Skylogic Research, says a rule permitting operators to fly drones beyond their line of sight \u2014 so critical to deliveries \u2014 is at least 10 years away. A method will be needed to let law enforcement identify drones flying over people \u2014 federal officials are worried about their use by terrorists.\n\nWhile the rules are being written, companies will rely on waivers from the FAA to keep experimenting and running small-scale pilot programs.\n\n\u201cPeople like DHL and the rest of them (will say), \u2018Hey, we can deliver via drone this parcel package to this island,\u2019 but that\u2019s not the original vision that Amazon presented,\u201d Snow says.\n\nThere is a long list of FAA rules governing drone flights. They generally can\u2019t fly higher than 400 feet, over many federal facilities, or within five miles of an airport. Night flights are forbidden. For the delivery business, the most biggest holdup is that the machines must remain within sight of the operator at all times.\n\nIn June, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the FAA\u2019s was being overly conservative in its safety standards for drones. The group said FAA\u2019s risk-averse attitude was holding back beneficial uses, such as drones helping firefighters who are battling a fierce blaze.\n\nEven before the criticism by the scientific panel, the FAA had begun to respond more quickly to operators\u2019 requests for waivers from some rules, says Alan Perlman, founder of the Drone Pilot Ground School in Nashville, Tennessee. He said it is also getting easier and cheaper to buy liability insurance.\n\nBezos was mindful of the safety issues, telling \u201c60 Minutes\u201d back in 2013, \u201cThis thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head while they're walking around their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from predicting that drones fed with GPS coordinates would be taking off and making deliveries in \u201cfour, five years. I think so. It will work, and it will happen.\u201d\n\nTo Perlman, the billionaire\u2019s optimism made perfect sense.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in his world you think more about technology than regulations, and the (drone) technology is there,\u201d Perlman said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Make Doctors Better?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/can-artificial-intelligence-make-doctors-better/4682459.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Teacher Rishi Rawat has one student who is not human, but a machine.\n\nLessons take place at a lab inside the University of Southern California\u2019s (USC) Clinical Science Center in Los Angeles, where Rawat teaches artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nTo help the machine learn, Rawat feeds the computer samples of cancer cells.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a computer brain, and you can put the data into them and they will learn the patterns and the pattern recognition that\u2019s important to making decisions,\u201d he explained.\n\nAI may soon be a useful tool in health care and allow doctors to understand biology and diagnose disease in ways that were never humanly possible.\n\n\u200bDoctors not going away\n\n\u201cMachines are not going to take the place of doctors.

The type of treatment depends on the type of cancer and whether the tumor is driven by estrogen. Currently, pathologists would take a thin piece of tissue, put it on a slide, and stain with color to better see the cells.\n\n\u201cWhat the pathologist has to do is to count what percentage of the cells are brown and what percentage are not,\u201d said Dan Ruderman, a physicist who is also assistant professor of research medicine at USC.\n\nThe process could take days or even longer. Scientists say artificial intelligence can do something better than just count cells. Through machine learning, it can recognize complicated patterns on how the cells are arranged, with the hope, in the near future of making a quick and more reliable diagnosis that is free of human error.\n\n\u201cAre they disordered? Are they in a regular spacing? What\u2019s going on exactly with the arrangement of the cells in the tissue,\u201d described Ruderman of the types of patterns a machine can detect.\n\n\u201cWe could do this instantaneously for almost no cost in the developing world,\u201d Agus said.\n\n\u200bComputing power improves\n\nScientists say the time is ripe for the marriage between computer science and cancer research.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, we have the computing power to really do it in real time. We have the ability of scanning a slide to high enough resolution so that the computer can see every little feature of the cancer. So it\u2019s a convergence of technology. We couldn\u2019t have done this, we didn\u2019t have the computing power to do this several years ago,\u201d Agus said.\n\nData is key to having a machine effectively do its job in medicine.\n\n\u201cOnce you start to pool together tens and hundreds of thousands of patients and that data, you can actually [have] remarkable new insight, and so AI and machine learning is allowing that. It\u2019s enabling us to go to the next level in medicine and really take that art to new heights,\u201d Agus said.\n\nBack at the lab, Rawat is not only feeding the computer more cell samples, he also designs and writes code to ensure that the algorithm has the ability to learn features unique to cancer cells.\n\nThe research now is on breast cancer, but doctors predict artificial intelligence will eventually make a difference in all forms of cancer and beyond."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Help Doctors Make Better Decisions?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/can-artificial-intelligence-help-doctors-make-better-decisions/4682331.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, doctors may soon have new ways of diagnosing and treating patients in ways that were never humanly possible.

They include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, The Luxury Collection, Le Meridien and Four Points. Starwood-branded timeshare properties were also affected. None of the Marriott-branded chains were threatened.\n\nEmail notifications for those who may have been affected begin rolling out Friday and the full scope of the breach was not immediately clear.\n\nMarriott was trying to determine if the purloined records included duplicates, such as a single person staying multiple times.\n\nBreach undetected for a while\n\nSecurity analysts were especially alarmed to learn of the breach\u2019s undetected longevity. Marriott said it first detected it Sept. 8 but was unable to determine until last week what data had possibly been exposed because the thieves used encryption to remove it in order to avoid detection.\n\nMarriott said it did not yet know how many credit card numbers might have been stolen. A spokeswoman said Saturday that it was not yet able to respond to questions such as whether the intrusion and data theft was committed by a single or multiple groups.\n\nCybersecurity expert Andrei Barysevich of Recorded Future said Saturday he believed the breach was financially motivated.\n\nThe cybercrime gang expert in credit card theft such as the eastern European group known as Fin7 could be a suspect, he said, noting that a dark web credit card vendor recently announced that 2.6 million cards stolen from an unnamed hotel chain would soon be available to the online criminal underworld.\n\n\u201cWe will have to wait until an official forensic report, although, Marriott may never share their findings openly,\u201d he said.\n\nMarriott said the stolen credit card information was encrypted but the hackers may have obtained the \u201ctwo components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers.\u201d It said it cannot \u201crule out the possibility that both were taken.\u201d\n\nPrivacy laws\n\nFor as many as two-thirds of those affected, the exposed data could include mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers. Also dates of birth, gender, reservation dates, arrival and departure times and Starwood Preferred Guest account information.\n\nThe breach of personal information could put Marriott in violation of new European privacy laws, as guests included European travelers.\n\nMarriott set up a website and call center for customers who believe they are at risk.\n\nThe FBI said anyone contacted by Marriott should \u201ctake steps to monitor and safeguard their personally identifiable information and report any suspected instances of identity theft to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.\u201d\n\nPassport numbers have previously been part of a hack, though it\u2019s not common. They were among records on 9.4 million passengers of Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific obtained in a breach announced in October.\n\nCombined with names, addresses and other personal information, passport numbers are a greater concern than stolen credit card numbers because thieves could use them to open fraudulent accounts, said analyst Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com.\n\nHotels long a source of information\n\nThe data purloining highlights just how dangerous hotels can be for people worried about their privacy.\n\n\u201cHotels have long been important government sources of local information for tracking foreigners: reservation systems and loyalty programs took the surveillance global and made it easier for us to give up our privacy,\u201d said Colin Bastable, CEO of Lucy Security.\n\nIntelligence agencies including the U.S. National Security are well plugged into the global travel industry \u201cby fair means or foul,\u201d he said, nongovernment cybercriminals now have the same hacking tools.\n\n\u201cConsumers have become collateral damage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are all consumers.\u201d He advises providing hotels with as little information as possible when making reservations and checking in.\n\nLast year, the cybersecurity firm FireEye highlighted an effort in which Russian state agents allegedly tried to infiltrate the reservation systems of hotels in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n21 million Starwood program members\n\nWhen its acquisition by Marriott was first announced in 2015, Starwood had 21 million people in its loyalty program.

Microsoft surpassed Apple briefly a few times this week, but didn't close on top until Friday, with a market value of $851 billion to Apple's $847 billion. Microsoft hadn't been at the top since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.\n\nApple's plunge\n\n\n\nMicrosoft became a contender again in large part because Apple's stock fell nearly 20 percent in November, while Microsoft hasn't done any worse than the rest of the stock market. But the fact that it hasn't done poorly reflects its steady focus on business customers in recent years.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft lost its luster as people were shunning PCs in favor of smartphones. In 2013, PC sales plunged 10 percent to about 315 million, the worst year-to-year drop ever, according to research firms Gartner and IDC. It didn't help that Microsoft's effort to make PCs more like phones, Windows 8, was widely panned.\n\n\n\nBut a turnaround began when the Redmond, Wash., company promoted Nadella as CEO in 2014. He succeeded Microsoft's longtime CEO, Steve Ballmer, who initially scoffed at the notion that people would be willing to pay $500 or more for Apple's iPhones.\n\nThat bet paid off. Windows is now a dwindling fraction of Microsoft's business. While the company still runs consumer-focused businesses such as Bing search and Xbox gaming, it has prioritized business-oriented services such as its Office line of email and other workplace software, as well as newer additions such as LinkedIn and Skype. But its biggest growth has happened in the cloud, particularly the cloud platform it calls Azure. Cloud computing now accounts for more than a quarter of Microsoft's revenue, and Microsoft rivals Amazon as a leading provider of such services.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said Azure is still in its early days, meaning there's plenty of room for growth, especially considering the company's large customer base for Office and other products.\n\n\n\n\"While the tech carnage seen over the last month has been brutal, shares of [Microsoft] continue to hold up like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' he said.\n\n\n\nBeing less reliant on consumer demand helped shield Microsoft from holiday season turbulence and U.S.-China trade war jitters affecting Apple and other tech companies.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump amplified those tariff concerns when he told The Wall Street Journal in a story published late Monday that new tariffs could affect iPhones and laptops imported from China.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone maker had already seen its stock fall after reporting a mixed bag of quarterly results in early November amid fears about how the technology industry will fare in the face of such threats as rising interest rates, increased government regulation and Trump's escalating trade war with China.\n\nReporting change\n\n\n\nApple also spooked investors with an unexpected decision to stop disclosing how many iPhones it sells each quarter. That move has been widely interpreted as a sign that Apple foresees further declines in iPhone sales and is trying to mask that.\n\n\n\nWhile smartphones caused the downturn in personal computers years ago, sales of smartphones themselves have now stalled. That's partly because with fewer innovations from previous models, more people choose to hold on to the devices for longer periods before upgrading.\n\n\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust, said Microsoft is outperforming its tech rivals in part because of what it's not. It doesn't face as much regulatory scrutiny as advertising-hungry Google and Facebook, which have attracted controversy over their data-harvesting practices. Unlike Netflix, it's not on a hunt for a diminishing number of international subscribers. And while Amazon also has a strong cloud business, it's still more dependent on online retail."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Chris Cuomo's Eulogy For George H.W.

Democrats will take over from Republicans in the two offices.\n\nIn both states, the lawmakers are mimicking what happened in North Carolina in 2016, after Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, ousted Republican Pat McCrory. Before Cooper took office, the GOP-dominated Legislature moved to limit his power to make appointments, and it has since consistently tried to alter election rules to help Republicans. Cooper has managed to successfully fight some of the changes with lawsuits.\n\nMichigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina are all presidential battlegrounds, and in all three states district lines for House and state legislative seats have been heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. The GOP continues to control both chambers of the legislatures in each state, and Republican leaders want to limit the ability of Democrats to undercut the advances they have made in their conservative agendas.\n\nThe last election changed the state in a way that apparently the Legislature has decided to not accept. Wisconsin Gov.-elect Tony Evers (D)\n\nFor now, the situation in Wisconsin is most alarming to Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe last election changed the state in a way that apparently the Legislature has decided to not accept,\u201d Evers said Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nEvers, who defeated two-term Gov. Scott Walker, and his allies remain hopeful the GOP proposals won\u2019t pass and get signed into law, but some progressive groups have already begun discussing lawsuits.\n\nIn an interview with a conservative talk radio host, Wisconsin\u2019s state Senate majority leader was blunt when asked why the changes were necessary: to water down the power of the governor\u2019s office before Evers is in the job.\n\n\u201cWe trusted Scott Walker and the administration to be able to manage the back and forth with the Legislature,\u201d Sen. Scott Fitzgerald said, calling Democratic protests \u201cmanufactured outrage.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust Tony Evers right now in a lot of these areas.\u201d\n\nA key Wisconsin legislative committee held a hearing on the bills on Monday, and a vote could come as early as Tuesday. While the GOP has a large majority in Wisconsin\u2019s Assembly, they have a much smaller margin in the Senate, where just two Republican defections could doom the legislation. The state\u2019s chapter of Indivisible and other grassroots groups are organizing protests and putting pressure on GOP senators from swing districts.\n\nBarry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin and the director of its Elections Research Center, said Republicans were \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d after losing all five statewide races this fall.\n\n\u201cWhat the Republicans have left is the Supreme Court and the state Legislature,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe moving of the primary is a way to protect a conservative justice on the Supreme Court, and they\u2019ve said that very openly. There\u2019s nothing secret to them about that. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\nThe plan would move the date of the state\u2019s 2020 presidential primary from April to March, while keeping the election for the court seat in April. With a competitive Democratic presidential race and no real GOP challenge to President Donald Trump, liberal turnout is likely to be sky-high. By separating the presidential primary from the court contest,, Republicans hope a conservative judge will have a better shot at re-election.\n\nSixty of the 72 county clerks in Wisconsin oppose moving the primary date. On Monday, the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously to send written testimony to the Legislature saying that moving the primary date would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d and could cost the state between $6.4 and $6.8 million.\n\nBurden said that if the Republicans were successful in jamming through the last-minute changes, it could set an alarming precedent for lawmakers when future changes in statewide offices occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. One of the things that the Senate majority leader said today is that they were doing these things because they didn\u2019t trust the incoming governor. Well, doing these kinds of things actually sows mistrust,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts \u201cto try to ram through a bunch of things before (a new governor) can even have a say\u201dis going to \u201ctaint relations between the legislative branch and the executive branch immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nReuters Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer was one of a host of Democratic women elected statewide in Michigan.\n\nDemocrats are more hopeful they\u2019ll be able to stop the proposed changes in Michigan, where Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer won her race by a healthy margin and where outgoing GOP Gov. Rick Snyder has stayed neutral toward the Republican legislation.\n\nIt was the Republican effort in North Carolina to strip power from Cooper before he took office that provided a model for Wisconsin legislators to borrow from, said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a good government group.\n\n\u201cThe fact that North Carolina was able to do that to... Cooper and that the lame-duck Republican [governor] was there long enough to be able to sign some of the legislation to curtail some of the power of the new governor... I think this was something that the Republican legislative leaders looked at\u201d in Wisconsin, he said.\n\nThe Democratic Governors\u2019 Association, which spent heavily to help elect Evers and Whitmer, predicted the GOP attempts to curtail the new governors\u2019 would prove self-defeating."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Hey, Ivanka Trump: You\u2019ve Got The Wrong Definition Of \u2018Human Trafficking\u2019", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hey-ivanka-youve-got-the-wrong-definition-of-human-trafficking_us_5c059e6ce4b07aec57519779", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Mark Wilson via Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks at the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons as his daughter Ivanka Trump looks on.\n\nOn Friday, Ivanka Trump published an op-ed in The Washington Post highlighting her father\u2019s \u201cbold action\u201d to combat \u201cthe evil of human trafficking.\u201d Nearly 25 million people have been traded into human trafficking worldwide, she wrote, and her father has decided to make the issue a central feature of his domestic agenda.\n\nFew political issues have preoccupied the White House more than human trafficking. In 2017, Trump signed an executive order calling on federal agencies to crack down on transnational criminal networks. Trump brings up trafficking at rallies and press conferences and \u201clistening sessions.\u201d He is the first president to attend a meeting of the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. He declared January 2018 \u201cNational Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s statements, like his daughter\u2019s op-ed, cast human trafficking as a top-down criminal enterprise in which women and children are abducted from their home countries and brought to the U.S. against their will. \u201cHuman traffickers prey on their victims by promising a life of hope and greater opportunity, while delivering only enslavement,\u201d Trump said a month after his inauguration. \u201cThey steal women,\u201d he said last month, linking human trafficking to increased rates of immigration and asylum claims.\n\nIvanka Trump also describes human trafficking in exotic, extreme and amorphous terms, saying the phenomenon \u201csplinters families, distorts global markets, undermines the rule of law, strengthens transnational organized criminal networks and threatens national security.\u201d\n\nThese proclamations, however, describe a problem that bears little resemblance to the one found in academic and institutional reports. And, experts and advocates say, from what little we do know about human trafficking, the Trump administration is making it worse.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images Construction workers in Dubai. According to the International Labor Organization, three-quarters of workers engaged in forced labor are exploited in their home countries.\n\n\u201cTrafficking\u201d isn\u2019t what Ivanka thinks it is.\n\nIvanka Trump cites the International Labor Organization to claim that 24.9 million people are \u201cvictims of human trafficking, including forced labor and sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely accurate. While the first daughter\u2019s op-ed identifies forced labor as a subset of human trafficking, the ILO actually uses the terms interchangeably. Everyone working under conditions of forced labor, regardless of where they are or which activity they\u2019re engaged in, has technically been \u201ctrafficked.\u201d\n\nThis distinction matters. The ILO\u2019s figure of 24.9 million people refers to all victims of forced labor worldwide, few of whom are smuggled across borders and even fewer of whom are children. According to the ILO\u2019s 2016 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery \u2014 the source for Ivanka Trump\u2019s estimate \u2014 most trafficking victims are men and women exploited in their home countries in domestic work, agriculture and construction.\n\nOnly one-quarter of forced laborers live outside their home country and, of those, 96 percent move to countries with similar income levels. The canonical story of human trafficking is not a child sold to smugglers and taken abroad; it is a nanny forced to work long hours for low pay in the city where she was born.\n\nThe canonical story of human trafficking is not a child sold to smugglers and taken abroad; it is a nanny forced to work long hours for low pay in the city where she was born.\n\nA similar broadness shows up in the figures on sex work. The ILO estimates that 4.8 million people, including 1 million children, are victims of sexual exploitation worldwide. This definition, however, includes every form of prostitution and does not distinguish between, say, teenagers kidnapped to work in brothels and adults who engage in prostitution due to poverty or unemployment.\n\nPlus, the ILO notes that only 4 percent of victims of commercial sexual exploitation are in North or South America. The vast majority are exploited in their home countries for reasons having little to do with transnational criminal networks and everything to do with corruption, marginalization and vulnerability. A 2011 study of child sex workers in Thailand found that the overwhelming drivers of exploitation were social and economic conditions. For poor children whose parents couldn\u2019t find work, the study concluded, \u201cprostitution may be the best choice available.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean \u201chuman trafficking\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. But the phenomenon Ivanka Trump describes \u2014 people being forcibly taken across borders for work or sexual exploitation \u2014 appears to be much more isolated than her seven-digit estimate suggests.\n\nIn 2014, a nationwide database of law enforcement agencies found just 150 convictions for crimes related to bringing individuals into the United States against their will. A 2013 study found that the U.S. government had slashed its own estimates of the problem from 50,000 victims to 17,500 in just three years without explaining how the numbers were calculated in the first place. Even as Trump describes the problem as the worst it\u2019s ever been, his own press releases note that the Department of Homeland Security identified just 500 victims of trafficking nationwide in 2017.\n\nJOE KLAMAR via Getty Images Many immigrants in the United States work under conditions of debt bondage in agriculture. This form of labor trafficking, advocates say, will be exacerbated by the Trump administration's border policies.\n\nThe Trump Administration may be making it worse.\n\nWhile one problem in Ivanka Trump\u2019s op-ed concerns the definition of trafficking, another concerns her father\u2019s reaction to it.\n\nThe president\u2019s only major legislative effort on the issue is passing two laws, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, both of which aimed to shut down online advertisements for prostitution. While legislators justified the crackdown with calls to rescue sex workers (including using exaggerated statistics), actual sex workers have roundly criticized the laws for driving the industry underground and increasing their vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThis bill claims to target human trafficking,\u201d adult performer Lorelei Lee posted on Instagram, \u201cbut does so by creating new penalties for online platforms that are overwhelmingly used by consensual, adult sex workers to screen clients, to share \u2018bad date lists,\u2019 to work indoors, and to otherwise communicate with each other about ways to stay alive.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s other anti-trafficking efforts are similarly disconnected from the evidence on the nature and scale of human trafficking. Ivanka Trump\u2019s op-ed says countries with high trafficking rates will no longer receive foreign aid from the United States, but this declaration includes major exceptions and only affects a tiny portion of U.S. support. The president\u2019s anti-trafficking executive order simply restates existing policy and delivers vague mandates such as \u201cenhance cooperation with foreign counterparts.\u201d\n\nOther administration actions include showing an instructional video to visa applicants, despite the low likelihood that victims of trafficking or smuggling rings would apply for visas through official channels.\n\nIn nearly all of these efforts, the administration places its anti-trafficking efforts within its broader immigration policy. \u201cAs human smugglers and traffickers have learned how the game is played and how to game the system, we have witnessed a staggering 1,700 [percent] increase in asylum claims since the year 2010,\u201d Trump said in November, equating drug and human smugglers with people applying for refugee status.\n\nIn June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued in USA Today that open border policies would encourage human trafficking. Vice President Mike Pence has made the same argument, telling a room full of Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel that \u201cabolishing ICE also would mean more human trafficking.\u201d\n\nBut the links between immigration, sexual exploitation and forced labor aren\u2019t that simple.\n\nIn the United States, the factors leading to forced labor and sexual exploitation are the same as those abroad: structural inequality, systematic vulnerability and endemic poverty.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s policies are a gift to human traffickers,\u201d Saket Soni, the executive director of the National Guestworkers Alliance, told The Guardian last year.\n\nICE roundups, Soni pointed out, make undocumented immigrants less likely to report forced labor conditions. Trump\u2019s executive order cutting federal funds to sanctuary cities will make it harder for local law enforcement to investigate crimes against immigrants, including sexual exploitation. While the Department of Homeland Security and ICE claim to protect victims of trafficking from prosecution, these principles are only intermittently enforced and often result in people being deported back to countries where their risks of forced labor far exceed those in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that the term \u201chuman trafficking\u201d doesn\u2019t require movement across borders. In the United States, the factors leading to forced labor and sexual exploitation are the same as those abroad: structural inequality, systematic vulnerability and endemic poverty. Half of the children released from the foster care or juvenile justice systems end up homeless within six months.

Scott Walker to make one last major mark on the state\u2019s political landscape after he lost re-election in November.\n\nRepublicans forged ahead despite threats of lawsuits, claims by Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers and others that they were trying to invalidate results of the November election and howls of protest from hundreds of people who showed up for a public hearing.\n\nThe lame-duck maneuvering in Wisconsin is similar to what Republicans did in North Carolina two years ago and is being discussed in Michigan before a Democratic governor takes over there.\n\nAngry opponents filled the hallways of the Wisconsin Capitol, and the hearing room, banging on the doors and chanting \u201cRespect our votes!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d\n\nThe protests, coming at the end of Walker\u2019s eight years in office, were reminiscent of tumult that came shortly after he took office in 2011 and moved to end collective bargaining powers for public sector unions.\n\nIn addition to moving the primary date, the proposals would weaken the governor\u2019s ability to put in place rules that enact state laws and shield the state jobs agency from his control.\n\nOther measures would weaken the attorney general\u2019s office by allowing Republican legislative leaders to intervene in cases and hire their own attorneys. A legislative committee, rather than the attorney general, would have to sign off on withdrawing from federal lawsuits. That would stop Evers and incoming Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul from fulfilling their campaign promises to withdraw Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit seeking repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald downplayed concerns about what was being considered in the lame-duck session, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s outrageous at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut listen, I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that governor-elect Evers is going to bring a liberal agenda to Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nWalker has been largely silent on what is being considered, voicing general support last month for moving the primary date. But Fitzgerald said Walker and his chief of staff had been deeply involved in crafting the measures.\n\nFitzgerald wouldn\u2019t say whether there was enough support among Republicans for moving the 2020 presidential primary date, a change that would cost about $7 million and has drawn opposition from nearly every county election official.\n\nFitzgerald said last week that Republicans want to move the 2020 presidential primary, when Democratic turnout is expected to be high, so it won\u2019t be on the same date as an April election where Walker-appointed Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly is on the ballot, thereby improving his chances of victory.\n\nThe state Elections Commission unanimously adopted a motion Monday declaring that the shift would be \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d and costly without additional funding. Commissioner Mark Thomsen, a Democratic appointee, called the plan \u201cthe biggest waste of money for a single person that I can think of\u201d during discussion preceding the vote.\n\nFitzgerald and other Republican leaders said that changes to that proposal, and others including limiting early voting to two weeks before an election, were being considered and could be offered during floor debate Tuesday.\n\nSimilar limitations on early voting were found unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2016 and Democrats have threatened legal action again.\n\nA news conference where Fitzgerald and other Republican leaders spoke was peppered with catcalls from protesters.\n\nA Republican-controlled legislative committee planned to hold a public hearing for eight hours Monday, before taking votes late in the night to set up final approval in the Senate and Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nThe votes to pass the sweeping package of bills would come about a month before Evers is slated to take office.\n\nEvers decried the lame-duck session \u2014 the first in Wisconsin in eight years \u2014 as an embarrassment and an attempt to invalidate the results of the November election where Democrats won every constitutional office, including governor and attorney general.\n\nHe vowed to fight it, saying lawsuits were being explored, and called on the people of Wisconsin to contact their legislators even as the bills were speeding through. They were just made public late Friday .\n\n\u201cIt goes to the heart of what democracy is all about,\u201d Evers said at a Sunday news conference held at a Milwaukee law firm. \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong message, I think it is an embarrassment for the state and I think we can stop it.\u201d\n\nThe executive director of One Wisconsin Now, which filed the lawsuit challenging the previous attempt to limit early voting, said the Republican\u2019s latest effort shows they \u201crefuse to accept the results of the 2018 elections\u201d and are worried about large voter turnout.\n\nAbout 565,000 people voted early in the November elections.\n\nThe last lame-duck session in Wisconsin was eight years ago, just before Walker took office, when Democrats tried unsuccessfully to approve union contracts.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers who sit on the committee holding the hearing Monday said the scope of the lame-duck session was unprecedented and a reaction to Democrats winning all statewide races in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a power grab,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Jon Erpenbach. \u201cThey lost and they\u2019re throwing a fit.\u201d\n\nErpenbach said expected legal challenges to what is passed could \u201cgrind things to a halt\u201d in the Legislature for as much as a year.\n\nRepublicans have had majorities in the state Senate and Assembly since 2011, and worked with Walker the past eight years to past a host of conservative priorities. Republicans will maintain their majorities in the Legislature next year when the Democratic Evers takes over.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Florida SWAT Officer Demoted After Wearing QAnon Patch In Photo With Mike Pence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-cop-qanon-mike-pence_us_5c05c223e4b0cd916faf01b7", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "A SWAT officer in Broward County, Florida, has been demoted after he was photographed wearing a QAnon conspiracy theory patch when he greeted Vice President Mike Pence on Friday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nOn his uniform, Matt Patten wore a patch reading \u201cQuestion the Narrative,\u201d which was not authorized by the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the Miami New Times.\n\nTwitter/VP Matt Patten, wearing a QAnon patch as Vice President Mike Pence walks by.\n\nOn Monday, the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a written reprimand to Patten, stating that the QAnon conspiracy theory was \u201ccontroversial\u201d and made the sheriff\u2019s office seem \u201cbiased\u201d politically.\n\n\u201cThis resulted in negative ramifications on a national platform as a controversy for the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the County, the SWAT team, and Sergeant Patten,\u201d the reprimand read.\n\nPatten was removed from the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s strategic investigations division\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and from the agency SWAT team, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright.\n\nHe will now be reassigned to the Department of Law Enforcement, she told local station WPLG TV.\n\nFor those not in the know, the bizarre and dubious QAnon conspiracy theory suggests Donald Trump is actually working with special counsel Robert Mueller to uncover a deep-state cabal of elite liberal and Hollywood pedophiles."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Evil Genius Turns Giuliani's Typo-Ridden Tweet Into Hilarious Anti-Trump Message", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-tweet-anti-trump_us_5c059004e4b066b5cfa4b8db", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "We all needed this today.

The move comes 10 years after voters approved marijuana to alleviate the effects of certain illnesses. Many supporters believe that decadelong experience, as well as similar legalization efforts in other states, led to victory at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to smell like freedom,\u201d starting Thursday, said Detroit lawyer Matt Abel, who specializes in marijuana law and whose office sign says, \u201ccannabis counsel.\u201d\n\nEleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Of course, there are many caveats in Michigan and already some tension.\n\nHOW MUCH?\n\nMichigan residents who are 21 or older can possess or transport up to 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) of marijuana. They can grow up to 12 plants, although not in public view. They also can give 2.5 ounces (70.8 grams) to another person, but not for payment.\n\nBUZZ ZONES\n\nMarijuana can be consumed only at homes or other private property, although landlords and employers can prohibit it. It can\u2019t be smoked at bars or restaurants or any other place that is accessible to the public. That means getting high while walking the dog or hustling between college classes could lead to trouble.\n\nMichigan colleges and universities have repeatedly stated that campus anti-drug policies won\u2019t change. Employers will still be able to fire people for drug use.\n\nPOT SHOPS\n\nThe doors are not open yet. The new law creates a system of growing and selling marijuana, with millions of dollars to be collected in taxes, but those shops still are months away and must involve state regulators. So people who want marijuana now will need to grow it or obtain it by other, perhaps illegal, means.\n\nMichigan is just beginning to license medical-marijuana dispensaries. Abel hopes Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer considers allowing them to sell marijuana for recreational use to meet demand.\n\n\u201cThe sooner they license retail stores, the sooner the state will be collecting revenue,\u201d he says.\n\nLOCAL RESISTANCE\n\nDepending on where people live, buying marijuana won\u2019t be as easy as buying bread. Elected officials in some communities already have voted to ban pot businesses, long before rules are in place. A local veto is available under the law. Local governments also can revisit their policy later.\n\nCommunities that block marijuana businesses lose an opportunity to capture a portion of a 10 percent tax. But St. Joseph Mayor Mike Garey predicts: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\u201d St. Joseph is out for now.\n\nPOLICE AND PROSECUTORS\n\nAfter the election, some prosecutors said they would dismiss any pending misdemeanor cases involving small amounts of marijuana that now will be legal.\n\n\u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker says.\n\nExpungement of past convictions is also being considered in some counties. Marijuana still is illegal under federal law, although Michigan\u2019s federal prosecutors say they typically pursue major drug traffickers, not \u201clow-level offenders.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Khloe Kardashian And Cardi B Aren't Selling Tea, They're Selling Body Dysmorphia In A Bag.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-jameela-jamil-celebrity-teas_us_5c0150f4e4b0d04f48b394e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Actress Jameela Jamil has had it with celebrities who hawk diet products on social media. For months, she\u2019s been calling them out. In May, she said Kim Kardashian West is a \u201cterrible and toxic influence on young girls\u201d for promoting appetite suppressant lollipops. This week, she scolded Cardi B for crediting a laxative tea for her post-baby snapback.\n\nThey got Cardi B on the laxative nonsense \u201cdetox\u201d tea. GOD I hope all these celebrities all shit their pants in public, the way the poor women who buy this nonsense upon their recommendation do. Not that they actually take this shit. They just flog it because they need MORE MONEY pic.twitter.com/OhmTjjWVOp \u2014 Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamil) November 24, 2018\n\n\u201cGOD I hope all these celebrities all shit their pants in public, the way the poor women who buy this nonsense upon their recommendation do,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cNot that they actually take this shit. They just flog it because they need MORE MONEY.\u201d\n\nShe followed up her criticism of Cardi with a collage of famous \u201cdetox\u201d tea peddlers with huge followings, including Kim and Cardi as well as Khloe Kardashian and Amber Rose. These women pose with laxative teas marketed as weight loss products while showing off their perfectly flat stomachs for viewers.\n\nThe problem Jamil is attacking doesn\u2019t begin with the women or these ads. It arises from a sexist culture that tells women our bodies aren\u2019t good enough and our worth lies in our beauty. Most of us can sympathize with the pressures famous women face to maintain a perfect image.\n\nBut Jamil is right to be upset with anyone who uses her huge following to sell unrealistic beauty standards and ineffective weight loss aids. And we should all be outraged.\n\nMost of these stars have access to personal trainers, nutritionists, cooks and plastic surgeons who make their perfect bodies possible. The vast majority of women seeing these ads will never be able to achieve the same results \u2015 even if they are drinking the teas and eating the lollipops \u2015 because they don\u2019t have the same resources as their favorite celebrity.\n\nIf there\u2019s not an ongoing conversation about this reality, the women are selling false dreams, and those dreams have real-life consequences.\n\nPromoting these weight loss products promotes a culture where disordered eating and body dysmorphia are the norm. It\u2019s all in the names. Flat Tummy Tea and Skinny Tea are everywhere. Their names tell customers that this is the path to getting the body they desire. In reality, these products temporarily get rid of water weight, not fat, and they create bad habits.\n\nThese women are selling false dreams and those dreams have real-life consequences.\n\nLaxatives have long been popular among people who suffer from bulimia and anorexia. Encouraging users to manage their weight with what is essentially a laxative is the type of thing you\u2019d see in pro-anorexia communities online.\n\nMany of these products do more harm than good. They can do enormous damage to someone\u2019s mental and physical health. Tea peddlers endorse products without any mention of their dangers.\n\nThese teas usually contain senna, an herb with a laxative effect. Long-term consumption of stimulants like senna can create dependence. Dependent consumers have to continue using it or increasing their dosage to have regular bowel movements. What\u2019s worse is the National Eating Disorders Association warns that laxative abuse can lead to dehydration as well as electrolyte and mineral imbalances that cause kidney and heart failure.\n\nAt first glance, Jamil seems like the wrong vehicle for this message. She\u2019s tall, thin and beautiful. Perhaps, she should leave the beauty standard critiques for those of us who suffer the most. But when Jamil chastises celebrities for the impact they\u2019re having on teens, she\u2019s speaking from her own experience.\n\nShe\u2019s been open about her teenage battle with anorexia. On the collage Instagram post, she wrote. \u201cI listened to irresponsible celebrities and bought all these bad products and followed their TERRIBLE and toxic diet tips for how they maintained the tiny weight they were... and I fucked up my metabolism and digestive system for life.\u201d\n\nHer emphasis on the influence these women might have on young girls is justified. When the UK\u2019s Royal Society of Public Health surveyed 1,500 teens, the respondents named Instagram as the most harmful social media app. They said it made them feel worse about their body image and contributed to anxiety and depression.\n\nWhen Jameela Jamil chastises celebrities for the impact they\u2019re having on teens, she\u2019s speaking from her own experience.\n\nAnd kids aren\u2019t the only ones affected. Another study from the University of South Wales found that using social media for more than an hour a day is linked to decreased body image in adult women.\n\nIn the age of social media, women are altering their bodies more than ever before. Plastic surgery has increased in the United States by almost 200 percent since 2000. The normalization of these procedures is even more reason to be careful about the messages we send. When women are dying from botched surgeries to achieve the perfect figure, being conscientious of the products you\u2019re selling should be a moral obligation.\n\nIt\u2019s possible these celebrities don\u2019t know about the dangers of the products they\u2019re selling. Hopefully, they\u2019ll take time to learn more and correct their course. In the meantime, the issue must be addressed. While we can\u2019t expect digital celebrities to be perfect role models, when your livelihood depends on a community (comprised of mostly girls and women) trusting your influence, exploiting that relationship by profiting from their insecurities is unethical.\n\nEvery woman is a victim of our sexist culture, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a responsibility to act decently. Kim Kardashian West, Cardi B and Khloe Kardashian aren\u2019t hurting for money or ways to make it. Their diet product endorsements are brazen cash grabs, and they should be ashamed to sell women out for a quick buck."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil b eneath its coastal plain.\n\nSince Congress approved a measure last December to open the coastal plain to oil exploration, the Department of the Interior has been charging ahead with a plan to sell drilling leases as early as next year. Trucks weighing 90,000 pounds could begin rolling across the tundra even before then to conduct seismic tests that help pinpoint oil reserves.\n\nThe hurried approach has alarmed some government specialists and environmentalists, who say that risks to wildlife and damage to the tundra are not being taken seriously enough. And it comes as the Trump administration moves more broadly to exploit fossil fuels in Alaska and beyond, erasing restrictive policies that were designed to protect the environment and address global warming.\n\nThe New York Times examined how, in the space of about a year, the refuge\u2019s coastal plain \u2014 known as the 1002 Area \u2014 went from off-limits to open for business.

An infusion of $80 million into placenta research prompted Dr. Abuhamad and others to adapt technologies used in other fields, and has already provided valuable insights into early pregnancy.\n\nSome scientists are betting on magnetic resonance imaging scans, or M.R.I.s, as the most sensitive detectors of placental problems. They are using a method that measures oxygen levels in the blood; it is quick and, so far, seems to catch problems as early as the second trimester. Several teams worldwide are evaluating the technique, each in hundreds of women.\n\nBut M.R.I. is not widely in use in obstetricians\u2019 offices, Dr. Abuhamad said, in contrast with ultrasound machines, which would be a more practical option. Traditional ultrasounds can show the structure and location of the placenta, not how well the organ is functioning. But advances over the past five years have sharpened the machine\u2019s focus. One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems.
