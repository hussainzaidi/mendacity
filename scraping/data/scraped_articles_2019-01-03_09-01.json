And that will change everything.\n\nTrump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date -- insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. \"It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation,\" he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election.\n\nBut the early returns are not promising.

Presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has zero desire to acquiesce to the President during her first hours with a gavel in hand. Her diverse caucus may yet disagree on much, but they appear in lockstep over opposing Trump on the wall.\n\nSenate Republicans, who already voted once in the last Congress to keep government open, are on the sidelines having made clear they won't act on anything until a deal is reached that Trump will actually sign. And holiday season distractions meant that the misery of federal workers deprived of paychecks did not reach a critical mass that would force lawmakers to demand a swift resolution.\n\nSo, barring a miracle, the partial shutdown is not ending any time soon.\n\nSenate Republican Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday it could take \"weeks\" for government to reopen. Trump told reporters a resolution could take \"a long time.\"\n\nThe President hardened his position in an extraordinary 95-minute exchange that rambled through topics as diverse as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and machine gun-wielding Secret Service officers.\n\nStill mourning his canceled vacation in balmy Palm Beach, the President said he had hoped that Democrats would come back to town during his home alone Christmas to negotiate\n\nAnd he dug in on the $5 billion figure -- even after Vice President Mike Pence offered Democrats a $2.5 billion funding combination for border security and immigration funding late last year.\n\n\"No, not $2.5 billion, no. We're asking for $5.6 billion. And you know, if somebody said $2.5 billion, no,\" Trump said.\n\nThe political logic that prompted Trump to allow the government to close -- heavy pressure from conservative pundits and House lawmakers -- has not yet changed.\n\nHe's in no position to blink.\n\nIf he caves now, he will get the backlash he feared before, with extra intensity.\n\nDuring a Situation Room meeting involving congressional leaders, Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, asked Trump three times why he could not accept a short-term extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security while further negotiations take place.\n\n\"I would look foolish if I did that,\" Trump told Schumer, a person familiar with the conversation told CNN's Phil Mattingly.\n\nJudging by a barrage of holiday season tweets, Trump thinks he can wound the new Democratic majority in the House -- both by overshadowing its big opening day and branding his rivals weak on immigration.\n\nApparently seeking to build pressure on Democrats, two senior administration officials told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told the leaders: \"This is not a status quo situation. We are in a crisis situation.\"\n\nDemocrats ready to wield power\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage 02:19\n\nYet Democrats don't seem spooked by Trump's gambit.\n\nIn fact, the President's hardline rhetoric on immigration was blamed by many analysts on both sides of the political divide for the disastrous performance among suburban voters that cost the GOP its House majority.\n\nStill, the wall was fundamental to Trump's appeal to his base, and helped win him the Republican nomination, so it's hardly surprising his calculations on the issue differ from those of outsiders.\n\nTrump, who ran against the Washington establishment and believes there is a deep state conspiracy to thwart him, may also be impervious to the plight of federal workers\n\n\"The President is not long on empathy,\" said Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania who often supports Trump and is now a CNN political analyst.\n\n\"I think he feels like he can weather this storm because he's not really concerned about the people calling him and saying 'I can't pay my bills' ... I think he feels like this is the issue he wants to set the template for how this Congress is going to work with the Democrats in charge,\" Santorum said.\n\nOnce Pelosi is sworn in for her second spell as House speaker, a step expected later Thursday, she plans to show that Democrats can offer stable, responsible government in contrast to the chaos of the Trump era.\n\nThat's why one of the first acts of the new Democratic House will be to pass a bill that would reopen the government in the short term and does not fund the wall -- essentially replicating a bill passed in the GOP-led Senate last year.\n\n\"We're asking the President to open up government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it? Why would he not do it?\" Pelosi said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe strategy lets Democrats make the case that they had power for a matter of hours and tried to reopen government.\n\nDepriving Trump of funding for his wall -- the ultimate symbol of the Democratic Party's 2016 election humiliation -- also fosters unity in a coalition already showing ethnic, gender and generational fault lines.\n\nAs an added benefit, Democrats can also drive a wedge between the rival GOP centers of power in Washington and expose the tenuous relationship between Senate Republicans and their President.\n\nWednesday's events also suggest that Trump, who has spent his entire presidency cocooned by a GOP power monopoly in Washington, is yet to appreciate the new reality of divided government. He will no longer be able to activate a cell of conservatives Republicans to incite chaos in the House.\n\nHow the shutdown could end\n\nMcConnell is signaling that the House vote on reopening the government will not change much.\n\n\"One partisan vote in the House tomorrow is not going to solve anything. I made it clear to the Speaker we're not interested in show votes in the Senate,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that Senate Republicans are maneuvering to offer Trump a face saving way out of what appears to be a dead end. In the past McConnell has been key to ending standoffs between various administrations and Capitol Hill.\n\nEventually, however, the shutdown may get resolved in the typical Washington way, with a fudge that offers both sides a way to claim victory.\n\nIt will come as no consolation to government workers who have been furloughed or who are working without pay that their plight has not yet dominated news coverage, as during is often the case in shutdowns.\n\nSoon the real victims of the shutdown will begin inundating the offices of their Washington representatives with calls -- adding to political pressure for an end to the shutdown.\n\nIt's not as if there are no ideas for how to fix the situation that do not involve an abject climbdown by either side.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee published an op-ed in The Washington Post offering three approaches , including some already agreed in the past by bipartisan majorities.\n\nYet Trump's stream of consciousness in his press availability at the White House Wednesday was a reminder that he is a wild card, as impenetrable to his own side as to Democrats. He made up facts and offered no tell about what kind of fall back position he would accept.\n\nThat means that even if legislative linguists on Capitol Hill craft a way out for everyone, there is no guarantee that an unpredictable President, answering only to his gut, will buy it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Source: Trump fears Dems will make him 'look foolish'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/iiKxT8mWn_g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told a group of lawmakers he can't accept Democrats' offer to re-open the government as the two sides negotiate border wall funding because he \"would look foolish if I did that,\" according to a person familiar with the exchange.\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership from both sides of the aisle Wednesday amid an on-going partial government shutdown.\n\nThe President and Democrats are at odds over funding for a border wall.

It's so insignificant compared to what we're talking about. You know, I've heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigration,\" Trump said. \"The $5 billion approved by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.\"\n\nCNN previously reported that Vice President Mike Pence proposed $2.5 billion for a combination border security and immigration funding last week, but was rebuffed by Schumer.\n\nAsked about that proposal Wednesday, Trump said: \"No, not $2.5 (billion), no. We're asking for $5.6 (billion) and somebody said $2.5 (billion). No, look, this is national security we're talking about ... What I'm talking about is the $5.6 billion that the House approved.\"\n\nThe Democratic-led House plans to vote on a bipartisan package of six Senate spending bills and a stopgap measure to re-open the Department of Homeland Security at its current funding levels until February 8, the aide said. The temporary measure would maintain the current $1.3 billion in border security money, which can be used for fencing and repairs of current barriers.\n\nShutdown effects take root\n\nMeanwhile, the effects of the partial government shutdown are becoming more apparent.\n\nA total of 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or working without pay since December 21, and won't receive their next paychecks until the government reopens.\n\nMany workers may be starting to feel the pinch only now that the shutdown is stretching into a new pay period.

China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\n\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrives for a press conference at the Presidential Palace after the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on January 1, 2019.\n\nCross-strait tensions\n\nXi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address , in which she called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n\nWhile she acknowledged the elections were a \"serious test for the current government,\" Tsai said the results \"absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\"\n\nShe also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's \"attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Xi said China had \"achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\"\n\nLev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\n\n\"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections,\" he said. \"This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\"\n\nNachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing \"now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\"\n\n\"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force,\" he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\n\nA group of Hong Kong independence supporters display flags during the annual New Year's Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on January 1, 2019.\n\nHong Kong model\n\nThroughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to \"One Country, Two Systems\" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\n\nThat is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\n\n\"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security,\" Xi said.\n\nHow attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election . Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\n\n\"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely,\" Nachman said.\n\n\"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\"\n\nSpeaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.\n\n'No promise to renounce force'\n\nWhile Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for \"peaceful reunification\" above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.\n\n\"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" he said.\n\n\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,\" he said, adding that the \"issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\"\n\nWhile it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "6 killed in train accident on Danish bridge", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/MIe-k6LYwoc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) Six people were killed and 16 injured when a crowded commuter train and a truck trailer that apparently fell from a freight train collided on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, authorities said.\n\nThe rail accident, which is one of the deadliest in Danish history, took place at about 7:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. ET) Wednesday in high winds on a bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen.\n\nBo Haaning, of the Danish Accident Investigation Board, confirmed to CNN that the trailer had fallen off the freight train and hit the passenger train, but said it was not yet known whether this caused the accident or happened during it.\n\nThe freight train was carrying Carlsberg beer, a spokesman for the brewing company, which has its headquarters in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, told CNN.

And what he wrote was deeply critical of the way in which Trump has approached the presidency. Of Trump, Romney wrote: \"His conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThe Romney op-ed , which ran in The Washington Post, got A LOT of attention -- as he (and we) knew it would. And Trump responded -- \"Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\" -- as he (and we) knew he would.\n\nIt was all a Very Big Deal.\n\nBut here's the thing: I am very skeptical that any of this matters at all -- in terms of how Trump conducts himself and/or how the elected Republican leaders in Washington interact and react to him.\n\nThe first observation is patently obvious to anyone who has watched Trump's presidency -- or his life. He is who he is. The chances a 70+-year-old man who is currently the President of the United States changes his approach to life because a politician who has long been a critic writes an op-ed are, roughly, 0%.\n\nIf you need proof of that -- and if the first two years of Trump's presidency aren't proof enough -- simply look to his tweeted response to Romney's op-ed -- in which he urges the soon-to-be Utah senator to \"be a TEAM player & WIN!\"\n\nThe second thought -- that Romney's op-ed will change nothing about how Republican senators and House members interact with Trump -- is also based on recent observations.\n\nTake Romney. Yes, he was the most high-profile critic of Trump -- at least among those Republicans not running against him -- during the 2016 primary race. Romney gave a speech during the spring of 2016 in which he blasted Trump, saying, among other things, that \"dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark.\"\n\nAnd yet, after Trump won, Romney met with him when the President was apparently weighing naming the former Massachusetts governor as secretary of state. While Romney was occasionally critical of Trump during the 2018 Senate campaign, he said and did nothing even close to as overt as this Post op-ed when it could have hurt him electorally.\n\nRomney's record of opposition to Trump is not entirely consistent, to put it nicely. Who's to say that he will keep it up for the next two years (or longer)?\n\nEven if Romney does keep it up, there's reason for skepticism that his critique of Trump's approach to the presidency will have any actual impact on his colleagues. Over the past two years, Trump had several prominent Republican critics in the Senate -- Jeff Flake, John McCain and Bob Corker being the three best known. This is not a thank-God-someone-finally-said-it! sort of moment.\n\nFlake was driven into retirement by his anti-Trump views. Corker's political strength was affected as well, and he decided not to run again. McCain, afflicted with terminal brain cancer, passed away last year.\n\nAnd for all of their speaking out and appealing to the better angels within their colleagues' hearts and minds, Flake, McCain and Corker had zero measurable impact on rallying the Senate (or the House) against Trump.\n\nIf anything, they served as examples of what not to do -- challenge Trump and watch your base run away from you, never to come back.\n\nThe Republican Party -- as reflected by its elected officials in the House and Senate -- became more pro-Trump between the end of 2016 and the end of 2018. It did so for a variety of reasons, the main ones being: 1) to accomplish long-standing goals like a major tax cut or the confirmation of a slew of judges from the Supreme Court on down 2) to survive politically.\n\nThe belief that op-eds like Romney's might change things within the Republican establishment are, therefore, based on a false premise: That there is any sort of measurable Republican Party outside of those who align with Trump.\n\nThere is not. The 2018 election showed that. The path to victory for Republican candidates -- particularly in GOP primaries -- was to get as close to Trump as possible and never let go. Distancing yourself from the President was a recipe for Republican disaster.\n\nRomney's op-ed is then rightly understood not as a political earthquake but as a lone scream into the void. Sure, Trump has flatly rejected the idea of the presidency as a position of moral leadership. And yes, his policies are a clear break from what the GOP stood for even a few years ago.\n\nBut the idea that an op-ed will change how Romney's soon-to-be Republican colleagues will act toward Trump between now and the 2020 election is a total and complete fallacy. That ship sailed a long time ago. And no words written in a Washington Post op-ed are going to bring it back into harbor."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Romney on op-ed: I wanted to make it 'very clear where I stand'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/KGE3a9Ib7Nw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Sen.-elect Mitt Romney said Wednesday that while he would not run against President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race, he was not yet sure who he would endorse.\n\n\"I'm going to see what the alternatives are,\" Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"But I pointed out, there are places where we agree on a whole series of policy fronts.

It's a strip that allows people who use street drugs such as cocaine and heroin to test whether their drugs are laced with fentanyl.\n\nIf the drugs test positive, they might choose not to use them or choose to use less of them.\n\nAccording to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , fentanyl is now the deadliest drug in America and was linked to nearly 29% of all overdose deaths in 2016. The synthetic opioid is about 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and produces a powerful high. It's cheap and sometimes mixed into street drugs without the buyer even knowing. Given its potency, it can be deadly.\n\nFentanyl test strip technology was originally developed by a Canadian biotech company BTNX to test urine samples for the presence of the drug, but the strips work basically the same way when they're dipped in the residue of cooked heroin or when a little water is added to empty baggies of cocaine.\n\nIt works like a pregnancy test in reverse. One line on the strip suggests that the drugs are positive for fentanyl. Two lines is interpreted as a negative result.\n\nIn a study , researchers at Johns Hopkins and Brown University determined that the test strips worked to detect even low concentrations of fentanyl in street drugs.\n\n\"Our findings bring to the table evidence that can inform a public health approach to the fentanyl crisis. Smart strategies that reduce harm can save lives,\" Susan Sherman, a co-author on the study, said in a news release\n\nAccording to the study, several programs in the United States that distribute clean syringes to people who use drugs have started to distribute fentanyl test strips, as well.\n\nIn Los Angeles County , emergency departments, first responders and other heath care workers have been advised to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the strips with patients who use street drugs.\n\nThe test strips aren't 100% effective at eliminating the risk of overdose, since they don't identify all forms of fentanyl and can produce false negatives. They also don't let users know how much fentanyl the drugs contain.\n\nStill, the researchers see an opportunity to halt the increase in fentanyl-related overdose deaths.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in the overdose epidemic, and we need to embrace the full range of interventions that can save lives,\" Sherman said.\n\nIn a video , the Urban Survivor's Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of drug users, offers instructions on how to use the strips and what to do if the results are positive.\n\n\"Let's say you had some drugs you were going to inject. ... If it tests positive, you have options,\" the video explains. \"One, you can shoot half back into another sterile syringe, which may not only be life-saving but also cost-effective. Or two, you may even choose not to do it.\"\n\nThe concept of drug checking has jarred some.\n\nThe Trump administration's assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for mental Health and substance use, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, has expressed ardent opposition to the use of the fentanyl test strips.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a blog post , Katz laid out several reasons. Among them is a concern that even if people who use drugs know that their drugs are laced with fentanyl, they will still use the drugs, despite the apparent danger. They might also use the strips to seek out drugs that contain fentanyl to achieve a stronger high.\n\n\"We can't afford to create a false sense of security. ...

About four months ago, desperate to be near relatives and longing for small-town life again, they moved to Indiana.\n\nThey picked a home on about 2 acres of land, down rural country roads and tucked between cornfields. They wanted a spot to give the family space, to let the boys grow and prosper and to allow their older brother, Aza, 5, to thrive on his own.\n\nJadon plays with letters of the alphabet during a physical therapy session.\n\n\"I had reached a point where I couldn't do it anymore,\" Nicole said. \"I needed my mom. I needed just anyone who could come in my house and help me, because it was getting too hard.\n\n\"I needed to go home. The boys needed it, and Aza needed it.\"\n\nAll of that is on display as Aza flies around the house, hiding soft rubber letters for Jadon to pick up as if on a scavenger hunt. Jadon and Aza even ride the school bus together to attend day care.\n\n\"Jadon and Aza are both in school, and Anias goes to preschool one day a week,\" Christian said. \"So we're trying to be a normal family.\"\n\nWhen twins are joined at the head, one tends to be more dominant. In this case, Jadon was the dominant one, whose body worked overtime to keep both of them alive.\n\nJUST WATCHED A 360\u00b0 look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A 360\u00b0 look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery 06:16\n\nPost-surgery, Anias has struggled more with breathing and an array of other issues. He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals.\n\nAnias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down.\n\n\"It was horrific for me to watch,\" Nicole says. Anias had not \"just stopped development, but regressed in development.\"\n\nHe also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like \"raw meat.\" He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day.\n\n\"I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated,\" Nicole said.\n\nBut he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.\n\nOn the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents. \"Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use,\" it says.\n\n\"Anias had like Mount Everest medically,\" Nicole said. \"That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.\"\n\nChristian said, \"He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.\"\n\n'You just want him to fly'\n\nWhen CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.\n\nAnias lost most of his function over the last year, but his parents say they've begun to see major progress in the past few weeks.\n\n\"What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute,\" Nicole said. \"I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know.\"\n\nAs a mom, she says, \"you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground. That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.\n\n\"That's lifts us both,\" she said, \"and we're ready to help him take off.\n\n\"He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.\"\n\nShe's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like \"someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me.\" He often smiles at her encouraging words.\n\nBoth parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth.\n\nNicole says she will never stop advocating and fighting for her boys.\n\n\"The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me,\" Christian said. \"But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.\"\n\nHe says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: \"They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them.\"\n\nAt the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, \"Mommy, it's just an accident.\" She says he then looked at her and said, \"I am smart.\" She laughed and told him, \"You are smart.\" Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, \"I am funny.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively.

a prediction that had already disappointed investors.\n\nApple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November.\n\nThe festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter.\n\nBut revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016.\n\nIn a letter to investors on Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue.\n\n\"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones.\n\nThe rise and fall of Apple's share price in 2018\n\n'Mounting uncertainty'\n\nWednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years.\n\nIt appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off.\n\nProduction cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices.\n\n\"The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,\" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.\n\nAnalysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter\n\nTo sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't.\n\nThe economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse.\n\nThere's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard, as he has already, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business.\n\nBut there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated.\n\nBetter, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough.\n\nWill Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position?\n\nIt has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone.\n\nTrusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about.\n\nThe firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence.\n\n\"As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,\" Mr Cook wrote in the letter.\n\nHe added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong.\n\n\"While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml",

Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base.\n\nHinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, rather than banning women in a broad age group from entering at all.\n\nImage copyright Kaviyoor Santosh Image caption Police used tear gas to break up protests\n\nProtesters have consistently argued that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayappa.\n\nThey say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity, who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings.\n\nAccording to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy and hence, women of a certain age are not allowed into the temple.\n\nTwo other women had managed to reach the temple's premises in October, with more than 100 police protecting them from stone-throwing protesters as they walked the last 5km stretch to the shrine. But they were forced to turn around after a stand-off with devotees, just metres from Sabarimala's sanctum."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Apple blames China for sales forecast cut", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46742871", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP\n\nApple has rattled investors with news that its sales have been slowing, blaming economic weakness in China.\n\nIn a surprise disclosure, the iPhone maker said it anticipated revenue of about $84bn (\u00a367bn) for the three months to 29 December.\n\nIn November it forecast sales of at least $89bn - a prediction that had already disappointed investors.\n\nApple's share price sank more than 7% in after hours trade, extending its more than 28% slide since November.\n\nThe festive season is typically Apple's strongest quarter.\n\nBut revenue of $84bn would mark an almost 5% fall from the same period last year and represent the firm's first year-on-year quarterly decline since 2016.\n\nIn a letter to investors on Wednesday, chief executive Tim Cook said the firm's sales problems were primarily in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for almost 20% of its revenue.\n\n\"While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he added that developed markets saw troubles as well, as fewer customers than expected chose to upgrade to Apple's newest phones.\n\nThe rise and fall of Apple's share price in 2018\n\n'Mounting uncertainty'\n\nWednesday's cut to the sales forecast marked the first time Apple has revised its guidance to investors in more than 15 years.\n\nIt appeared to confirm doubts about the firm's prospects that have troubled investors in recent months, contributing to the broader market sell-off.\n\nProduction cuts by major suppliers had led to worries that the firm's newest phones were not gaining traction among buyers, in part due to high prices.\n\n\"The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple's aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company's longer-term pricing power within its iPhone franchise,\" said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.\n\nAnalysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter\n\nTo sum up what Mr Cook told investors: some of this is under Apple's control, and some of it isn't.\n\nThe economic realities in China - where growth is slowing - mean a region which Apple relied on heavily for new customers is no longer providing that boost. Coupled with a US-China trade war, this might get worse.\n\nThere's little Mr Cook can do about that, save lobbying hard, as he has already, for exemptions that help protect Apple's business.\n\nBut there's something else important at play here. The phenomenal smart phone era, a period that made Apple the world's richest company, is winding down. That isn't news. It's just happening more quickly than Apple had anticipated.\n\nBetter, more reliable devices, with longer-lasting batteries, mean people aren't desperate to upgrade at the end of their contract. And ask yourself: what exactly was new about the latest iPhone model? Not a lot. Not enough.\n\nWill Apple's other products and services be enough to sustain its position?\n\nIt has been trying to diversify what it does for some time with products like the Apple Watch and other online services, which have grown quickly but fall way short of the profit gained from the all-conquering iPhone.\n\nTrusted commentators are now expecting the company to make a major acquisition to give investors something to feel optimistic about.\n\nThe firm had warned investors in November that a strengthening dollar and economic weakness in some overseas markets would be likely to hurt sales in the last three months of the year.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted that Apple was vulnerable to the effects of the US-China trade spat, in part due to risk that the tensions could cause Chinese buyers to sour towards US brands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple said trade tensions had hurt consumer confidence.\n\n\"As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets, the effects appeared to reach consumers as well, with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed,\" Mr Cook wrote in the letter.\n\nHe added that Apple was taking steps to make it easier for customers to trade in their phones and said other parts of the firm's business, including services, remained strong.\n\n\"While it's disappointing to revise our guidance, our performance in many areas showed remarkable strength in spite of these challenges,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Hollywood burglary items recovered after arrest", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46745262", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:00:29", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright LAPD Image caption Benjamin Ackerman, 32, is alleged to have posed as a potential buyer or real estate agent\n\nA man has been arrested in connection with a series of burglaries targeting the homes of celebrities in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles police say.\n\nHundreds of stolen items said to be worth millions of dollars were found when investigators searched properties linked to Benjamin Ackerman, 32.\n\nMr Ackerman is alleged to have posed as a buyer to survey the homes before the burglaries, which began in 2017.\n\nAmong the victims are the musicians Usher and Adam Lambert, police said.\n\nThirteen victims have so far been identified.\n\nAnnouncing the arrest on Wednesday, Los Angeles Police Detective Jared Timmons said \"high value\" property was recovered by investigators from Mr Ackerman's home and a separate storage unit.\n\nImages of the items collected have been posted on a website to help police investigators identify any further victims in order to return them.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @LAPDHQ In approximately 5 minutes we will be LIVE from LAPD Headquarters to announce the arrest of a suspect in a series of celebrity/high-end home burglaries pic.twitter.com/RRJgR9SNO5 \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) January 2, 2019 Report\n\nMr Ackerman allegedly pretended to be a real estate agent or potential home buyer to access the properties at open houses and on some occasions falsely claimed to work for an investment firm, police said.\n\n\"When he showed up he was dressed to the nines.

The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nIs there a 'dark side of the Moon'?\n\nThe lunar far side is often referred to as the \"dark side\", though \"dark\" in this case means \"unseen\" rather than \"lacking light\". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and night-time.\n\nBut because of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThe far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the \"mare\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nHow will scientists keep track of the rover?\n\nIn an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: \"The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.\"\n\nSo the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao - or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May.\n\nQueqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.\n\nWhat are China's plans in space?\n\nChina wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia.\n\nIn 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIt will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station\n\nThe BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success.\n\nBut Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa.\n\n\"The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,\" he told the BBC.\n\nYe Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open.\n\n\"They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,\" he said.\n\nChina has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration.

The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.\n\nBut Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after.\n\nThe scientists have decided to call the larger lobe \"Ultima\", and the smaller lobe \"Thule\". The volume ratio is three to one.\n\nJeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: \"If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Overall, Ultima Thule is dark, but there is quite a bit of brightness variation\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption One of the probe's instruments recorded the colour (L) of Ultima Thule. This has been laid over the high-resolution B&W image (C) to produce a combination (R)\n\nThe new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).\n\nIt has a tinge of colour, however. \"We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,\" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI.\n\n\"Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices.\" Essentially, its surface has been \"burnt\" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption The New Horizons team is celebrating an extraordinary achievement\n\nPrincipal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach.\n\nThe probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard.\n\n\"[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,\" the SwRI scientist said.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nLess than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft.\n\nThe best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nProf Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau volcano: Satellites get clear view of collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46743362", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Planet Labs, Inc.

But generation per person is now back down to the level of the 1984 (around 5 megawatt hours per capita).\n\nHow much carbon has been reduced thanks to energy efficiency?\n\nIt\u2019s widely known that the great switch from coal power to renewables has helped the UK meet ambitions to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe report says the use of renewables reduced fossil fuel energy by the equivalent of 95 terawatt hours (TWh) between 2005 and now. And last year renewables supplied a record 33% share of UK electricity generation.\n\nBut in the meantime, humble energy efficiency has contributed to cutting energy demand by 103 TWh. In other words, in the carbon-cutting contest, efficiency has won \u2013 so far. And what\u2019s more, efficiency is uncontroversial, unlike wind and solar.\n\nWhat role has industry played?\n\nThe energy efficiency story doesn\u2019t just apply to households. There have been major strides amongst firms, too. Big supermarkets have worked hard to improve the performance of their lighting and refrigeration.\n\nAnd because firms and individuals are using less energy, that has offset the rise in energy prices. So whilst the prices have gone up, often bills have gone down.\n\nThe issue is complicated, though. Other factors have to be taken into account, such as energy imported via cables from mainland Europe, population growth and shifts from old energy-intensive industries.\n\nShould \u201cCinderella\u201d efficiency be allowed to shine?\n\nSimon Evans from Carbon Brief told BBC News: \u201cAlthough the picture is complex it\u2019s clear that energy efficiency has played a huge role in help the UK to decarbonise \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got the recognition it should have.\n\n\"Say you change from a B or C-rated fridge to an A++ rated fridge. That can halve your energy use from the appliance, so it\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has consistently said it champions energy efficiency, but campaigners say it could do more. The UN\u2019s climate body also supports energy efficiency as a major policy objective, although the issue features little in media coverage.\n\nBut supporters of efficiency argue that ratcheting up efficiency standards for everything from planes and cars to computer displays and freezers offers the best-value carbon reductions without the pain of confronting the public with restrictions on their lifestyle choices.\n\nJoanne Wade from the Association for Conservation of Energy told BBC News: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen these figures before but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\n\u201cThe huge improvement in energy efficiency tends to be completely ignored. People haven\u2019t noticed it because if efficiency improves, they are still able to have the energy services that they want. I suppose I should reluctantly agree that the fact that no-one notices it is part of its appeal.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Warming seas linked to bluefin tuna surge in UK waters", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46738175", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nGrowing numbers of bluefin tuna are being seen in the waters around the UK because of the warming impact of a long term ocean current say researchers.\n\nThese large, speedy fish are a globally endangered species and almost disappeared from the UK around 40 years ago.\n\nScientists say that their recent rise is connected to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).\n\nNow in a warm phase, the current makes UK waters more hospitable for the species.\n\nBluefin tuna are one of the largest and fastest fish on the planet - they can weigh up to 900kg and can travel at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour (43mph).\n\nIn the 1930s, the species was a common sight in the seas off Scarborough and was highly prized by big-game fishers.\n\nHowever, from the 1940s, the species began to decline and by the early 1990s had all but disappeared.\n\nBut over the past five years or so, sightings of the warm blooded fish have increased off the UK once again with many of these encounters captured on social media.\n\nThis situation has been mirrored in the Nordic seas, in the waters between Greenland and Norway which witnessed a spectacular collapse in tuna numbers in the 1960s, when the fish declined dramatically in just two years.\n\nResearchers now believe that the warming and cooling impact of the long term current, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is key to the ebb and flow of the species.\n\nThe scientists' new paper has been published in the journal Science Advances. The team looked at the changing abundance and distribution of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic over the past 200 years.\n\nThey've concluded that the major factor influencing the movement of bluefin is the AMO.\n\n\"The ecological effects of the AMO have long been overlooked and our results represent a breakthrough in understanding the history of bluefin tuna in the North Atlantic,\" said lead author Dr Robin Falllettaz from the University of Lille.\n\nHe believes that while current numbers of sightings of the UK may indicate that the species is doing well, this may not be the case everywhere.\n\n\"When water temperature increases during a positive AMO, bluefin tuna move further north. However, the most positive (warming) phases of the AMO also have a detrimental effect upon recruitment in the Mediterranean, which is currently the most important spawning ground, and that will affect adult abundance a few years later.\"\n\n\"If the AMO stays in a highly positive phase for several years, we may encounter more bluefin tuna in our waters but the overall population could actually be decreasing.\"\n\nWhat is the AMO?\n\nIt's a measure of a naturally occurring climate cycle in the North Atlantic that see sea surface temperatures rise and fall over long time periods.\n\nApproximately every 60 to 120 years the AMO switches between positive and negative phases. During positive (warm) phases, Ireland and the UK experience warmer weather but it also brings more hurricanes and drives drought in the US midwest. A cooler AMO can lead to drought in many parts of Africa.\n\nWill tuna fishing be allowed in the UK again?\n\nRight now the fishing of bluefin tuna in British waters is prohibited. But the recent rise in bluefin numbers has encouraged campaigners to petition the government to allow amateur fishers to catch the endangered species.\n\nThe Angling Trust want to establish a \"catch and release\" licensed fishery which would they believe would have enormous economic benefits for areas such as Cornwall.\n\nBut the scientists involved with the latest study are cautious about this approach.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bluefin numbers in the Mediterranean have declined while increasing around the UK\n\n\"Bluefin tuna have been extensively overfished during the 20th century and the stock was close to its lowest in 1990, a fact that further indicates the recent changes in distribution are most likely environmentally driven rather than due to fisheries management and stock recovery,\" said co-author Dr Richard Kirby from the Secchi Disk Foundation.\n\n\"Before we further exploit bluefin tuna either commercially or recreationally for sport fishing, we should consider whether it would be better to protect them by making the UK's seas a safe space for one of the ocean's most endangered top fish.\"\n\nWhat about climate change?\n\nAccording to experts, the impact of global warming on top of the AMO is likely to alter the familiar patterns seen in bluefin tuna over several hundred years.\n\nThe authors believe that increasing global temperatures may see the species persist for longer in cooler waters around the UK and in the Nordic seas.\n\nIt might also cause the fish to disappear from the Mediterranean sea, the world's most important bluefin fishery.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "New Year\u2019s Resolution", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/new-year-s-resolution-1831408235", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "Each year, Americans celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve by resolving to change some aspect of their lives.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "White House Talks: No Progress on Government Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-talks-no-progress-on-government-shutdown/4726895.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "The new Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives is expected to approve bills Thursday to end a partial government shutdown.

Yet his allies fear a primary challenge from a high-profile Republican could doom his re-election.\n\nThe concern was outlined in a private email shared among Republican National Committee members hours after the GOP's last failed presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, lashed out at Trump's character and global leadership in an opinion article published in The Washington Post. Romney is set to be sworn in as Utah's junior senator on Thursday.\n\nHis scathing message was widely interpreted as a sign of encouragement for Republicans including outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to take on Trump. While a successful primary challenge is highly unlikely given Trump's grip on the GOP base, some fear it would consume energy and resources badly needed by Trump, who is facing record-low approval ratings and signs of revolt among suburban voters.\n\nWin or lose, any primary challenge would almost certainly hurt Trump's re-election, warned RNC member Jevon Williams of the Virgin Islands.\n\n\"Messrs. Romney, Flake, and Kasich will continue chasing their fantasy of being president, even if that means destroying our party and denying President Trump re-election,'' Williams wrote to fellow RNC members in a message obtained by The Associated Press. \"Look, the political history is clear. No Republican president opposed for re-nomination has ever won re-election.''\n\nKasich was clearly encouraged by Romney's criticism of the president.\n\n\"Welcome to the fray, (at)MittRomney,'' Kasich wrote in a Twitter post Wednesday sharing Romney's article.\n\nKasich adviser John Weaver said it's been \"awful lonely'' for Kasich in recent years as one of the GOP's most vocal Trump critics.\n\n\"It's not so lonely now,'' Weaver said.\n\nKasich, who leaves office later this month, is taking steps to strengthen his organization ahead of a possible run by adding paid staff and volunteers to his political and finance teams.\n\nHis advisers say he has yet to decide whether to challenge Trump \u2014 either as a Republican or as an independent \u2014 although Kasich was quick to visit New Hampshire, the base of his last presidential run, after the November midterms.\n\nThe debate among Republicans is how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to protect Trump. Williams called on his RNC colleagues to change party rules to make it harder for a viable primary challenge to take shape.\n\n\u200bCurrently, any candidate who wins a plurality of delegates from five states can be nominated from the national convention floor. That number, which was higher in past years, was lowered at the 2016 convention in response to concerns from grassroots activists. Now some of those activists, loyal to Trump, fear the potential consequences.\n\nIncumbents in either party bring universal name recognition and massive institutional support to their re-election campaigns, and an insurgent effort to deny Trump the nomination would almost certainly fail. But there is still ample room for a potential spoiler to enter the race to try to deny Trump the support needed to win the general election.\n\nPrimary challengers in 1980 and 1992 helped weaken then-Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, who were ultimately defeated in November.\n\nStill, little has come of recent discussions in South Carolina and New Hampshire, where local officials hoped to take steps to block potential Trump challengers. RNC officials now say the national GOP's rules cannot be changed before the 2020 national convention.\n\nFormer RNC member Saul Anuzis of Michigan said Trump's team missed an opportunity.\n\n\"Nobody wants a primary. It's not healthy for us,'' Anuzis said. \"You'll have the Democrats attacking Trump and some Republicans attacking Trump. How does that help us?''\n\nTrump, whose party suffered deep losses in the November midterm elections, shrugged off the prospect of a serious primary challenge.\n\n\"They say I am the most popular president in the history of the Republican Party,'' he told reporters.\n\nGallup found late last month that just 39 percent of Americans approved of Trump's job performance, a mark lower than any president in either party at this point in his presidency since at least 1954. That said, 89 percent of Republicans approved of Trump's job performance.\n\nTrump's behavior could shift sharply in the second half of his first term as he prepares for the 2020 contest.\n\nThe president is facing pressure from the special counsel in the Russia probe and an impending onslaught of Democratic investigations. That could push Trump to cater exclusively to the base of voters he is concerned about losing, according to a Republican close to the White House who has consulted on the early re-election efforts.\n\nThat instinct would echo the president's double-down, scorched-earth response to the crises that hit his 2016 campaign, including the \"Access Hollywood'' tape about forcing himself on women, and could make it harder to woo the independent voters or disaffected Democrats he may well need.\n\nThe president is eager to unleash his re-election machinery and has pushed to collect pledges of loyalty from across the GOP to quell any hint of an insurrection, according to a campaign official and a Republican familiar with the inner workings of the campaign. Neither was authorized to speak publicly and both requested anonymity.\n\nThe Trump team has discussed the possibility of a challenge from someone such as Kasich or Flake and now, one adviser said, Romney would enter the conversation.\n\nMost in Trump's orbit were not worried about Romney, but others worried that the new article, which was published to great buzz, was merely the opening salvo in coordinated effort by some Republicans to deny the president the party's nomination.\n\nPublicly, RNC officials were united behind the president.\n\n\"There is no concern or expectation at the RNC of a primary challenge for President Trump at all,'' said RNC member Bill Palatucci of New Jersey, a state where Republicans suffered painful losses in November. \"There may be disagreements, but you express those disagreements in private. As difficult as a midterm cycle that we had, everybody still wants a Republican president and not Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.''\n\nRomney himself insisted that his article was not intended to signal any interest in a third Republican presidential bid, but he declined to endorse Trump's re-election.\n\n\"I haven't decided who I'm going to endorse in 2020,'' Romney said on CNN. He continued: \"I'm not running again. We'll see if someone else does in a Republican primary or not. Time will tell.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Former US House Speaker Set to Reclaim Gavel", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nancy-pelosi-former-us-house-speaker-set-to-reclaim-gavel/4726842.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Nancy Pelosi is once again Washington's most powerful woman, poised to reclaim the U.S. House of Representatives speaker's gavel Thursday as opponent-in-chief to an impulsive and unpredictable president.\n\nKeeping Donald Trump in check will be among the California Democrat's top challenges as she presides over the House of Representatives through the 2020 elections, when her party aims to dethrone the Republican commander in chief.\n\nPelosi is almost certain to win Thursday's House vote for speaker, a position she held for four years from 2007, when she made history as the first woman ever to rise to that post.\n\nWhen outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan yields to the 78-year-old, she will again become the nation's third most senior official and seal her reputation as one of the great survivors in American politics.\n\nIn her first stint, Pelosi was a strong opposing force to Republican George W.

But she shrewdly navigated a simmering party power struggle that saw dozens of House Democrats and candidates signaling their desire for change at the top.\n\nThe internal resistance largely stems from Pelosi's broad unpopularity among voters. But in an interview published Wednesday, she pushed back at the notion that she is reviled.\n\n\"I don't necessarily feel hated. I feel respected,\" she told Elle magazine. \"They wouldn't come after me if I were not effective.\"\n\nFirst elected in 1987\n\nAt least in part, Pelosi's reputation is shaped by years of rightwing attacks. Conservatives depict her, the wife of an investment millionaire from California, as the embodiment of a leftist elite.\n\nShe is accused of everything from wanting to raise taxes for middle-class families to supporting a massive influx of illegal immigrants.\n\nFor three decades, Pelosi has represented California's 12th congressional district, which includes San Francisco, a stronghold of left-wing politics, counter-culture and gay rights regarded by many heartland conservatives as a true Gomorrah.\n\nNancy Patricia D'Alesandro was born in Baltimore to a political family with Italian roots.

decades later, the 61-year-old stood Wednesday in front of a throng of news cameras outside the downtown Chicago headquarters of the Catholic archdiocese in this sprawling American city, and demanded the church listen to survivors.\n\n\"They've counted on our silence,\" Marchant said. \"The horror of what happened to each of us needs to be out and spoken.\"\n\nMarchant was joined by leaders of two survivors' advocacy groups who sent an open letter to Pope Francis asking to be a part of a historic gathering that the Catholic leader called for in February at the Vatican, to discuss the ongoing crisis roiling the church.\n\nAt issue was the very credibility of the pope's conference, they claimed, and whether survivors would have faith in its outcome.\n\n\"What we want is for this summit to be able to be taken seriously and to result in real, meaningful reform,\" said Zach Hiner, executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP).\n\nThe demands came just as U.S. bishops gathered at a Chicago-area seminary for a prayer summit in advance of the Vatican meeting.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was tight-lipped about the gathering, saying only that it would consist of seven days of silent prayer and reflection.\n\nTwo of the attendees were targeted by the activists in downtown Chicago for their key roles in the upcoming Vatican event: Cardinal Blase Cupich, the leader of the Chicago archdiocese, and U.S. bishops leader Cardinal Daniel DiNardo.\n\nBoth were blamed for alleged cover-ups of clergy abuse under their watch.\n\n\"We're asking the pope to do something very simple: put individuals to lead your summit that have not covered up for child sex crimes,\" said Peter Isely, a self-identified survivor and spokesman for the group Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA).\n\n\"Then, survivors and the rest of the world might have a glimmer of hope.\"\n\nSurvivors' advocates have long accused church officials of slow-walking abuse investigations and failing to disclose all allegations.\n\nMarchant said her abuser was allowed to remain a priest for almost two decades after she first reported him.\n\n\"The church has a history of minimizing and denying the undeniable pain and horror of being sexually abused by a priest,\" said Marchant, who is now a therapist helping other clergy abuse survivors.\n\nThe new demands came two weeks after the top prosecutor in the Midwestern state of Illinois, where Chicago is located, revealed hundreds of previously undisclosed allegations of clergy abuse.\n\nIn a scathing report, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said church officials mishandled investigations and failed to inform law enforcement of all accusations.\n\nMore than 500 additional accused clergy were uncovered by state investigators within months of looking into dioceses' records, according to Madigan, far more than the 185 names previously disclosed.\n\nCardinal Cupich acknowledged that more reforms were needed.\n\n\"There can be no doubt about the constant need to strengthen our culture of healing, protection, and accountability,\" he said in December statement.\n\nThe scale of the apparent cover-up

Yet his allies fear a primary challenge from a high-profile Republican could doom his re-election.\n\nThe concern was outlined in a private email shared among Republican National Committee members hours after the GOP's last failed presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, lashed out at Trump's character and global leadership in an opinion article published in The Washington Post. Romney is set to be sworn in as Utah's junior senator on Thursday.\n\nHis scathing message was widely interpreted as a sign of encouragement for Republicans including outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to take on Trump. While a successful primary challenge is highly unlikely given Trump's grip on the GOP base, some fear it would consume energy and resources badly needed by Trump, who is facing record-low approval ratings and signs of revolt among suburban voters.\n\nWin or lose, any primary challenge would almost certainly hurt Trump's re-election, warned RNC member Jevon Williams of the Virgin Islands.\n\n\"Messrs. Romney, Flake, and Kasich will continue chasing their fantasy of being president, even if that means destroying our party and denying President Trump re-election,'' Williams wrote to fellow RNC members in a message obtained by The Associated Press. \"Look, the political history is clear. No Republican president opposed for re-nomination has ever won re-election.''\n\nKasich was clearly encouraged by Romney's criticism of the president.\n\n\"Welcome to the fray, (at)MittRomney,'' Kasich wrote in a Twitter post Wednesday sharing Romney's article.\n\nKasich adviser John Weaver said it's been \"awful lonely'' for Kasich in recent years as one of the GOP's most vocal Trump critics.\n\n\"It's not so lonely now,'' Weaver said.\n\nKasich, who leaves office later this month, is taking steps to strengthen his organization ahead of a possible run by adding paid staff and volunteers to his political and finance teams.\n\nHis advisers say he has yet to decide whether to challenge Trump \u2014 either as a Republican or as an independent \u2014 although Kasich was quick to visit New Hampshire, the base of his last presidential run, after the November midterms.\n\nThe debate among Republicans is how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to protect Trump. Williams called on his RNC colleagues to change party rules to make it harder for a viable primary challenge to take shape.\n\n\u200bCurrently, any candidate who wins a plurality of delegates from five states can be nominated from the national convention floor. That number, which was higher in past years, was lowered at the 2016 convention in response to concerns from grassroots activists. Now some of those activists, loyal to Trump, fear the potential consequences.\n\nIncumbents in either party bring universal name recognition and massive institutional support to their re-election campaigns, and an insurgent effort to deny Trump the nomination would almost certainly fail. But there is still ample room for a potential spoiler to enter the race to try to deny Trump the support needed to win the general election.\n\nPrimary challengers in 1980 and 1992 helped weaken then-Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, who were ultimately defeated in November.\n\nStill, little has come of recent discussions in South Carolina and New Hampshire, where local officials hoped to take steps to block potential Trump challengers. RNC officials now say the national GOP's rules cannot be changed before the 2020 national convention.\n\nFormer RNC member Saul Anuzis of Michigan said Trump's team missed an opportunity.\n\n\"Nobody wants a primary. It's not healthy for us,'' Anuzis said. \"You'll have the Democrats attacking Trump and some Republicans attacking Trump. How does that help us?''\n\nTrump, whose party suffered deep losses in the November midterm elections, shrugged off the prospect of a serious primary challenge.\n\n\"They say I am the most popular president in the history of the Republican Party,'' he told reporters.\n\nGallup found late last month that just 39 percent of Americans approved of Trump's job performance, a mark lower than any president in either party at this point in his presidency since at least 1954. That said, 89 percent of Republicans approved of Trump's job performance.\n\nTrump's behavior could shift sharply in the second half of his first term as he prepares for the 2020 contest.\n\nThe president is facing pressure from the special counsel in the Russia probe and an impending onslaught of Democratic investigations. That could push Trump to cater exclusively to the base of voters he is concerned about losing, according to a Republican close to the White House who has consulted on the early re-election efforts.\n\nThat instinct would echo the president's double-down, scorched-earth response to the crises that hit his 2016 campaign, including the \"Access Hollywood'' tape about forcing himself on women, and could make it harder to woo the independent voters or disaffected Democrats he may well need.\n\nThe president is eager to unleash his re-election machinery and has pushed to collect pledges of loyalty from across the GOP to quell any hint of an insurrection, according to a campaign official and a Republican familiar with the inner workings of the campaign. Neither was authorized to speak publicly and both requested anonymity.\n\nThe Trump team has discussed the possibility of a challenge from someone such as Kasich or Flake and now, one adviser said, Romney would enter the conversation.\n\nMost in Trump's orbit were not worried about Romney, but others worried that the new article, which was published to great buzz, was merely the opening salvo in coordinated effort by some Republicans to deny the president the party's nomination.\n\nPublicly, RNC officials were united behind the president.\n\n\"There is no concern or expectation at the RNC of a primary challenge for President Trump at all,'' said RNC member Bill Palatucci of New Jersey, a state where Republicans suffered painful losses in November. \"There may be disagreements, but you express those disagreements in private. As difficult as a midterm cycle that we had, everybody still wants a Republican president and not Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.''\n\nRomney himself insisted that his article was not intended to signal any interest in a third Republican presidential bid, but he declined to endorse Trump's re-election.\n\n\"I haven't decided who I'm going to endorse in 2020,'' Romney said on CNN. He continued: \"I'm not running again. We'll see if someone else does in a Republican primary or not. Time will tell.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Nancy Pelosi: Former US House Speaker Set to Reclaim Gavel", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nancy-pelosi-former-us-house-speaker-set-to-reclaim-gavel/4726842.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Nancy Pelosi is once again Washington's most powerful woman, poised to reclaim the U.S. House of Representatives speaker's gavel Thursday as opponent-in-chief to an impulsive and unpredictable president.\n\nKeeping Donald Trump in check will be among the California Democrat's top challenges as she presides over the House of Representatives through the 2020 elections, when her party aims to dethrone the Republican commander in chief.\n\nPelosi is almost certain to win Thursday's House vote for speaker, a position she held for four years from 2007, when she made history as the first woman ever to rise to that post.\n\nWhen outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan yields to the 78-year-old, she will again become the nation's third most senior official and seal her reputation as one of the great survivors in American politics.\n\nIn her first stint, Pelosi was a strong opposing force to Republican George W. Bush in the final two years of his presidency. Her role as a restraint on Trump would be similar.\n\nBut she will also need to keep the reins tight on her own caucus, some of whose newly empowered progressives are seeking swift punitive measures against Trump in the coming months.\n\nShe and the Democratic leadership would have the power to block Republican legislation, hamstringing large parts of Trump's agenda ranging from proposed new tax cuts to building a wall on the border with Mexico.\n\nAnd Pelosi could make life for Trump much harder if she uses subpoena power to compel administration officials to testify before Congress or turn over key documents, or if she launches impeachment proceedings.\n\nSo far, she has spoken out against using such a powerful political cudgel against him, arguing that the explosive step would likely mobilize Republican voters eager to protect the president.\n\nIn her reprised role, she will have to thread a political needle, standing up to Trump when needed but also showing that her party is capable of working with the president to pass legislation.\n\nHer immediate task: finding a way to help end a standoff over Trump's border wall demand that has led to a partial government shutdown now stretching to 13 days.\n\nPelosi and other congressional leaders met with Trump Wednesday but failed to secure a deal to end the impasse.\n\nThree weeks earlier, at a remarkable Oval Office confrontation with cameras rolling, Pelosi showed she was not afraid to go toe to toe with Trump in a public forum when he appeared to belittle her effort to secure support for her speakership.\n\n\"Please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\" a defiant Pelosi said.\n\n'Respected,' not hated\n\nPelosi is unquestionably among the savviest political leaders of her generation. She shepherded then president Barack Obama's health law through the House to its contentious, historic passage in 2010.\n\nPerhaps for that reason she is still seen by some as a liability eight years later, with Republicans presenting her as the ultimate liberal bogeywoman.\n\n\"Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House?\" Trump asked a crowd at a Minnesota rally in October. \"Don't do that to me!\"\n\nPelosi's big comeback was no foregone conclusion. But she shrewdly navigated a simmering party power struggle that saw dozens of House Democrats and candidates signaling their desire for change at the top.\n\nThe internal resistance largely stems from Pelosi's broad unpopularity among voters. But in an interview published Wednesday, she pushed back at the notion that she is reviled.\n\n\"I don't necessarily feel hated. I feel respected,\" she told Elle magazine. \"They wouldn't come after me if I were not effective.\"\n\nFirst elected in 1987\n\nAt least in part, Pelosi's reputation is shaped by years of rightwing attacks. Conservatives depict her, the wife of an investment millionaire from California, as the embodiment of a leftist elite.\n\nShe is accused of everything from wanting to raise taxes for middle-class families to supporting a massive influx of illegal immigrants.\n\nFor three decades, Pelosi has represented California's 12th congressional district, which includes San Francisco, a stronghold of left-wing politics, counter-culture and gay rights regarded by many heartland conservatives as a true Gomorrah.\n\nNancy Patricia D'Alesandro was born in Baltimore to a political family with Italian roots. Both her father and brother were mayors of the East Coast port city.\n\nAfter studying political science in Washington, she moved with her husband to San Francisco, where they raised five children.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 1987, Pelosi rose through the ranks to lead the chamber's Democrats beginning in 2002.\n\nSteeled by countless political struggles, Pelosi has largely managed to hold her diverse caucus together.\n\nU.S. politics requires donning \"a suit of armor\" and the ability \"to take a punch,\" she has said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "2019 Promises to Be Big Year in Space", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/promises-to-be-big-year-in-space/4726781.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of mankind's first steps on the moon, so it is fitting that there are a number of exciting projects pushing us back into space.

It is 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, based on early, fuzzy images taken the day before, scientists said Ultima Thule resembled a bowling pin. But when better, closer pictures arrived, a new consensus emerged Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"The bowling pin is gone. It's a snowman!\" lead scientist Alan Stern informed the world from Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory , home to Mission Control. The bowling pin image is \"so 2018,\" joked Stern, who is with the Southwest Research Institute.\n\n\n\nThe celestial body was nicknamed Ultima Thule \u2014 meaning \"beyond the known world\" \u2014 before scientists could say for sure whether it was one object or two. With the arrival of the photos, they are now calling the bigger sphere Ultima and the smaller one Thule.\n\n\n\nThule is estimated to be 9 miles (14 kilometers) across, while Ultima is thought to be 12 miles (19 kilometers).\n\n\n\nScientist Jeff Moore of NASA's Ames Research Center said the two spheres formed when icy, pebble-size pieces coalesced in space billions of years ago. Then the spheres slowly spiraled closer to each other until they gently touched \u2014 as slowly as parking a car here on Earth at just a mile or two per hour \u2014 and stuck together.\n\n\n\nDespite the slender connection point, the two lobes are \"soundly bound\" together, according to Moore.\n\n\n\nScientists have ascertained that the object takes about 15 hours to make a full rotation. If it were spinning fast \u2014 say, one rotation every three or four hours \u2014 the two spheres would rip apart.\n\n\n\nStern noted that the team has received less than 1 percent of all the data stored aboard New Horizons. It will take nearly two years to get it all.\n\n\n\nThe two-lobed object is what is known as a \"contact binary.\" It is the first contact binary NASA has ever explored. Having formed 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system taking shape, it is also the most primitive object seen up close like this.\n\n\n\nAbout the size of a city, Ultima Thule has a mottled appearance and is the color of dull brick, probably because of the effects of radiation bombarding the icy surface, with brighter and darker regions.\n\n\n\nBoth spheres are similarly red, while the barely perceptible neck connecting the two lobes is noticeably less red, probably because of particles falling down the steep slopes into that area.\n\n\n\nSo far, no moons or rings have been detected. And scientists said there were no obvious impact craters in the latest photos but a few apparent \"divots\" and suggestions of hills and ridges. But better images should yield definitive answers in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n\n\nClues about the surface composition of Ultima Thule should start rolling in by Thursday. Scientists believe the icy exterior is probably a mix of water, methane and nitrogen, among other things.\n\n\n\nThe snowman picture was taken a half-hour before the spacecraft's closest approach early Tuesday, from a distance of about 18,000 miles (28,000 kilometers).\n\n\n\nUltima Thule is an exquisite time machine \u2014 the most primitive object ever seen close up \u2014 that should provide clues to the origins of our solar system.\n\n\n\nIt's neither a comet nor an asteroid, according to Stern, but rather \"a primordial planetesimal.\" Unlike comets and other objects that have been altered by the sun over time, Ultima Thule is in its pure, original state: It's been in the deep-freeze Kuiper Belt on the fringes of our solar system from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\"This thing was born somewhere between 99 percent and 99.9 percent of the way back to T-zero (liftoff) in our solar system, really amazing,\" Stern said. He added: \"We've never seen anything like this before. It's not fish or fowl. It's something that's completely different.\"\n\n\n\nStill, he said, when all the data comes in, \"there are going to be mysteries of Ultima Thule that we can't figure out.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Women Strive to End Genital Mutilation\u00a0in Kurdish Iraq", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/women-strive-to-end-genital-mutilation-in-kurdish-iraq/4726195.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Dark skies were threatening rain over an Iraqi Kurdistan village, but one woman refused to budge from outside a house where two girls were at risk of female genital mutilation.\n\n\n\n\"I know you're home!

When eight women entered the mosque, she patiently described FGM's dangers.\n\n\n\nAt the end, a thin woman approached Rasul and said her neighbor was planning to mutilate her two toddlers.\n\nThat sent Rasul clambering up the muddy pathway to the house, first knocking, then frantically demanding to be allowed in.\n\n\n\nBut the door remained shut.\n\n\n\n\"We are changing people's convictions. That's why it's so hard,\" Rasul told AFP, reluctantly walking away.\n\n\n\n'Just a child'\n\n\n\nFGM appears to have been practiced for decades in Iraq's Kurdish region, usually known for more progressive stances on women's rights.\n\n\n\nVictims are usually between 4 and 5 years old but are affected for years by bleeding, extremely reduced sexual sensitivity, tearing during childbirth, and depression.\n\n\n\nThe procedure can prove fatal, with some girls dying from blood loss or infection.\n\n\n\nAfter years of campaigning, Kurdish authorities banned FGM under a 2011 domestic violence law, slapping perpetrators with up to three years in prison and a roughly $80,000 fine.\n\n\n\nThe numbers have dropped steadily since.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) survey found 58.5 percent of women in the Kurdish region had been mutilated.\n\n\n\nThis year, UNICEF found a lower rate: 37.5 percent of girls aged 15-49 in the Kurdish region had undergone FGM.\n\n\n\nIt compares with less than 1 percent across the rest of Iraq, which has no FGM legislation.\n\n\n\n\"She cut me, I was hurt and cried,\" said Shukriyeh, 61, of the day her mother mutilated her more than 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\"I was just a child. How could I be angry at my mother?\"\n\n\n\nShukriyeh's six daughters, the youngest of whom is 26, have all been cut, too. But with so much campaigning against FGM, they have declined to do the same to their girls.\n\nYears ago, Zeinab, 38. allowed female relatives to cut her eldest daughter, then 3.\n\n\n\n\"I was so scared that I stayed far away and came to wash her after they cut her,\" she recalled, squirming.\n\n\n\nAfter WADI's sessions, she protected her other two daughters from mutilation.\n\n\n\n\"At the time I accepted [it], but now I wouldn't. Yes, I regret it. But what can I do now?\"\n\n\n\n'Women against women'\n\nRasul told AFP it was hard to combat a form of gender-based violence that women themselves practiced.\n\n\n\n\"Young men and women agree FGM should stop.

The spacecraft zoomed within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of it, more than three times closer than the Pluto flyby.\n\nOperating on autopilot, New Horizons was out of radio contact with controllers at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory from late Monday afternoon until late Tuesday morning. Scientists wanted the spacecraft staring down Ultima Thule and collecting data, not turning toward Earth to phone home.\n\nMission operations manager Alice Bowman said she was more nervous this time than she was with Pluto in 2015 because of the challenges and distance, so vast that messages take more than six hours, one way, to cross the 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers). When a solid radio link finally was acquired and team members reported that their spacecraft systems were green, or good, she declared with relief: \u201cWe have a healthy spacecraft.'' Later, she added to more applause: \u201cWe did it again.''\n\nFlyby earns standing ovation\n\nCheers erupted in the control center and in a nearby auditorium, where hundreds more \u2014 still weary from the double countdowns on New Year's Eve \u2014 gathered to await word. Scientists and other team members embraced and shared high-fives, while the spillover auditorium crowd gave a standing ovation.\n\nStern, Bowman and other key players soon joined their friends in the auditorium, where the celebration continued and a news conference took place. The speakers took delight in showing off the latest picture of Ultima Thule , taken just several hundred-thousand miles (1 million kilometers) before the 12:33 a.m. close approach.\n\n\u201cUltima Thule is finally revealing its secrets to us,'' said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins.\n\nBased on the early, rudimentary images, Ultima Thule is highly elongated \u2014 about 20 miles by 10 miles (32 kilometers by 16 kilometers). It's also spinning end over end, although scientists don't yet know how fast.\n\nAs for its shape, scientists say there are two possibilities.\n\nUltima Thule is either one object with two connected lobes, sort of like a spinning bowling pin or peanut still in the shell, or two objects orbiting surprisingly close to one another. A single body is more likely, they noted. An answer should be forthcoming Wednesday, once better, closer pictures arrive.\n\nBy week's end, \u201cUltima Thule is going to be a completely different world, compared to what we're seeing now,'' Weaver noted.\n\nColor close-ups in February\n\nStill, the best color close-ups won't be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons' data to reach Earth.\n\nThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\n\n\u201cThis mission's always been about delayed gratification,'' Stern reminded reporters. He noted it took 12 years to sell the project, five years to build it and nine years to reach the first target, Pluto.\n\nIts mission now totaling $800 million, the baby grand piano-sized New Horizons will keep hurtling toward the edge of the solar system, observing Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, from afar, and taking cosmic particle measurements. Although NASA's Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\n\nNext flyby 2020\n\nThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\n\nBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it \u201cwill keep going on and on.''\n\n\u201cThere's a bit of all of us on that spacecraft,'' she said, \u201cand it will continue after we're long gone here on Earth.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "2019 Promises to Be Big Year in Space", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/promises-to-be-big-year-in-space/4726781.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of mankind's first steps on the moon, so it is fitting that there are a number of exciting projects pushing us back into space.

But the company is unprofitable for the first nine months of 2018, and cash flow remains a concern for investors.\n\nPressure to deliver on promise\n\nMusk has been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the Model 3, which is seen crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability. It said it was churning out almost 1,000 Model 3s daily, broadly in line with Musk's promises but slightly short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe company said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February.\n\nThe price cut of $2,000 beginning on Wednesday on the Model 3 \u2014 as well as on its higher-priced Model S and Model X \u2014 took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock, pushing it down 9.4 percent in morning trade. Shares were last down 6.7 percent at $310.48.\n\nThe price cut comes as automakers expect U.S. new vehicle sales to weaken in 2019, and increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants. Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount.\n\nUnder a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in 2017, tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.\n\n\"The price cut is what's driving the stock lower, as it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollars is a material headwind,\" said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners.\n\nBut some said fears of eroded demand were overblown. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled, on average, to a 3-percent discount on a Tesla. If Tesla had a demand issue, therefore, the company would have cut its prices by more than 3 percent, he wrote in a note.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, General Motors said it had sold its 200,000th electric vehicle in 2018, similarly triggering a phase-out of the federal tax credit, according to a source.\n\nEffect on profit?\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett estimated in a client note that if Tesla continues to deliver cars at the current rate, the price cut will mean $700 million in lost revenue in 2019.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives, meanwhile, said the price cut was \"a potential positive\" for demand, \"but not what the bulls wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line.\"\n\nTesla delivered 63,150 Model 3s in its fourth quarter, falling short of FactSet estimates of 64,900. Tesla said that based on its own compilation of analysts' forecasts, its delivery numbers were in line with market expectations.\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy wrote that the numbers were in line with market consensus, though below the bank's estimate of 71,500 Model 3s.\n\nDeliveries rise, forecasts missed\n\nTotal deliveries rose from the third quarter to 90,700 cars, but missed forecasts, which had been influenced by analysts' expectations of a surge in buyers looking to cash in on the tax credit before year-end.\n\nThe automaker's third-quarter pre-tax profit was around $3,200 per vehicle delivered, but for the first nine months of 2018 the company suffered a third-quarter loss per vehicle delivered of $8,019, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nOverall, total production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles. The company churned out 61,394 Model 3s, up from a total of 53,239 Model 3s in the third quarter.\n\n\"Tesla disappointed the market.

They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper.\n\nAcross India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cHe was drunk,\u201d said one nun, beginning her story. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to say no,\u201d said another.\n\nAt its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them.\n\nThe Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year.\n\nNow, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country \u2014 India \u2014 and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people \u2014 nuns, former nuns and priests, and others \u2014 said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.\n\nStill, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest\u2019s sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified.\n\nBut this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open.\n\nWhen repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India\u2019s Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop\u2019s arrest.\n\nIt was an unprecedented action, dividing India\u2019s Catholic community. Inside the accuser\u2019s convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out.\n\n\u201cSome people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, \u2018You are worshipping Satan,\u2019\u201d said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. \u201cBut we need to stand up for the truth.\u201d\n\nVilloonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church.\n\n\u201cWe want to die as sisters,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nSome nuns\u2019 accounts date back decades \u2014 like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s.\n\nIt was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her \u2014 happily \u2014 to convent life.\n\n\u201cWe have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,\u201d she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. \u201cWe take one week off and we go for prayers and silence.\u201d\n\nShe had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection.\n\nThe nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India\u2019s poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families.\n\nBut when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she\u2019s afraid to be overheard in the empty room: \u201cI felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction.\u201d\n\nHe was in his 60s. She was four decades younger.\n\nOne night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room.\n\n\u2033\u2018I need to meet you,\u2019\u201d he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not stable. I\u2019m not ready to meet you,\u201d she told him.\n\nBut the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could.\n\nWeeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: \u201cIt was such a terrifying experience.\u201d\n\nAfterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned.\n\nBut nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career.\n\nShe was too afraid to challenge him openly.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was risking my own vocation.\u201d\n\nSo the fierce nun remained silent.\n\n___\n\nCatholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her.\n\n\u201cIt is a sin!\u201d Maria is said to have cried out. \u201cGod does not want it!\u201d\n\nBut for a nun, fighting off a priest\u2019s advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience \u2014 even if it\u2019s forced \u2014 faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,\u201d said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. \u201cThat fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone.\n\nThen there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes.\n\nCaught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,\u201d said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. \u201cIt can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman.\n\n\u201cOnce you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,\u201d said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. \u201cWe have a terrible taboo about sex.\u201d\n\nThat naivety, she said, can be costly.\n\nLike the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony.\n\nShe shook her head: \u201cI was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable.\u201d\n\nAt one point, she brought the priest\u2019s laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her.\n\nAt first, she had no idea what was happening.\n\n\u201cThe kissing was all coming here,\u201d she said, gesturing at her chest.\n\nThe confusion of that day is still clear on her face: \u201cI was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: \u2018Is this the way that Goans kiss?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe quickly understood what was happening but couldn\u2019t escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: \u201cI cannot shout! He\u2019s a priest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to offend him. I didn\u2019t want to make him feel bad,\u201d she said.\n\nSo she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door.\n\nShe quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest\u2019s room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint.\n\nA complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order.\n\nIn the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping.\n\nArchbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse \u201ckind of sporadic. Once here, once there.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cmany people don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey may talk in the community, but they don\u2019t want to bring it to the public, to the court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops.\n\nThe silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value.\n\nThere are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that\u2019s a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners.\n\n\u201cEven we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,\u201d said Mulackal, the theologian. \u201cA woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala.\n\nSet amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child\u2019s wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum.\n\nThe rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal.\n\nSmart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments.\n\nThe nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her.\n\nThe letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent\u2019s visitor logs.\n\nMulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were \u201cbaseless and concocted\u201d and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job.\n\n\u201cI am going through painful agony,\u201d said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. \u201cI tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail.\u201d\n\nCatholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners\u2019 faith: St. Mary\u2019s Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries.\n\nAround here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr.\n\nA string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. \u201cHearty Welcome!\u201d a banner proclaimed.\n\nBut at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf.\n\n\u201cNobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,\u201d said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls \u201cour survivor sister.\u201d\n\nThat sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher.\n\nShe knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser\u2019s friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship.\n\nIt was about fear.\n\n\u201cThe bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?\u201d asked Villoonnickal. \u201cIf she went home what will happen to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,\u201d she continued.\n\nEventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police.\n\nShe also went to confession.\n\nThere, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop.\n\n\u2033\u2018Even if you have to die, don\u2019t submit yourself.\u2019\u201d the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. \u201d\u2018Be courageous.\u2019\u201d\n\nCatholic authorities have said little about the case, with India\u2019s Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course.\n\n\u201cSilence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe request prayers for the Church at this difficult time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIn Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as \u201cMadhilu Chadi\u201d \u2014 Wall Jumpers. It\u2019s a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life.\n\nThose who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them. Their lives have direction, purpose. Those who leave often find themselves adrift in India, searching for new identities and spurned by families and friends. The events that knit families together \u2014 weddings, funerals, reunions \u2014 are suddenly off-limits. The emotional toll can be immense.\n\nSpeaking up about the church\u2019s troubles, many nuns say, could end with them forced from their convents, cut off in many ways from what they\u2019ve always known.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fear of being isolated if I speak the truth,\u201d said the nun who fought off the drunken priest. \u201cIf you do that, you have to go against your own community, your own religious superiors.\u201d\n\nThe result is an engulfing silence. Silence is the armor that sisters use to protect themselves and the lives they have created, even if it also means struggling with their memories, and protecting the men who abused them.\n\nIn the end, most say nothing."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Protests Erupt In India After Women Defy Menstruation Ban At Hindu Temple", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protests-erupt-in-india-after-women-defy-menstruation-ban-at-hindu-temple_us_5c2cbeb8e4b0407e9086baef", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Two women defied a centuries-old ban on entering a Hindu temple in the Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, sparking protests and calls for a strike by conservative Hindu groups outraged by their visit.\n\nPolice fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse a large crowd of protesters in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, television news channels showed.\n\nThere were protests in several other cities in the state, media reported.\n\nIndia\u2019s Supreme Court in September ordered the lifting of the ban on women or girls of menstruating age from entering the Sabarimala temple, which draws millions of worshippers a year.

The ban was imposed on all females between the ages of 10 and 50.\n\nNews channels reported the chief priest briefly shut the temple for \u201cpurification\u201d rituals after the women visited. Later, media reported it had re-opened.\n\nThe two women, identified by police as Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanaka Durga, 44, had tried to go in on Dec. 24, and later approached police for help, an officer said.\n\n\u201cThere was an elaborate arrangement for them to come just after the temple was opened early morning,\u201d said the officer, who declined to be identified fearing reprisals from protesters. \u201cThe darkness gave them, and us, cover.\u201d\n\nPolice were guarding the homes of the women after they left the temple and were prepared to let more women enter the temple, he said.\n\nA video from a police official posted online by ANI showed two women in the temple with their heads covered. Ammini told a television channel about their stealthy trek to the temple in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cWe reached Pampa, the main entry point to the temple at 1.30 a.m. and sought police protection ... We walked two hours, entered the temple around 3.30 a.m. and did the darshan,\u201d the woman said, referring to a ritual of standing in front of the temple\u2019s Hindu image.\n\nThe state government defended its decision to protect the women as they went into the temple, saying it was a matter of civil rights.\n\n\u201cI had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any women come forward to enter the temple,\u201d said Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\nVijayan told a news conference the women faced no obstruction on Wednesday.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) voiced his opposition to any House rules package that includes \"pay-go,\" a pay-as-you-go rule requiring Congress to offset any new spending it enacts.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 A small group of progressive lawmakers are trying to derail a fiscally conservative proposal put forward by the incoming House Democratic leadership \u2015 one that could potentially block votes on ambitious policy proposals like Medicare for All unless it\u2019s completely paid for.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go rules, commonly known as \u201cpay-go,\u201d would require Congress to offset any increased spending with equal cuts or revenue increases elsewhere. The provision is contained in a larger package of rules for the incoming 116th Congress, which convenes on Thursday.\n\nThe fact that Democrats are using their newfound power to stress fiscal responsibility is baffling to some progressives. Fiscal responsibility was hardly mentioned in the 2018 elections, whereas big legislative ideas \u2015 which could be harmed by pay-go rules \u2015 were popular with voters.\n\nBut the incoming leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), said they will not oppose the overall House rules package based on the pay-go provision because they\u2019re satisfied with promises from Democratic leaders that they would waive pay-go if it interfered with significant bills, including Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cWith the assurances that PAYGO can be waived, we do plan to vote for the House rules package and proceed with legislation to fix the statute,\u201d Jayapal and Pocan said in a joint statement.\n\nIf leadership waives pay-go rules, it would allow such legislation to come up for a vote on the House floor and for the House to pass it.\n\nBut that legislation would still not be able to become law unless both chambers of Congress voted to exempt it from \u201cstatutory pay-go,\u201d a restriction enshrined in law that leadership alone cannot change.\n\nJayapal and Pocan said they plan to introduce legislation reversing statutory pay-go in the coming Congress as well.\n\nBut some CPC members aren\u2019t as assured by leadership\u2019s promises.\n\nI will be voting NO on the Rules package with #PayGo. It is terrible economics. The austerians were wrong about the Great Recession and Great Depression. At some point, politicians need to learn from mistakes and read economic history. @paulkrugman @StephanieKelton @RBReich https://t.co/avimV0SU4t \u2014 Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) January 2, 2019\n\nTomorrow I will also vote No on the rules package, which is trying to slip in #PAYGO.\n\n\n\nPAYGO isn\u2019t only bad economics, as @RoKhanna explains; it\u2019s also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.\n\n\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t hinder ourselves from the start. https://t.co/WW3UaBs7vh \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 2, 2019\n\nKhanna was responding to a tweet from Warren Gunnels, policy director to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), effectively challenging progressive members of Congress to take a stand against the \u201cpay-go\u201d rules.\n\nRep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a fellow incoming progressive and friend of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, has yet to announce her stance on the rules package, according to her spokesman.\n\nRep.-elect Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) announced Wednesday night that she would be voting for the rules package. Omar cited incoming Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern\u2019s (D-Mass.) assurance that \u201cpay-go\u201d would not be used to block progressive legislation and celebrated a successful December effort to prevent a supermajority requirement for tax hikes on all but the wealthiest taxpayers.\n\n\u201cBudgets are an expression of our values,\u201d Omar said in a statement. \u201cGoing forward, I support legislation to reform PAYGO and am committed to pursuing reforms that allow us to center our politics on people\u2019s everyday needs rather than artificial constraints.\u201d\n\nOmar also noted that the package includes House rules to accommodate religious headwear, enabling her to continue wearing a Muslim headscarf, or hijab, on the House floor.\n\nThe CPC co-chairs did not notify Ocasio-Cortez of their plans to accommodate Democratic leaders on pay-go, according to Corbin Trent, a spokesman for the incoming congresswoman. He confirmed that Ocasio-Cortez would be whipping votes against the rules package. If 18 Democrats defect, the package will fail.\n\n\u201cIf pay-go is going to be waived every step of the way \u2015 every time we need something big passed \u2015 then why do we need the thing in the first place?\u201d he asked.\n\nA House Democratic aide to a progressive member disputed Trent\u2019s version of events, saying that Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairs briefed all members on the rules and on their negotiating strategy with party leadership.\n\nAnd Democratic leaders are nonetheless confident that the rules package will pass, according to a Democratic House leadership aide.\n\nThe last-minute revolt against pay-go, however small, reflects a tidal shift in Democratic thinking about fiscal policy since the party last controlled the House.\n\nUnder the leadership of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Democrats reinstated expired pay-go rules requiring any new spending to be offset upon retaking the House in 2007. The party wanted to show that unlike then-President George W. Bush, who ran up annual budget deficits to finance the Iraq War and other priorities, Democrats were fiscally responsible.\n\nBut over the course of the following decade, many rank-and-file Democrats came to believe that trying to outflank Republicans from the right on fiscal policy was a suckers\u2019 game. Republicans would run up the debt to pay for tax cuts and mammoth defense spending \u2015 just as President Donald Trump has done. Democrats were left, as they saw it, to clean up the GOP\u2019s mess and to fit their budget for social programs into ever-more-austere limits.\n\nIn addition, an increasingly influential band of progressive economists led by figures like Paul Krugman during the Obama years \u2015 and more recently, Stephanie Kelton \u2015 have argued that debt only matters inasmuch as it has an impact on inflation.\n\nAnd against the predictions of many budget hawks, inflation has remained under 2 percent for years now."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Bernie Sanders Says He Was Unaware Of Harassment Claims In 2016 Campaign", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-sexual-harassment-response_us_5c2d6d11e4b05c88b7059d7e", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Sen.

Californians who are involuntarily committed to a mental institution twice in a year, or who are convicted of certain domestic violence offenses, could face a lifetime gun ownership ban.\n\nUnder an expanded Oregon law that went into effect on Jan. 1, domestic abuse offenders or people under restraining orders are banned from owning or purchasing a gun. In Illinois, authorities now have the right to seize firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others. A similar \u201cred flag\u201d law will go into effect in New Jersey later this year.\n\nAt least six states \u2014 California, Washington, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont \u2014 and the District of Columbia are raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of long guns this year, CNBC reported.\n\nWashington state will also be enforcing several other gun control measures, including enhanced background checks, secure gun storage laws and a requirement for gun purchasers to provide proof they\u2019ve undergone firearm safety training.\n\nNew \u2018Me Too\u2019 laws\n\nAP In 2018, the Me Too movement spurred many people to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment and abuse -- and prompted several states to pass new laws targeting sexual violence.\n\nSeveral states are taking aim at workplace sexual harassment. California has banned nondisclosure provisions in settlements involving claims of sexual assault, harassment or discrimination based on sex. California employers will also no longer be allowed to compel workers to sign nondisparagement agreements as a condition of employment or in exchange for a raise or bonus.\n\nBy the end of 2019, publicly held corporations in the Golden State will also need to have at least one woman on their board of directors. Depending on the size of the board, corporations will need to increase that number to at least two or three female board members by the end of 2021.\n\nIn New York, all employees will be required to complete annual sexual harassment prevention training. Larger businesses in Delaware will have to provide such training to their workers, and legislators and their staff in Virginia will need to undergo such training every year.\n\nMinimum wages get a boost\n\nThough the federal minimum wage has languished at $7.25 since 2009, at least 19 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, will be raising their minimum wages this year. Each will boost its minimum wage to at least $12. Some cities like New York, Seattle and Palo Alto, California, will see their wage floors increase to $15.\n\nSo long straws and stirrers!\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Under a new California law, restaurant customers will have to explicitly ask for a plastic straw if they want to use one.\n\nAs public awareness mounts of the hazards of plastic waste pollution, cities and states around the country have been targeting a major source of the problem: single-use plastic products like straws and food containers.\n\nA new law in New York City bars restaurants, stores and manufacturers from using most foam products, including takeout containers, cups and packing peanuts.\n\nEateries in the District of Columbia are now prohibited from giving out single-use plastic straws and stirrers. In California, restaurant patrons will need to ask explicitly for a plastic straw if they want to use one. Restaurants can be fined $25 a day for serving beverages with plastic straws that aren\u2019t requested by customers.\n\nFormer felons in Florida can head to the voting booth\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In November, Florida voted to approve a ballot measure that enabled more than 1 million former felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Florida will restore the voting rights of all former felons except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. Some 1.4 million possible voters will be added to the rolls \u2014 an addition that could have a significant effect on elections in the swing state.\n\nUtah implements strictest DUI law in the country\n\nUtah has lowered its blood alcohol content standard for drunk driving to 0.05 percent \u2014 the lowest limit in the country.\n\nUnder the new law, a driver who exceeds that limit and causes the death of another person will be charged with criminal homicide, a felony offense.\n\nAs CNN notes, all other U.S. states have a blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.08 percent for noncommercial drivers. Since at least 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board has been pushing to lower the limit to 0.05 nationwide.\n\nPets to get more rights in California\n\nPets in California will no longer be treated by courts as physical property in divorce cases. Instead, judges can decide who gets custody of the family pet.\n\nUnder a separate California law, pet stores will no longer be allowed to sell cats, dogs or rabbits that aren\u2019t from animal shelters or nonprofit rescue groups. That law, which took effect on Jan. 1, also requires that store owners maintain proper documentation of the backgrounds of the dogs, cats and rabbits they sell.\n\nHawaii legalizes physician-assisted suicide\n\nHawaii\u2019s new law allowing physician-assisted suicide took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTobacco targeted in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some states and cities are taking aim at tobacco products this year.\n\nSmoking will be banned at all New Jersey public beaches and parks starting in July.\n\nIn New York City, a new ordinance bans pharmacies from selling cigarettes and other tobacco products. And Massachusetts has raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.\n\nNonbinary people can list their gender as \u2018X\u2019 in NYC\n\nPeople who identify as neither male nor female can now list their gender as \u201cX\u201d on birth certificates in New York City.\n\nNew Jersey requires all residents to have health insurance\n\nA health insurance law in New Jersey that came into effect on Jan. 1 requires residents to maintain coverage or pay a penalty. It\u2019s the second state in the country, after Massachusetts, to enact an individual health insurance mandate.\n\nVermont is paying remote workers to move there\n\nIn an effort to promote economic growth, Vermont has offered to pay some remote workers to relocate to the state.\n\nQualified applicants can each apply for up to $10,000 in funding. The state has earmarked $500,000 for the initiative, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHunters in Illinois can wear pink if they want to\n\nNot into the usual \u201cblaze orange\u201d? Hunters in Illinois can now wear equally eye-catching \u201cblaze pink\u201d under a new law.\n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) said the new shade could be even more effective in helping hunters stand out.\n\n\u201c[In the fall] we\u2019re hunting in trees and in some fields, there are orange leaves. There is orange in the background, so it\u2019s not always easy to see orange,\u201d Rauner said, according to the Illinois News Network. \u201cSo we\u2019re adding blaze pink to be one of the colors.\u201d\n\nExpand your hunting wardrobe: blaze pink joins blaze orange as an official hunting color starting Jan. 1.

Disclosing these dealbreakers is often delightfully subtle and insignificant (e.g., I snore, I don\u2019t cook, I\u2019m sloppy and so on). It can also end a relationship \u2014 smoking, not wanting kids, infidelity ... so, what\u2019s my dating dealbreaker?\n\nI had a double mastectomy and don\u2019t have real boobs.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for just a second. I have a mutated BRCA1 gene, otherwise frightfully known as the \u201cbreast cancer gene.\u201d As its name suggests, having the mutation made my lifetime risk of getting breast cancer skyrocket up to 87 percent. That, and my family history of breast cancer put my depressing odds into clear context, and the logical plan of action was to simply slice my breasts off. This would reduce my risk of getting breast cancer to less than one percent ... so I had a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.\n\nIn July 2018, at 25 years old, I parted ways with my real boobs at a hospital in Kansas. Two additional surgeries later, and my body is beginning to heal \u2013 which has unfortunately allowed the emotional toll of this process to finally rear its ugly head.\n\nWhile nothing about this has been easy, I found myself immensely struggling in the dating realm after the surgery. I had just had my real breasts cut off, and it was really doing a number on my relationship-potential conviction. I failed to summon the confidence needed to swipe away on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. The single men in the real world were seemingly few and far between, and knowingly approaching them seemed unimaginable after my mastectomy.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones and a slight curve of the spine \u2014 a direct reflection of my self-assurance (or lack thereof).\n\nBut how could I feel confident when I was wholeheartedly embarrassed by the jagged, pink scars on my underboob? How could I take a man home with me when I was worried that the silicone implants would feel unpleasantly rock hard and artificial under his fingertips? How could I be intimate with a man when I felt anything but beautiful because of my new chest?\n\nI was afraid that a man would take one look at my bare breasts and find any excuse to avoid being intimate with me \u2014 so I remained single and resorted to my vibrator often.\n\nWhether I wanted to sleep with a man or not, the hesitancy and fear of being immediately rejected because of my mastectomy remained stronger than my desire to get laid or date someone. My sex life was certainly thrown a nasty and confusing curveball because of this fear, and I avoided getting into bed with anyone \u2014 unless I had a handful of vodka sodas coursing through me, of course. My liquid courage allowed me to be intimate with the lights on and my bra off. I may have been clumsy, but I was confident.\n\nIf the opportunity for sex presented itself and I was sober, the lights remained off, and my bra stayed on. More importantly, the contempt I had for my new body became impossible to ignore without being buzzed. It was also unrealistic to think that each time I did want to be intimate with a person and not loathe my aesthetic, I would need a drink or two \u2014 unless I towed a flask around in my cleavage or something.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples. There was a time where these two, pink protuberances played the most substantial part in my sex life \u2014 they were the key to my arousal. Now, I feel nothing at all. I knew before having the double mastectomy that I would lose sensation, but no one can prepare you for how heartbreaking this loss will actually be until a man\u2019s tongue is circling your areola and you don\u2019t feel a thing.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples.\n\nI felt broken, and I convinced myself that a man inside me would put me back together again \u2014 that some type of sexual approval would make me confident enough to be with another. Indulging in such an act was proof that I was not falling apart; that I didn\u2019t hate my body; that I was normal and everything was fine.\n\nI\u2019m fine, yet I still fantasized about having sex pre-double mastectomy.\n\nWhen I find myself dejected over the loss of my breasts and every other turmoil that comes along with having the BRCA1 mutation, I remind myself that it could always be worse. For starters, I never had breast cancer. I also have breasts, even if they are fake. Though my nipples may \u201cfeel\u201d nonexistent, they are there \u2014 and they are mine. So many women are not this lucky, and while there are days I could wrap myself in a blanket and my insecurities and sulk in my sadness, I know that I am ultimately a fortunate woman: a woman who deserves to get laid, regardless of my new perky (creepy) breasts.\n\nAfter my double mastectomy, I certainly haven\u2019t finalized a pickup line. I have yet to master the art of dating, and I\u2019m still incredibly awkward when it comes to telling a man about my surgery, but I am not ashamed, either. I took my health into my hands and am the sole decider if I get breast cancer \u2014 and now, I likely never will.\n\nAt the end of the day, my fake breasts are not dealbreakers. I\u2019m vegan, astonishingly loud, and detest country music \u2014 if you want to know my dealbreakers, those are likely them. But if a man were ever to judge me for my rock-hard, gravity defiant, cancer-free breasts? Then he isn\u2019t a man worth a second of my time."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Can't Stop All Election Interference", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-zuckerberg-election-interference_us_5c2c6452e4b0407e90861a14", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Wrapping up Facebook\u2019s worst year yet, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted that he has no fix for the hate speech and election interference plaguing his company.\n\nIn a celebratory New Year\u2019s post on the platform last week, the social media giant said his personal goals of 2018 had been focused on \u201cpreventing election interference, stopping the spread of hate speech and misinformation, making sure people have control of their information, and ensuring our services improve people\u2019s well-being,\u201d adding that progress had been made.\n\nRunning through a list of security advances and investments to safeguard the site \u2013 which has fallen under the scrutiny of the federal government as it threatens to regulate it \u2013 Zuckerberg revealed that he didn\u2019t have all the answers.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll catch every bad actor or piece of bad content, or that people won\u2019t find more examples of past mistakes before we improved our systems,\u201d he said in the statement, changing his tone after noting the positives. \u201cFor some of these issues, like election interference or harmful speech, the problems can never fully be solved.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was attempting to take some of the heat off his business while shedding light on the better parts of his year, but not everyone appreciated the message.\n\n\u201cNothing about selling our data without our consent I see,\u201d one irked user commented. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just too deeply ingrained in Facebook\u2019s \u2018DNA.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother demanded the site \u201cstop playing with users data.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll still make scads of money.\u201d\n\nLast April, Zuckerberg testified before Congress in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the political consulting firm harvested data from millions of users for political and marketing purposes.

Mike Morey, managing director of the communications firm engaged by the hospital, arranged for them to speak to reporters on the phone while he listened. The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.\n\nDefining an institution\u2019s role\n\nFounded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.\n\nIt now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E. Wittes, did not consult for companies, own their stock or serve on their boards, according to several people who worked for Dr. Varmus while he was at the hospital from 2000 to 2010. Dr. Varmus and Dr. Wittes declined to comment.\n\nBut some on the hospital\u2019s board wanted its chief executive to do more to encourage company-financed clinical trials and to bring discoveries to market. In an interview, John R. Gunn, the cancer center\u2019s chief operating officer from 1987 to 2015, said board members felt gems of research were \u201clying fallow and nobody was kind of pushing it, to commercialize it.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Treatment Gap: In Rehab, \u2018Two Warring Factions\u2019: Abstinence vs. Medication", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit \u2014 an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry\u2019s role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/facebook-suicide-screening-algorithm.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 09:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "A police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.\n\nEarlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case.

Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital \u2014 either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook\u2019s intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.)\n\nPolice stations from Massachusetts to Mumbai have received similar alerts from Facebook over the last 18 months as part of what is most likely the world\u2019s largest suicide threat screening and alert program.

It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union \u2014 as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site.

For older adults alone, this increased health care costs by 46 percent over a period of 10 years, compared with costs incurred by those without hearing loss, the authors reported in November in JAMA Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.\n\nOne of the authors, Jennifer A. Deal, an epidemiologist and gerontologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that while \u201chearing loss itself is not very expensive, the effect of hearing loss on everything else is expensive.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, people tend to wait much too long to get their hearing tested and treated with hearing aids, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to treat hearing loss, Dr. Lin told me.\n\nAge-related hearing loss comes on really slowly, making it harder for people to know when to take it seriously, he said. He cited two good clues to when to get your hearing tested: Family members or close friends say you should, or you notice that you often mishear or don\u2019t know what others are saying.\n\nBut even when people are tested and spend thousands of dollars to purchase needed hearing aids, the devices often sit in a drawer. People may complain that the sound quality is poor, too static-y or otherwise annoying, and that the aids merely amplify all sound, making it still hard to hear in a noisy environment. All aids are not created equal, Dr. Lin said, and even expensive, properly fitted aids can require multiple adjustments. Some people give up too readily to get the best results.\n\n\u201cUnrealistic expectations are a big part of this problem,\u201d Dr. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like putting on a pair of glasses that immediately enables you to see clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing loss is not fixed as easily as eyesight. The brain needs time \u2014 a good month or two \u2014 to adjust to hearing aids. And the earlier hearing loss is treated, the easier it is for the brain to adapt.\u201d\n\nThe new studies give ample cause for taking hearing loss seriously. Consider, for example, the link to dementia. People who can\u2019t hear well often become socially isolated and deprived of stimuli that keep the brain cognitively engaged. As input lessens, so does brain function."}]
