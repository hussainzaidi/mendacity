She was forced to postpone a parliamentary vote on the deal on Monday when it became clear she would suffer a humiliating loss that could have finished her premiership.\n\nSpeaking after her meeting with Merkel, May appeared to acknowledge there was no chance of reopening negotiations on the Irish backstop, the part of the deal designed to avoid the return of border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nEmbattled British Prime Minister Theresa May launched a tour of European capitals in a desperate bid to salvage her Brexit deal.\n\n\"The backstop is a necessary guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland,\" May said, adding that whatever relationship the UK wants with Europe \"there will be a backstop in it.\"\n\nMay said she wanted to seek assurances from European leaders that the backstop would be a last resort, and if it were to be invoked, it would be temporary.\n\nEarlier, May met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at The Hague before flying to Berlin to meet with Merkel and then again to Brussels to see European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nMay also spoke with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz over the phone. A statement from a spokesperson from the Austrian chancellery said Kurz was in favor \"of considering to what extent the British side could be given more security without unraveling the withdrawal agreement.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"It is clear that the EU continues to stand by Ireland's side and supports an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, especially as it is concerned with the preservation of the Good Friday Agreement (the Northern Ireland peace agreement).\"\n\nAfterward, May met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

He added that \"the best deal we have achieved is the best deal and the only deal possible.\"\n\nAs she flitted around Europe, rumors swirled at Westminster that members of May's Conservative Party were close to triggering a vote of no-confidence in her leadership.

Then, after a weekend of speculation, she delayed the vote.\n\nOne of the most common questions that European politicos are asked by people with better things to do is \"what will actually happen with Brexit?\" For the last couple of years, it's been possible to conjure up half answers that sound a bit clever and move on. But the awful truth, even this late in the game, is that no one knows -- even the people in charge.\n\nThis partly stems from the current reality of British politics. No one, it seems, has a workable plan that can be credibly presented as something that might, you know, feasibly happen.\n\nMay and her inner circle have failed to convince the UK's Parliament that her deal really is the best -- and only -- thing on the table.\n\nAs a result, the Prime Minister pulled the so-called meaningful vote on her Brexit deal, presumably for fear of a heavy defeat and the chain of events that could follow.\n\nShe will now spend the rest of her week darting between European capitals to plead with fellow EU leaders before nipping back to London to face the House of Commons again on Wednesday before heading back to Brussels in the hope that she get secure sufficient assurances on her deal and sway MPs to vote for it. Never let it be said that the Prime Minister is not an optimist...\n\nOne of the many problems she faces is that even her own Conservative Party hates the deal, in large part because of something called the Irish border backstop.\n\nJUST WATCHED British peer: Brexit chaos 'going to get worse' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH British peer: Brexit chaos 'going to get worse' 14:27\n\nThe border between the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) and Northern Ireland (part of the UK) has been the thorniest issue of the whole Brexit process. For historical reasons, both negotiating teams have from day one said that avoiding a hard border was an absolute priority.\n\nUnfortunately, for boring reasons to do with trade and customs, that is likely impossible unless Northern Ireland is in some kind of Customs Union with the EU, which means the whole UK if you don't want to break up the Union.\n\nConservatives loathe this, as they have long hailed the ability to independently trade with countries around the world as the prize for Brexit (see why that is a fantasy here ).\n\nThen there's the opposition Labour Party and its fudgy Brexit policy. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seemed to as good as admit on Monday that he accepted the negotiations were closed and that the EU would not budge on the border. He also implied that May should stand aside and allow a leader (presumably one J. Corbyn) capable of negotiating a better deal to take over. It doesn't take a genius to work out the problem here.\n\nLabour's other problem is that it is almost as divided as the Conservative Party on Brexit -- especially on the matter of a second referendum, or the People's Vote, as it's known. Corbyn and his top team seem reluctant to endorse this outright. They certainly don't want to be seen as supporting any efforts to prevent Brexit -- something many in Westminster believe to be the ultimate intention of the People's Vote.\n\nThe People's Vote is backed by people across the political spectrum. And its supporters have extra pep in their step after the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could hypothetically revoke Article 50, should it want to and with a mountain of caveats.\n\nBut with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit, it's not exactly clear how such a vote could even be carried out, which of the two main parties would back what side, how it would be funded, what the question would be, how many answers there would be and what government would legislate for it.\n\nMeanwhile, back on planet Earth, the EU has said repeatedly that negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement are not going to be reopened; it is likely not possible to have a second referendum before Brexit Day (ergo, the UK would very much not unilaterally have to ask the EU to extend Article 50); there is no guarantee that the Norway option is something the EU even wants (why would it want the second largest EEA economy unbeholden to EU law?); and, whisper it, but both frontbenches support Brexit and would likely have to were there a second referendum.\n\nSo how's that for clarity? For some unknown reason, politicians of all factions and levels of seniority have had their ill-considered whims indulged for over two years now. Rather than be forcibly whipped in line and made to confront reality, the UK's all-consuming political vacuum has created a safe space for a sort of fantasy land.\n\nMeanwhile, with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit day, the world still has no clarity on what's about to become of its fifth largest economy.\n\nIt might be funny if it wasn't so terrifying.\n\nThis article has been updated to correct the number of weeks until Brexit."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Parliament member kicked out for grabbing mace", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GrBizma3Tcw/brexit-labour-party-parliament-member-grabs-mace-protest-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "The House of Commons expelled a Labour Party MP after he picked up the ceremonial mace in protest against the postponement of a vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Why there is no easy path in the Brexit deal", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/lVbZhiy8SF0/uk-brexit-deal-options-theresa-may-richard-quest-lkl-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's Richard Quest takes a look at the different Brexit deal options facing the UK government, after Prime Minister Theresa May pulled the plug on a parliamentary vote."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi and journalists named Time Person of the Year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/upaFsoAAIeo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) Time magazine has chosen \"The Guardians,\" a group of journalists who have been targeted for their work, as Person of the Year.\n\nA series of four black-and-white covers highlights what the magazine calls \"the War on Truth.\"\n\nThe group includes Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post contributor who was killed at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October.

The top five warmest years have all occurred since 2014.\n\nTemperatures in the Arctic are warming more than twice as fast as the overall planet's average temperature, with temperatures this year in the highest latitudes (above 60 degrees north) coming in 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1981-2010 average. These were the second warmest (behind 2016) air temperatures ever recorded during the Arctic year, which runs from October through September to avoid splitting the winter season.\n\nThe five years since 2014 have been warmer than any other years in the historical record, which goes back to 1900. Although Arctic temperatures have been subject to wild swings back and forth through the decades due to natural variability, they have been consistently warmer than average since 2000 and at or near record since 2014, the report states.\n\n\"The changes we are witnessing in the Arctic are sufficiently rapid that they cannot be explained without considering our impacts on the chemistry of the atmosphere,\" Thomas Mote, a research scientist at the University of Georgia who authored part of the report, told CNN in an email.\n\nMote expressed than any natural cycle or mechanism that would lead to the amount of warming and ice loss that has been observed would take much longer than the few years over which we have seen these drastic changes.\n\nA vicious cycle\n\nSince 2000, Arctic temperatures, shown in red, have been higher than the overall global temperature anomalies, shown in gray. In 2018 the Arctic was shown to be warming at an alarming rate, twice as fast as the average global temperature.\n\nThe rapid warming of the Arctic is known as \"Arctic amplification,\" which is due to multiple feedback loops that the report describes. Warmer temperatures lead to less ice and snow, which means less sunlight is reflected and more is absorbed by the darker oceans. This warms the ocean further, which in turn decreases the sea ice even more. The lack of sea ice and more ocean surface leads to additional cloudiness later in the fall season, which keeps the Arctic region warmer even later into the winter.\n\n\"What starts in the Arctic isn't confined there,\" Mote noted. \"Changes in sea ice influence ocean currents and the jet stream in ways that can affect weather in lower latitudes, including the United States and Europe,\" Mote said.\n\nThe report highlighted several of these events over the past year as an example of how Arctic warming can influence day-to-day weather.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Bomb Cyclone' rips through East Coast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Bomb Cyclone' rips through East Coast 01:07\n\nSea ice continues to decline\n\nAs you would expect with the trend of record warm temperatures, sea ice has seen dramatic declines over the past 20 years as well, with 2018 continuing that trend.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Arctic Report Card, this year featured the second-lowest winter sea-ice extent -- the amount of the Arctic Ocean that is covered with sea ice -- since the satellite record began in 1979. The summer minimum sea ice was the sixth-lowest over the same time period.\n\nWhile winter sea ice extents have decreased at a much slower rate compared to the ice extent during the summer, there has been a significant change to the ice pack during the winter.\n\nOld ice -- ice that lasts through four or more melt seasons -- seen in 1985, left, and 2018, right.\n\nThe ice is much younger than it used to be . According to the report, fewer than 1% of Arctic ice is considered \"oldest ice,\" meaning it is at least four years old and has survived multiple melt seasons. Older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient to changes in temperature.\n\nSince scientists began measuring the age of the ice in the mid-1980s, multi-year ice in the Arctic has decreased in size from 2.54 million square kilometers (roughly the size of Mexico and all of Central America combined) to 0.13 million square kilometers (roughly the size of Nicaragua in Central America) -- a 95% reduction in a little over 30 years.\n\n\"Sea ice cover has transformed from a strong, thick pack in the 1980s to a more fragile, younger, thinner, and more mobile pack in recent years,\" the report states, where \"the thinner, younger ice is more vulnerable to melting out in the summer and has contributed to the decreasing trend in the minimum ice extent.\"\n\nRed tides and reindeer\n\nThe warming of the Arctic climate and the decline of sea ice have led to some drastic changes in the biodiversity of the region.\n\nThe report's authors found notable increases in harmful algal blooms, often known as red tides, which can affect human, wildlife and ecosystem health and lead to mass die-offs of fish and marine mammals, such as was observed in Florida during much of the summer this year.\n\nAs the Arctic warms, new toxins are being introduced to the region. This map highlights the location and kind of toxins found in marine animal species from 2004 to 2013 in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nWhile normally confined to warmer climates, the toxin-producing phytoplankton have been shifting northward as ocean temperatures rise, posing a risk to the local populations and economies that depend heavily on fishing for food and tourism.\n\nOther native wildlife species are feeling the heat, as well. Reindeer and caribou populations continued to decline in 2018, according to the report, with their total populations dropping by more than 50% over the past 20 years.\n\nWhile climate change isn't the only factor likely behind the decline in these herds, it is a driving force for a number of threats the animals face. Increased heat stress, food shortages, disease and parasites -- climate change overarches each of these challenges, the report states."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Climbers' bodies found 30 years after disappearance", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/GrjU_5EXjAQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Scottish mountaineer who spent weeks searching for two friends who disappeared in the Himalayas more than 30 years ago has spoken of his relief after their remains were finally found.\n\nThe bodies of Icelanders Kristinn Runarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson were discovered at the bottom of a glacier by an American climber last month, according to a report from the Church of Scotland.\n\nClimber Steve Aisthorpe, a Church official, was with the two men during an October 1988 expedition to climb Pumori, a challenging 7,161 meter (23,494 foot) mountain near Everest, and said the discovery had united those who knew the pair and had brought closure.\n\n\"The discovery of the remains of Thorsteinn and Kristinn after so many years has inevitably brought many emotions to the surface for all who knew and loved these wonderful guys,\" he said.\n\n\"But it has also brought people together and, I pray, will help with greater closure and, in time, peace.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "An untold reason for the migrant caravan", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/oOg_ZqYhxqo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Cop\u00e1n, Honduras (CNN) Each night after her husband left, Delmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez walked to a neighbor's house to look for him on the TV news. He had fled their mountaintop community here in rural Honduras without a phone because no one in the family could afford one. Their floor was made of dirt, they grew their own food. Watching coverage of the migrant caravan heading for the United States was Hern\u00e1ndez's only way to know if he was alive.\n\nWhat she saw in the broadcasts were visions from hell. Families jumping from bridges, getting kidnapped along dusty roads, dodging tear gas cannons fired by police from richer nations. How could this be? She continued scanning, hoping to find him, hoping not to.\n\nShe had begged Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez not to go, but her 30-year-old husband had his reasons. The town's corn and bean crops had failed during a years-long drought. There was no work aside from farming. No money for irrigation. Their four children, ages 3 to 13, had little to eat.\n\nRam\u00edrez told his wife that he had no choice but to leave with the \"caravan\" of thousands that had formed in Honduras and would make its way north. This was their chance, she recalled him saying that day. He could go with the group, find work, send back money.\n\nIt was this or risk starvation.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez with her four children.\n\nThe couple's tragic story, as well as others I heard on a recent four-day trip to western Honduras, complicates two narratives being told about the migrant caravan.\n\nTo hear President Trump tell it, Central American \"Gang Members and some very bad people\" are attempting to storm the United States at its southern border. \"This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you,\" the President wrote on Twitter. American news reports, meanwhile, largely have focused on high rates of violent crime in Honduras and El Salvador that have driven families to seek asylum as refugees in the United States.\n\nOverlooked is this factor: climate change.\n\nThe \"dry corridor\" of Central America, which includes parts of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, has been hit with an unusual drought for the last five years. Crops are failing. Starvation is lurking. More than two million people in the region are at risk for hunger, according to an August report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, without any change in rain patterns, people are already struggling,\" said Edwin Castellanos, dean of research at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and a global authority on climate change in Central America. \"In some of these dry areas, we have seen events of children actually dying out of hunger. So, it is that extreme.\"\n\nThis drought has been longer and more intense than those seen before in the dry corridor, Castellanos said. The failure of critical springtime rains is also new, he said, and is causing such problems for farmers whose crops depend on that water.\n\nSubsistence crops like corn and beans are all but dying. Our crew saw beans the size of Tic Tacs. And shriveled, partially blackened ears of corn could fit inside your palm.\n\nCorn crops have been smaller than usual, leading to a hunger crisis.\n\nKevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said in a speech on Friday that drought and crop failures in Honduras and Guatemala \"directly translate into who's arriving at our border.\"\n\nStudies have not definitively tied this particular drought to climate change, but computer models show droughts like the one happening now are becoming more common as the world warms.\n\nThousands have risked their lives to flee these circumstances.\n\nAnd previously unpublished data shows people started leaving certain areas of Honduras amid crop failures -- even as homicide rates were declining.\n\nTake Cop\u00e1n, the region of Honduras that Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez fled in October.\n\nIn fiscal year 2012, around the start of the drought, only about 20 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by the US Border Patrol while trying to cross the US-Mexico border, according to a data analysis of records shared with CNN by Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at The University of Texas at Austin. Then drought hit, its cumulative effects growing as the years wore on. In 2017, about 1,450 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by US authorities at the border, the data show. In fiscal year 2018, with the data ending in September, the number of migrants picked up was more than 2,500.\n\nThose figures are \"absolutely\" an underestimation, said Leutert. \"You're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to big cities, you're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to another place in the region, you're missing people who tried to go to the United States and didn't make it -- and you're missing people who went to the United States and crossed undetected.\"\n\nThe figure is a \"baseline\" that shows something big is happening, she said.\n\nAny person's decision to abandon their homeland is complex. For some, violence is part of it. As is extreme poverty. In Central America, it's often a combination of things.\n\nBut there's another truth: This region is becoming less hospitable to farmers as more-industrialized countries burn loads of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. A December report shows the world is on track to create 37.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2018 -- yet another record. This pollution traps heat and warms the planet, making cyclical weather events like droughts, floods and certain storms worse.\n\nThe United States, which is the destination for so many migrants fleeing Honduras, bears outsize responsibility for global warming. Cumulatively, the nation has done more to cause climate change since the Industrial Revolution than any other. Today, President Trump supports increased coal production and has pledged to abandon the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. A \"rulebook\" for that agreement is being debated this week at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, with the United States on the sidelines.\n\nNotably, Trump also has also made immigration his signature issues, rallying supporters around the idea of stopping people from Latin America, like Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, from crossing illegally into the United States. There's broad support for a crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States among Republican voters. A quarter of US midterm voters said that immigration was their No. 1 issue, and 75% of those voters were Republicans, according to a November exit poll. \"Build that wall\" has become a popular chant at Trump political rallies.\n\nFederal authorities have met would-be migrants at the border near San Diego with tear gas. Officials say the tear-gassing occurred after migrants threw rocks at authorities.\n\nYet there's an unspoken irony here.\n\nThe nation that's become a destination for so many migrants -- a beacon of opportunity and hope --is contributing to the conditions forcing some people to abandon home.\n\n'I was waiting for you like the rains in May'\n\nThink of Central America like an island.\n\nThat's advice from Castellanos, the climate scientist in Guatemala.\n\nHe's not talking about just any old island. He's referencing the specks of land in the Pacific -- Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands -- whose very existence is threatened by rising sea levels that are linked to global warming. I visited the Marshall Islands in 2015 after readers of CNN's \"Two Degrees\" series voted for me to do a story on \"climate refugees.\" Higher tides and increased flooding were already pushing people out -- and to Arkansas, of all places.\n\nCrops have been failing in the \"dry corridor\" of Central America.\n\nThese little islands gained a huge voice at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December of that year -- the predecessor to the talks happening now in Poland. Calling themselves the \"High Ambition Coalition,\" island diplomats rallied with richer nations to make a moral case for climate action -- saying their sovereign territory would vanish if global temperatures were allowed to warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. That goal became embedded in the Paris Agreement. In order to achieve it, global carbon emissions would need to be cut in half in about a decade.\n\nThe climate problem in Central America isn't so much sea-level rise. But Castellanos told me an argument can be made that the region is nearly as susceptible to global warming. It is a slim stretch of land connecting North and South America -- a string of land between continents. That makes it vulnerable to storms coming from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Climate change is supercharging those. Plus, climate models show both floods and droughts getting more intense. The United Nations Development Programme considers Honduras to be \"highly vulnerable\" to climate change, both now and in the future as the atmosphere continues to warm.\n\nThe dry corridor gets that name because it's long been dry, situated behind a mountain range that catches weather from the Caribbean. But the recent drought there has challenged notions about how bad a drought in Central America could be, Castellanos told me. Some areas have seen 10 consecutive months without rain.\n\nCentral Americans have an expression -- \"I was waiting for you like the rains in May.\" It references the fact that massive rains fall in May and June, like clockwork each year. Farmers plant their crops accordingly, counting on the spring rains to soak the plants and ensure a productive harvest. Many people here are subsistence farmers and can't afford irrigation systems. They're completely at the mercy of rains, and those rains aren't coming.\n\nWhen they do come, they come all at once -- causing floods and damage.\n\n\"Here, unlike in the United States, we don't have a problem of convincing people\" that climate change is real, Castellanos told me. \"People are convinced by what they see.\"\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, the farmer on the hilltop in Cop\u00e1n, lived through this. Then he heard the caravan was passing near his village. People believed that traveling together would provide safety. From Honduras to Guatemala to Mexico, the number would grow into the thousands.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ramirez left with the migrant \"caravan\" in October.\n\nIn mid-October, Ram\u00edrez fled Cop\u00e1n on foot, hoping to catch the caravan. He carried a small backpack with a few items of clothing, his wife said. In his pocket was a paper with a neighbor's telephone number on it.\n\nThat phone would ring in the village some time later.\n\nIt would not be Ram\u00edrez's voice on the phone.\n\nAnd the news would not be good.\n\n'We are losing most of the crops'\n\nI came to meet the people left behind.\n\nThe location: several communities in the Cop\u00e1n Department of Honduras, near the Guatemala border. I'd chosen the place because of the data CNN analyzed with Stephanie Leutert, from the University of Texas.\n\nThe data, which tracks families apprehended at the US-Mexico border, does not prove on its own that people are fleeing Cop\u00e1n because of climate change. But the figures do support the idea that people newly started fleeing during that timeframe.\n\nThe first point is that the exodus from Cop\u00e1n has grown faster than in the rest of Honduras. In 2012, only 3.7% of Honduran migrants came from that area. By 2018, up to September, it was more than 9%.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of murders per year in Cop\u00e1n has been declining.\n\nAgain, this provides only a rough sketch of what's happening, Leutert said, but it is clear that climate change is one factor driving people from the region. \"Climate change is reducing (crop) yields,\" she said. \"It's like a tax. It's making things harder for people and industries that rely on weather stability. Sometimes climate change can push people over the edge and make it impossible (to survive). We see that with the coffee industry. That last added cost is making the business model unsustainable -- and pushing people to migrate.\"\n\nCop\u00e1n is a mountainous place of dense forest and sweeping valleys. In the morning, mist rises from the hills like steam, making it look like molten ripples of land have just cooled. By afternoon, clouds hang on the hilltops, threatening to rain but rarely cracking. Dried-up corn stalks, which look almost unrecognizable if you're used to the engineered, Midwestern variety, dart around at odd angles between rocks and patches of dirt, clinging to steep hillsides. The more fertile land is the valleys, where most crops grow. Even during the worst of the drought, some vegetation here is green and appears almost lush. But Castellanos and others told me it's the timing and amount of rain that's critical. And many months here are now totally dry.\n\nWhat was it like to live in this place?\n\nAnd how and when did people feel it was impossible to stay?\n\nThe resident of this house in Copan, Honduras, emigrated. The area has seen its homicide rate go down while emigration to the US rises.\n\nOur team drove south past a town that was abandoned by the Mayan people thousands of years ago and now is known for the remaining artifacts. Our tires kicked up dust from the path, coating every roadside fern in a film of beige.\n\nAt a construction site, Evelio Ochoa, 35, was pouring cement into the land -- helping build the foundation of a home for his niece. He's doing any odd job he can find these days. Years ago, he told me, he paid a coyote -- a smuggler -- to help him leave Honduras. His small plot of corn and bean crops had failed, he said. The coyote's price: 60,000 Lempiras, or about $2,500. He got the money from a relative, he said.\n\nThat price bought him three attempts to reach the United States.\n\nHe made the first attempt in 2014, he told me, amid record drought.\n\nThe second was earlier this year.\n\nBoth times he was deported, he said.\n\nIf he failed a third time, there would be no money to try again.\n\n\"You don't fear for yourself, you fear for your family,\" Ochoa said of setting out on the journey. \"The moment you step out of the house and start walking it's difficult -- not because of the danger but because you miss your family\" and are thinking about their safety.\n\nIn September, Ochoa said, authorities caught him a third time.\n\nHe finds himself back in Honduras, struggling to feed his family.\n\nEvelio Ochoa said he fled to the United States three times unsuccessfully.\n\nOchoa's wife, Nora Vazques, said she and their five children would have starved if a relative hadn't been sending money from the United States. The 33-year-old mother, whose children are ages 1 to 12, showed me a basket of unusable black corn kernels, picked from a rotten crop.\n\n\"Before, the rain was much better,\" she said standing in the shadow of her doorway, the midday light half-illuminating her face. Her hand shook as she wiped away tears.\n\n\"He grew a lot of corn\" back then, she said. \"Now we are losing most of the crops.\"\n\n'This is an injustice'\n\nLisandro Mauricio Arias is mayor of the town the Mayans abandoned.\n\nWe met at the town square, which is surrounded by tile roofs and palm trees. Cop\u00e1n Ruinas is a tourist destination that boasts several quaint hotels, but the town has seen better times. For that reason, I figured Arias might downplay the outmigration that data shows is occurring here -- that he might have an incentive to say the drought hasn't been so bad.\n\nHe didn't do that.\n\nThe town is emptying out, he told me.\n\nHow many people have left?\n\nHis guess: 30%.\n\nHe regrets that, but says it may be the only way.\n\n\"When analyzing precipitation levels, we can see they have changed a lot -- which is really alarming,\" he said. \"Problems associated with drought will get worse.\"\n\n\"We respect the decisions the United States is making,\" he added. \"It's their country, and they have the right to defend it. However, I believe they need to take into consideration the human factor -- what is humanity? These people are not trying to meddle. [They are] looking for an opportunity to survive.\"\n\nAmong those people are the sons of Mariano and Gregoria Perez.\n\nThe two young men, ages 19 and 26, are stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, according to their family in Honduras. Their parents have only been able to speak with them two or three times, they said, because phone credit is so expensive. (I was unable to reach them.)\n\nTwo of Gregoria Perez's sons left Honduras in the migrant \"caravan.\"\n\nWhat the men's parents know are only the barest of details. One son was mugged and lost all of his belongings, including his passport, according to Mariano Perez, 55. Gregoria said she told the boys they could come back home. Secretly, though, the family worries. The young men have crossed international borders illegally already. Could they come back?\n\n\"I would say that this is an injustice because they did not do anything wrong,\" said Gregoria Perez, who, like her husband, said the boys left because farming wasn't viable amid the drought, and there were no other options. \"They want to find work to sustain themselves.\"\n\nI sat down outside to talk with her husband as the sun was setting. He sat on a small wooden stool and I was on the ground. The angle and time of night rendered his face in silhouette.\n\nMariano Perez told me his sons heard about the caravan on TV and left the same day. The father was down the hill helping a neighbor build a fence. He didn't know they'd left until he returned home that night. He doesn't fault them for it. He knew why they left, of course: drought.\n\nWhat bothers him is where they are now.\n\nHe worries they're hungry in Tijuana, as they were here.\n\nHe worries they may not make it across the border.\n\nSometimes, in his darker moments, he wonders if this is what God predicted in the book of Revelations -- the end of the world, happening slowly and before his eyes.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to find my news feed full of images of tent camps in Tijuana.\n\nIt had started raining on the migrants.\n\n\"I feel like a street dog,\" one man told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"Wet and cold and with no place to go.\"\n\nCorn crops, shown here, and beans are among the staple foods in the area.\n\n'Migration with dignity'\n\nI didn't say this to the lonesome father, but it's the reality: His sons have very little chance of settling lawfully in the United States if they are able to cross the border.\n\nThat's because there's no legal status for \"climate refugees.\"\n\nThe rules that govern the rights of refugees were developed in the aftermath of World War II and during the early Cold War, when western countries like the United States had an interest in protecting people who were persecuted in the communist Soviet Union, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier write in \"Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy for a Changing World.\"\n\nOnly a few specific groups were protected -- those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or social group. The 1951 UN refugee convention says people meeting those criteria should be able to seek asylum outside their home states.\n\nOther types of migration -- including people seeking economic opportunity or those fleeing climate change -- are not protected in a similarly codified way.\n\nThose people are typically not \"refugees\" in the legal sense.\n\nThey're migrants. And if they cross borders, they may break national laws.\n\nNot everyone believes that should be so.\n\nAnote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, one of the small island nations in the Pacific, has advocated for what he calls \"migration with dignity\" -- the opportunity for people from climate-affected areas to relocate if that makes their lives safer or gets them out of danger.\n\n\"There's no harm in being prepared,\" he told me in an interview this fall.\n\nCoffee producers are major employers in the region, and also have struggled.\n\nThat idea runs against the current of nationalism sweeping the globe. From the United States to Hungary, Australia to Denmark, countries have been fortifying walls, filling detention centers and even detaining asylum seekers on castaway islands -- not welcoming them. The United States is accepting far fewer refugees than it has in most years in recent memory.\n\nAttempting to add a \"climate refugee\" category in international law could pose problems of its own. Among them: How do you define who is and is not a climate refugee? Scientists are getting better at finding human fingerprints on heatwaves, droughts and storms that are being supercharged by global warming. But this is a realm of probabilities and complexities. It's difficult to say, with certainty, \"climate change made me move.\" Then there are political concerns, as well. Some scholars argue it's politically dangerous to try to amend international refugee conventions because this is such an anti-refugee moment in history. The process could lead to refugee rights being stripped instead of added. Others contend that the UN refugee convention is so rarely followed that it's almost irrelevant anyway, especially after the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe.\n\n\"If you were to create this whole new category and give people grounds to apply for asylum based on climate, you're likely to get an enormous number of people applying because it's so ill-defined,\" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \"How much below-average rainfall does the rainfall have to be in your region before you're a climate refugee? At present, the primary receiving countries already are experiencing tremendous resistance to the current level of asylees and refugees. It doesn't seem like resettling people in developed counties is going to be much of an answer to this problem. ... A much more effective use of resources is always to help people in place.\"\n\nIt's also unclear that climate change is the main reason people are fleeing Central America, he said; the \"pull factors\" of wealth and opportunity in the United States may be more important.\n\n\"You can think of climate change as one of the push factors,\" he said, \"but it isn't the reason we get the caravan, per se. And it's also important to understand if people were just starving, and they were desperately fleeing the total breakdown of the food chain, why travel 1,500 miles across Mexico to the US border? Mexico has lots of places you could stop to get basic sustenance.\"\n\nA 2018 report from the World Bank proposes two additional solutions.\n\nFirst, cut carbon emissions, which is the aim of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSecond, help would-be migrants adapt to the warmer world. The international Green Climate Fund, which President Trump promised to walk away from, too, has approved projects to help farmers in Central America to become more productive, blunting the force of drought. USAID also has supported irrigation and farming projects in the region, according to a federal official.\n\nDon't let the greenery fool you, scientists say. Western Honduras has been hit with a crop-damaging drought in recent years.\n\nCombined, those two tools could reduce forced, internal displacement from climate change by about 80%, according to the World Bank's \"Groundswell\" report on climate migration.\n\nBarring substantial changes, however, the scope of the migration crisis could be enormous.\n\nAn estimated 17 million people in Latin America could be forced to relocate within their countries because of climate change by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, according to the World Bank report. Across three regions that the World Bank examined -- which also included sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia -- more than 143 million people could be forced to relocate because of global warming.\n\nThat figure doesn't include extreme weather, such as hurricanes, which also are getting worse and tend to get more attention from the news media. The report only looks at slow onset climate disasters, from sea level rise to crop failures and water stress.\n\nIn other words -- events like the drought in Central America.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\n\nThe phone rang in the hilltop community.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez's husband, Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, had left several days before, looking for the caravan, carrying with him a phone number in his pocket in case he could find a way to call the village.\n\nShe'd been worried sick the entire time, scanning for his face on TV.\n\nThe voice did not bring relief.\n\nHer husband was missing, the person said.\n\nLater, she would learn the worst had happened.\n\nRam\u00edrez died on the road in Guatemala.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez buried her husband in the earth he used to till.\n\nThe precise circumstances are unclear to her. Perhaps he was hit by a car while walking along the highway. Perhaps he was hitching a ride in a car that crashed. These are the stories people have relayed. What she knows for sure is that he died October 20 near Guatemala City.\n\nCause of death: severe trauma.\n\nAuthorities were able to bring his body back to the village; she is thankful for that. She buried him on the slope of a mountain above the town, in the same earth he used to till.\n\nShe doesn't know what exactly will become of her family now.\n\nShe hasn't been farming, hasn't been able to.\n\nThe nonprofit World Vision has had to help with food.\n\nBut when she looks at her youngest child, she finds hope.\n\nHe is 3 years old -- and named Germ\u00e1n, like his father, and grandfather, too.\n\nWill he farm this same land? I asked her.\n\nYes, she told me.\n\n\"I imagine he will be just like his dad.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "How Huawei's CFO ended up in a jail in Canada", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/5E8LR87reR0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) For months, American law enforcement officials wanted to arrest Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei, but she remained outside of their grasp.\n\nThen in late November, with just two days' notice, they spotted an opening.\n\nOn the morning of December 1, Meng was set to transfer from a Cathay Pacific flight at Vancouver International Airport. During her 12-hour layover there, she could be detained by Canadian police, giving US prosecutors the chance to seek her extradition.\n\n\"Unless Meng is provisionally arrested in Canada ... while in transit, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ensure her presence in the United States for prosecution,\" the US request to Canada for Meng's arrest said.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was taken into custody on December 1 \u2014 the same day that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping dined on steak in Buenos Aires and agreed to a truce in their trade war.\n\nThe detention of Meng, one of China's top tech executives, emerged days later. It has fueled doubts about whether the trade ceasefire will hold and added an unpredictable new element to the rocky relationship between the world's top two economies.\n\nThe United States has not shared details of its case against Meng and its efforts to get her to stand trial over allegations she helped Huawei dodge US sanctions on Iran. The US Justice Department has repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nBut a trove of documents filed in Canadian court and reviewed by CNN Business provides a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes moves that led to Meng's arrest. And it indicates how the case could proceed if the high-profile executive is brought to a courtroom in New York.\n\nMeng's alleged crimes\n\nMeng, who also serves as deputy chairperson of Huawei's board, faces \"serious charges of fraud involving millions of dollars\" in the United States, according to the affidavit of a Canadian law enforcement official. She could receive substantial jail time if convicted, the statement said.\n\nHer arrest was set in motion in August, when a US federal judge signed off on a warrant for her arrest.\n\nThe United States accuses Meng, 46, of helping Huawei, one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment, get around sanctions on Iran. She's said to have told financial institutions that affiliate Skycom was a separate company in order to conduct business in the country, when in fact it was a subsidiary.\n\n\"Meng and other Huawei employees repeatedly lied about the nature of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom and the fact that Skycom operated as Huawei's Iran-based affiliate in order to continue to obtain banking services,\" the United States said in the arrest request it delivered to Canadian authorities.\n\na series of Reuters articles US officials went on to say that many of the deceptive statements followeda series of Reuters articles detailing Huawei's control of Skycom . The news agency reported that Skycom tried to illegally import US-made computer equipment into Iran.\n\nMeng is said to have made multiple false claims at a meeting with one of Huawei's banks in 2013. Though it's not named in court documents, Meng's lawyer said Friday the bank was HSBC ( HSBC ).\n\nThe United States claims that during the meeting, Meng used an English interpreter and walked through a PowerPoint presentation in Chinese that \"included numerous untrue or misleading representations regarding Huawei's ownership and control of Skycom.\"\n\nMeng said that Huawei's relationship with Skycom consisted of \"normal business cooperation,\" according to a translation of the presentation.\n\nHSBC is said to have cleared more than $100 million in Skycom transactions that traveled through the United States between 2010 and 2014.\n\nStuart Levey, chief legal officer of HSBC, said in a statement on Monday that the US Justice Department has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation.\n\nThe Alouette Correctional Centre for Women, where Meng Wanzhou was being held east of Vancouver.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Standard Chartered ( SCBFF ) bank was also duped by Huawei . Standard Chartered spokeswoman Julie Gibson said Monday that the bank is \"unable to comment on client relationships or communications.\"\n\nMeng's attorney said in court that there's no evidence she had personal knowledge of the facts presented in the presentation, which was prepared by others.\n\nHuawei has said it's \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng\" and that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.\"\n\nFour children and two houses in Vancouver\n\nCourt documents also revealed more information about Meng herself.\n\nThe daughter of Huawei's elusive founder, Ren Zhengfei, Meng said she first started work at her father's company in 1993, according to the personal statement she submitted.\n\nShe married Xiaozong Liu, a venture capitalist, in 2007. They have a daughter. Meng also has three older sons from previous marriages.\n\nThough Meng primarily lives in Shenzhen, the city in southern China where Huawei is based, she said she was at one point a permanent resident of Canada. Her family bought one home in the city in 2009, and another in 2016.\n\nMeng's lawyers have argued that she should be released on bail while she waits for an extradition hearing because of health concerns, including severe hypertension.\n\nShe was taken to a hospital to be treated for hypertension after she was arrested, according to court documents. She's also said to have survived thyroid cancer in 2011, and had surgery for health issues related to sleep apnea in May.\n\nMeng said she has a Hong Kong passport and a Chinese passport.\n\nUS officials claim that in the past 11 years, Meng has been issued at least seven passports from Hong Kong and China."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Jury says James Fields should get life in prison for Charlottesville murder", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/VUKuoZZjn34/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) A jury wants James Fields, convicted of killing paralegal Heather Heyer during a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, to serve life in prison on the murder charge, it decided Tuesday.\n\nJurors also recommended a $100,000 fine on the murder count.

Trump accepted ownership, telling the Democrats he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over border security.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,\" Trump told the top Senate Democrat. \"So, I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.\"\n\nTrump did not shed his bravado when he reinvited cameras into the Oval Office later Tuesday afternoon, maintaining that he is happy to take responsibility over a government shutdown.\n\n\"I don't mind having the issue of border security on my side. If we have to shut down the country over border security, I actually like that,\" Trump said, even as he characterized his meeting with Schumer and Pelosi as \"friendly.\" \"It's something the country needs. It's common sense. The country needs it.\"\n\nWhile the parameters of the political impasse have been known for months, the scene inside the White House Tuesday was a new escalation between emboldened Democrats, who will have the House majority starting in January, and Trump regarding his signature campaign promise. The deadline for funding is December 21.\n\nEven as Trump pressed Democrats for border wall funding, he once again claimed during a private portion of his conversation with Pelosi and Schumer that Mexico would be paying for the wall -- albeit indirectly -- Pelosi told members of her conference later Tuesday.\n\n\"He says, 'Mexico is going to pay for the wall.' I said, 'They're not paying for the wall.' He said, 'They're paying for the wall with the money we're gonna make over the newly revised USMCA,'\" Pelosi told Democrats, according to an aide in the room. \"I said, 'That isn't the fact. I'm gonna go out and tell people that you think that Mexico is paying for it with money that should be going into our economy.' \"\n\nNo progress toward averting a shutdown appeared to be made following the meeting, which for a sizable part was broadcast live around the world and featured the President and the heads of the opposing party openly interrupting each other to question motives and dispute facts.\n\nSchumer has urged Trump to either accept the Senate's bipartisan agreement to spend $1.6 billion to boost border security measures, or agree to a one-year spending resolution that would keep those funded at the current level of around $1.3 billion. Schumer said last week that money can be used for fencing and other features, rather than \"to construct any part of President Trump's 30-foot-tall concrete border wall.\"\n\n\"If he sticks to his position of a $5 billion wall, he will get no wall and he will get a shutdown,\" Schumer said as he left the White House.\n\nSparks fly\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's heated meeting in the Oval Office Replay More Videos ...

We don't want it,\" Schumer said of the shutdown. \"We gave him a good plan not to shut down the government and it will be a Trump shutdown and then on January 3rd, if it happens, the House will open us up again.\"\n\nThe easiest solution for Congress to avoid a shutdown and get out of Washington before the Christmas holiday could be to avoid the issue altogether and pass a short-term resolution to extend the rest of the federal government's spending into next year when Democrats take over the House. But Sen. John Cornyn, a top Republican, said Monday he didn't expect Trump to agree to that.\n\n\"That really just postpones the pain, it doesn't really solve the problem,\" said Cornyn in advance of the meeting, explaining that Trump still wouldn't get the wall funding he wants in that scenario.\n\nTrump's Senate allies have mixed reaction to meeting\n\nJUST WATCHED Tapper: This line will haunt Trump Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Schumer: Temper tantrum won't get Trump a wall 00:53\n\nDespite current Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump has little leverage to force Congress into appropriating money for the border wall. While \"Build the Wall!\" was perhaps Trump's most indelible campaign promise, Republicans in Congress are broadly less enamored than he is with the prospect of building it and Democrats still control enough seats in the Senate to block it.\n\nFor months, Trump's frustration at Congress' response to his demand has spilled out into public. From July through September, Trump repeatedly said he'd be willing to shutdown the government over the wall, backtracked and then reiterated he would do it because he views it as a political boost. Few on Capitol Hill agree that Republicans would politically benefit should parts of the government shut down.\n\nDemocratic leaders and the President appear to be far apart on the issue even though warning signs of the spending showdown have been flashing for so long.\n\nLast week, Pelosi called the proposed wall \"immoral, ineffective and expensive,\" while Trump claimed that the country would save billions of dollars if Congress would pass a bill to build it.\n\n\"Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and will continue to update throughout the day on Tuesday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: The reality TV president just got beat at his own game", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Dalo0SfUe3A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The best way to understand Donald Trump's approach to the presidency is to think of him as what he was before politics: The star and producer of a reality TV show. Trump is forever programming the show -- aka his White House and the country -- in ways he thinks will entertain, provoke and amaze the audience.\n\nAnd man, did he ever dial up a classic episode on Tuesday -- conducting an often-contentious public debate with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and likely House Speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi over border funding, the wall and who would be to blame for a government shutdown.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nIt was, without question, good TV. It was the sort of sausage-getting-made (or, perhaps more appropriately given how things transpired, not getting made) moment that the public rarely gets to see.\n\n\"We're here to have a conversation,\" said Pelosi at one point. \"I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press.\"\n\nAnd yet, have the debate they did! But as the three politicians were fighting -- and the fourth man in the room, Vice President Mike Pence, seemed very focused on trying to blend into the wallpaper -- something interesting happened: Donald Trump lost.\n\nHere's how it happened (bolding mine).\n\nPelosi said she wanted to avoid a \"Trump shutdown.\" Trump interrupted to note that the possibility of a government shutdown -- the federal government is set to run out of money on December 21 -- was entirely on Senate Democrats, who wouldn't support a bill to fund his border wall that he felt confident could pass the House whenever he wanted it to.\n\nThat led to this exchange between Trump and Schumer:\n\nSCHUMER: \"One thing that I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute, and you want to shut it down.\"\n\nTRUMP: \"The last time, Chuck, you shut it down, and then you opened it up very quickly. I don't want to do what you did.\"\n\nSCHUMER: \"Twenty times you have called for, 'I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall.' None of us have said it.\"\n\nTRUMP: \"You want to know something? ... I'll take it. You know what I'll say? Yes, if we don't get what we want one way or the other, whether it's through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government.\"\n\nSCHUMER: \"We disagree.\"\n\nTRUMP: \"And I am proud ... I tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So, I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down and I'm going to shut it down for border security.\"\n\nThat last line from Trump is an absolute dagger politically.\n\nIn both the run-up to and the aftermath of government shutdowns, both parties work very, very hard to blame the other side. The reason is simple: People hate Washington and think it doesn't work for them. When a shutdown happens, all their worst fears are realized. They get angry. The look for someone to blame. And that someone is always one of the two political parties.\n\nGiven that reality, why say -- and I am paraphrasing -- if I don't get what I want, I am going to shut down the government? The answer is that you wouldn't. Or at least no normal politician would.\n\nTrump is, as we know, not a normal politician. So why did he give Democrats such a gift in advance of the looming shutdown? Two reasons, I think.\n\n1. Schumer and Pelosi got under his skin\n\nRemember that Trump -- in his past life and in his presidency -- is used to telling people what to do and having them do it. He's set his White House up that way; he's surrounded primarily by family members and staffers who, generally speaking, tell him what he wants to hear.\n\nFrom the start of the public side of this meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, it was clear that wasn't the way this one was going to go. Schumer mocked Trump for touting Republicans' two-seat Senate gain in 2018 (\"When the President brags he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble\") and Pelosi scolded him for characterizing her relative strength within the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nTrump doesn't like that and isn't used to it. And he reacted poorly. He lost his temper a bit. He let Schumer goad him into owning a possible government shutdown.\n\n2. Trump believes his base wants the wall more than anything\n\nWhile I do think Trump let his ego and his temper get the better of him, I also think he has a deep belief that building the wall is keeping a promise of deep import to his base. Remember that his promise of a wall -- and his oath to get Mexico to pay for it -- was what sparked his longshot presidential campaign way back in the summer of 2015.\n\nWithout the wall, it's uniquely possible that Trump never moves from the less-than-zero spot he began at in early 2016 polling. Trump knows that the GOP base is deeply invested in the construction of a full southern wall and feels it is his duty to at least make good on that one campaign promise.\n\nAnd there is, without question, a bloc of Republicans (elected officials and base voters) who cheered Trump's performance with Schumer and Pelosi and who believe that a government shutdown might be a necessary evil to get what they want out of Congress.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that his loyal base isn't enough to get him re-elected. Or, as the 2018 midterms showed, to hold onto the House or a slew of other down-ballot races that went against Trump last month.\n\nNow anyone who watches TV in the next 24 hours -- so, most of us -- will see that clip of Trump promising to own the shutdown. Trump loves showing how politics really works. But this episode of his ongoing reality show made him look bad. And he hates that."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Michael Flynn asks federal judge to spare him from prison time in response to government sentencing memo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Ta74YpmGu-I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Former national security adviser to President Donald Trump Michael Flynn has asked a federal judge to spare him from prison time, echoing Robert Mueller's assertions that he cooperated early and extensively with the special counsel's Russia investigation.\n\nFlynn said his cooperation with Mueller's special counsel investigation \"was not grudging or delayed,\" according to a memo he provided to a federal judge before his sentencing.\n\nNeither Flynn nor Mueller has fully disclosed how his cooperation helped other ongoing Justice Department investigations, including the Russia probe. Mueller, however, has told the court Flynn gave prosecutors \"substantial assistance\" and has helped on at least three ongoing investigations.\n\nMueller told the judge he should not face prison time.\n\nOne year ago, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the substance of his calls with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak while he worked on the Trump presidential transition.\n\nRather, Flynn's cooperation \"preceded his guilty plea or any threatened indictment and began very shortly after he was first contacted for assistance by the Special Counsel's Office,\" his team wrote.\n\nHe is asking the judge for probation of less than a year instead of a prison sentence and has offered to do 200 hours of community service. His sentencing is scheduled for next week.\n\nCircumstances of his lie\n\nMeet the Mueller team Special counsel Robert Mueller assembled a team of at least 17 lawyers for his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nFlynn is the highest-ranking Trump official to face charges in the Mueller probe. He pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn initially denied -- but eventually admitted -- that they had discussed sanctions and a United Nations Security Council resolution during the presidential transition. The saga -- including the fact that he had lied to high-ranking administration officials about his contact with Kislyak -- led to his early exit from the White House.\n\nFlynn has long been suspected to be a central figure in an obstruction of justice inquiry focused on Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey around that time, who was overseeing the investigation of Flynn.\n\nTuesday's filing detailed his account of meeting with FBI investigators near the beginning of the Trump administration, and after Flynn had assumed the role of national security adviser. The memo acknowledges criticism of FBI officials and their actions in the days before Mueller's appointment to lead the Russia probe -- though Flynn still says he takes full responsibility for his lies.\n\nThe FBI chose not to involve the Justice Department when it first approached Flynn at the end of January 2017 to discuss his communications with Russians, Flynn's defense team said, citing evidence they had reviewed before his sentencing.\n\nFormer FBI agent Peter Strzok and another FBI agent visited Flynn at his office in the West Wing on January 24, 2017, when he first made the false statements. He did not have an attorney with him at that time, and was not warned he could be prosecuted for making false statements, his memo said.\n\nThe FBI \"decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed, and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport,\" an FBI agent wrote, according to the evidence cited by the defense team.\n\nThen-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who spoke to Flynn before the visit, said that if \"Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting, like the White House Counsel for instance, that I would need to involve the Department of Justice. (General Flynn) stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants.\"\n\nFlynn was in a good mood when he met with the agents that day, the memo said. He \"clearly saw the FBI agents as allies,\" an FBI agent reported.\n\nFlynn's defense attorneys said in the memo that even though the FBI agents involved have been hampered by criticism, the former national security adviser continued to own up to lying.\n\n\"Even when circumstances later came to light that prompted extensive public debate about the investigation of General Flynn, including revelations that certain FBI officials involved in the January 24 interview of General Flynn were themselves being investigated for misconduct, General Flynn did not back away from accepting responsibility for his actions,\" the defense team wrote.\n\nBefore he pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017, Flynn shared information with Mueller five times, then spoke to the Justice Department 14 additional times following his plea.\n\nHe's also given the Department of Justice \"thousands of documents,\" including from his two companies. In all, he's spent 62 hours and 45 minutes speaking with Mueller and other government investigators, according to his defense lawyers' memo Tuesday night.\n\nHis attorneys do not detail the date Flynn first spoke with the special counsel's office.\n\nDifferent from other Mueller cases\n\nFlynn's attorneys compared his case with those of defendants in the special counsel's probe who've gone to prison -- arguing his situation is much different.\n\nTwo other defendants -- the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- served 30 days and 14 days, respectively, after pleading to the same crime as Flynn: lying to investigators. But neither of those men helped Mueller with his investigation to the same extent or were as willing to cooperate and accepting of responsibility, write Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, Flynn's attorneys.\n\nAmong 13 cases where defendants in DC federal court went to sentencing for lying to the federal government, only van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos received prison sentences. The attorneys argued Flynn shouldn't face the same penalty as those two men, who were warned about the seriousness of the Russia investigation and the consequences they would face for lying when they first spoke to investigators.\n\nThe memo to federal Judge Emmet Sullivan, who will single-handedly determine Flynn's sentence, came accompanied Tuesday night with 50 letters of support from family members, friends and members of the US military, where Flynn ranked as a lieutenant general in the Army. The letters collectively attest to his character, sense of family and country, and service in the military and intelligence community.\n\nJack Keane, the former vice chief of staff of the Army who oversaw the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, described Flynn as an officer who \"single handily changed how we created, processed and used intelligence during combat\" after September 11, 2001.\n\n\"There is no doubt that Mike's contribution was consequential to mission success and the preservation of life,\" Keane wrote to the judge. \"I trust Mike completely and always will.\"\n\nOthers write about how the brother to eight grew up a competitive football and water polo player in Rhode Island, then became a diligent military member and later worked in intelligence.\n\nHis work for Trump, however, on both the 2016 presidential campaign and for less than a month in the administration, are minimized in the descriptions to the judge.\n\nHis sister, Clare Eckert, acknowledged that era of his life and the charges he faces since working for Trump.\n\n\"Little did I, or anyone in our family, realize what the future would hold for Michael and all of us who have all been profoundly affected by the devastating events that have transpired over the last few years,\" she wrote. Even so, Flynn continues to be \"the rock for all of us.\"\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Michael Flynn defense team sentencing memo asking for no prison time", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Hl3sHU3IVho/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Former national security adviser to President Donald Trump Michael Flynn has asked a federal judge to spare him from prison time, according to his defense team's memo before his sentencing.\n\n"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Animal attacks cost us more than $1 billion a year, and they're becoming more common", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/4I0Ica6JQ6c/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Animal-related injuries lead to health care costs of more than $1 billion a year in the United States, according to a new study -- and they're happening more often.\n\nThe rate of all animal attack injuries has increased over the past 10 years, according to Dr. Joseph Forrester , one of the authors of the study published Tuesday in the BMJ. He anticipates that it will continue to rise, partially because of climate change.\n\nThe most common cause of injury is bites from non-venomous arthropods, the group that includes spiders, mosquitoes, ticks and centipedes. As temperatures rise, the habitats of some of these creatures will get larger as they will be able to survive in more places, meaning they are able to injure more people.\n\nThe habitats of larger animals, such as bears, are overlapping more and more with human developments and recreational activities, as well, so injuries from these animals could also increase, the study says.\n\n\"We looked at approximately 20% of the emergency departments in the United States over a span of five years, so 2010 to 2014, and we looked at all the patients who came in who had diagnosis codes that corresponded to animal injury,\" said Dr. Joseph Forrester , one of the authors of the study published Tuesday in the BMJ.\n\nOver the five-year period, over 6 million emergency department admissions were linked to animal-related injuries. That works out to 1,291,507 people annually, or 19 injuries per 10,000 visits.\n\nThe data came from the Nationwide Emergency Department Survey by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Forrester and his co-authors used the World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases to identify those who visited the emergency department with animal-related injuries.\n\n\"First and foremost, the most common injury associated with an animal is not actually a bear or alligator, bottom line, it's actually things much smaller,\" said Forrester, a trauma surgery and critical care fellow at Stanford University.\n\nNearly half of the injuries, 41%, were related to bites from non-venomous arthropods. Dog bites were the next highest cause, accounting for 26% of the injuries. Third were bites and stings from hornets, wasps and bees, which made up 13% of the injuries.\n\nThe largest percentage of ER visits for animal-related injuries -- 42% -- was in the South.\n\nAnother important point noted in the study \"is that those people with the lowest incomes, and likely poor housing, are most impacted by the types of injuries that cause the most severe outcomes,\" Lorann Stallones , director of the graduate degree program in public health at the Colorado School of Public Health at Colorado State University, wrote in an email.\n\nThe study found that the highest group of patients, 34%, were in the lowest 25% household income for their ZIP code. These were also the patients most likely to be injured by bites from venomous snakes, spiders and arthropods.\n\n\"This finding has implications for public health prevention programs targeting injury reduction from preventable causes,\" said Stallones, who was not involved in the research.\n\nOnly 3% of those who were seen in an emergency department were admitted to the hospital. One-third of hospital admissions came from non-venomous arthropod bites. Those who had isolated abdominal injuries were most likely to be admitted to the hospital or die.\n\nAlthough there were a multitude of injuries in the study period, there were only 1,162 deaths, accounting for 0.02% of the emergency visits. Of those deaths, 278 came after a bite from a non-venomous arthropod, the largest number from a single cause.\n\nRat bites were the mechanism of injury with the highest frequency of deaths: 6.5 deaths per 10,000 bites. Bites from venomous snakes and lizards followed closely. Dog bites were responsible for the third highest rate of deaths.\n\nOne possible explanation for the higher frequency of deaths after rat bites could be diseases associated with them, according to Dr. Christopher Holstege , a professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Some of these diseases and infections include staphylococcus, rat bite fever and cellulitis.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that \"in addition to causing pain, injury, or nerve damage, dog bites can become infected, putting the bite victim at risk for illness or in rare cases death.\"\n\nHolstege pointed out that due to the codes used to identify animal injuries, \"it's hard for them to delve further into exactly why certain animals were related to mortality or related to admissions.\"\n\n\"I think what this article really does is give us a better snapshot in the modern era of the cost associated, and when you start looking at the cost and start trying to decrease health care costs, it's good to get data like this out so that we can also look at prevention efforts,\" said Holstege, who was not involved with the research.\n\nDog bites and non-venomous arthropods were the two most costly types of injuries, costing $1.36 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, over the five years analyzed. These categories, along with injuries from venomous snakes and lizards, which cost $898 million, accounted for approximately 60% of all the costs.\n\nHolstege suggests that the costs associated with venomous snake and lizard injuries could be due to the antidotes required.\n\nLooking at other methods of care is another way the costs could be decreased, according to Holstege.\n\n\"Very few of these cases were admitted to the hospital,\" he said. \"The question is, how many actually needed to go to an emergency department, and could costs have been decreased by either calling the poison center if it's envenomation with something that's poisonous, or talking to a primary care doctor?\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe authors note that the total cost of these injuries over the five-year period is $5.96 billion. However, there are also costs on top of this, including physician, outpatient and rehabilitation costs and costs of work lost.\n\nIf you are attacked by an animal, Forrester, Stallones and Holstege all advise seeking immediate medical attention, whether from an emergency department, a primary care physician or a poison control center."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "How to maintain your weight during the holidays", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/aKHB6AN4KRo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The average person gains 1 to 2 pounds between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, and those who are overweight often gain more, including children . Research shows that holiday weight gain is a major contributor to total yearly weight gain, so why not resolve to maintain your weight this holiday season? Here are 10 tips that may help.\n\nNever go to a party or dinner famished\n\nStart the day with a protein-rich breakfast -- eggs, a smoothie, Greek yogurt -- as this can help control your appetite throughout the day. In addition, have a healthy snack that includes protein, fiber and/or a little healthy fat -- fruit, nuts, turkey slices, yogurt, carrots and hummus or a protein bar -- before heading out the door so you don't make a dash for the cheese tray or bread basket the minute you arrive.\n\nPediatrician Dr. Tanya Altman gives her kids nut butter and sliced apples, cheese sticks, berries and yogurt prior to a party and advises that parents focus more on what kids should be eating rather than what they can't or shouldn't. Teach them what's important to eat for their brain and body: protein, fresh fruit and veggies, dairy, and then sweet treats in moderation are fine for a holiday dessert.\n\nDownsize your plate\n\nUsing larger plates at a buffet is associated with weighing more , and larger portions can increase calorie intake significantly -- and not just in adults. A study in children found that using larger plates significantly increased both the amount they served themselves and their calorie intake.\n\nPlate color seems to make a difference, too. A recent study also found that people ate 150 fewer calories when eating off white plates versus red or black plates.\n\nSurvey the buffet before filling your plate\n\nStudies show that people who survey a buffet before filling their plate tended to be trimmer. This is probably because they took the time to decide what they were going to indulge in rather than just loading up their plates as they went.\n\nWhen filling your plate, registered dietician Ashley Koff suggests using her Better Bites & Sips Rule: When choosing what you eat or drink, it should be a seven to 10 on a scale of one to 10, where one is medicine you have to force yourself to swallow and 10 is the best bite or sip you've ever had. Anything else, pass on, as we gain weight and get unhealthy from all the three to sixes we consume because they are \"just there.\"\n\nAnd weight loss specialist Dr. Adrienne Youdim tells patients, \"Eat what you want, provided that half your plate is green. By necessity, this cuts down on heavy stuff when you gotta get greens in.\"\n\nMake time for exercise\n\nDon't skip workouts, and be active whenever possible to burn off those holiday indulgences before they start to accumulate around your midsection. Take the stairs at the mall, park farther away at the grocery store, do pushups and jumping jacks while watching TV, and plan active outings for your family.\n\nGunnar Peterson , the Los Angeles Lakers' director of strength and endurance, suggests sequencing your strength-training workout by rotating through an upper-body exercise, a lower-body exercise and a core exercise, with no rest in between, to blast calories, build (or maintain) calorie-burning muscle and save time.\n\nLimit alcohol\n\nNot only are cocktails and alcoholic beverages high in calories , they increase appetite and decrease eating restraint, so they are a triple threat when it comes to maintaining your weight over the holidays. You don't need to restrict alcohol completely, just make sure to skip the high-sugar mixed drinks (opt for club and lime as a mixer instead) and alternate each alcoholic beverage (or any high-calorie drink) with a glass of sparkling water, Youdim suggests.\n\nBe wary of bite-size offerings\n\nBite-size appetizers and desserts can quickly add up to hundreds of extra calories, so pay attention and don't mindlessly eat appetizers or load your dessert plate with bite-size desserts. Limiting variety can help limit intake, as people tend to feel less satiated with more variety.\n\nGet on the scale regularly\n\nA new study in the British Medical Journal found that people who weighed themselves at least twice a week did not gain the typical 1 to 2 pounds that the average person gains over the holidays. If you hate weighing yourself, you can also choose a pair of snug pants to try on weekly to make sure your weight isn't creeping up.\n\nGet enough sleep\n\nHoliday parties, family dinners, shopping and travel can all cut into your sleep time, but do your best to get six to eight hours of sleep most nights. A study of adolescents found that intake of sweets increased 52% after sleep restriction , and total calorie intake increased 11%.\n\nEat less the day before or after indulging\n\nManage your calories like finances, nutrition physician Dr. Zhaoping Li suggests. If you have to borrow money, make money right away. It can be helpful to eat water-rich foods when you aren't going out to fill up with fewer calories. When you don't have social obligations, eat lots of non-cream-based soups, vegetables, yogurt, fruit and smoothies to balance out the extra calories you will be consuming the rest of the time.\n\nGet rid of leftovers\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you are having a party, stock up on Tupperware and send guests home with the leftovers, especially tasty holiday desserts.

The data came from 15 international studies previously conducted in a research project called the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group\n\nJUST WATCHED Breast cancer in young women Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Breast cancer in young women 00:59\n\nNone of the women had breast cancer when they were enrolled in the studies, which involved data from several European countries, the United States and Australia.\n\nThe data showed that, compared with women who had not given birth, women with children had an elevated breast cancer risk that peaked around five years after childbirth and continued for about 20 years -- regardless of whether women breastfed or not.\n\nThe researchers then noticed that this difference in risk among women who had had children and women who hadn't shifted about 23.6 years after childbirth.\n\n\"That's actually the point at which we started to not see much of a difference between the women who had a child and women who had not had children,\" Nichols said. \"As you went further out from there, then the benefits of having children started to emerge.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that, even though breastfeeding did not appear to influence the findings, other factors did, including the age at which a woman first gave birth, how many children she had and whether she had a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\"One of the things that we want our study to be able to do is to contribute to new tools that will help predict breast cancer risk more effectively for young women -- so women who might be trying to decide with their providers when to start having mammogram screenings,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"In order to have a good tool to do that prediction, we need to know how risk factors operate in young women, and it's becoming increasingly clear that we can't take the information or the patterns we see in older women and apply them to younger women and assume they'll be the same,\" she said.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that any breast cancer diagnoses during pregnancy in the data were not uniformly distinguishable from diagnoses made during early postpartum.\n\nAlso, the study was unable to explore the biological mechanisms behind why an association between breast cancer risk and childbirth even exists, but Nichols offered some ideas.\n\n\"What could be happening is that pregnancy is a time when there is rapid development of the breast tissue, and the cells in the breast are rapidly dividing, and we know that when tissue is expanding quickly that there's more potential for an error to occur within a cell or an error that's already there in the cell to have multiple copies made of it,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"So we don't think it's actually anything about pregnancy that's causing breast cancer. We think that it's possible that this rapid expansion of the breast tissue might make it easier for cancer cells to either grow or be started,\" she said, but more research is needed.\n\n'This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing'\n\nThough there is no clear explanation for this increase in breast cancer risk, young women should be aware of the small risk -- and that it can last for more than 20 years, especially if the woman is older during her first birth, has had several pregnancies or has a family history of breast cancer, said Dr. Francisco Esteva, medical oncologist at NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"At the same time, screening mammograms are not generally recommended in women younger than 40 years of age,\" he said. \"Therefore, if these results are confirmed, we would need novel approaches to identify breast cancer early in younger women, especially after childbirth.\"\n\nStill, women also should know that the study findings should not influence their decision-making regarding having children, said Dr. Erica Mayer, a medical oncologist and clinical investigator in the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Deciding when to get pregnant, or whether or not to get pregnant, can be an intensely personal decision. This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing, as the cancer risks observed are overall fairly modest, as well as on a large population level, and it's difficult to extrapolate these risks to an individual person,\" Mayer said.\n\n\"However, evaluating personal cancer risk in a premenopausal woman is important,\" she said. \"If a woman has a history that may influence risk -- such as a family history of breast cancer -- then she should discuss with her doctor the timing of initiation of mammographic screening, as well as whether referral to a genetic counselor would be helpful to evaluate for a genetic risk of breast cancer.\"\n\nOverall, the study found what has been seen in previous research, Mayer said.\n\n\"It's known that pregnancy at a younger age may confer some long-term protective benefits against breast cancer, however it's also been recognized that in the immediate years following a pregnancy, there seems to be an increased risk of breast cancer that slowly resolves with time,\" she said. \"The findings in this paper support and confirm the prior observations.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Nichols and colleagues' results add to a large body of evidence demonstrating a transient increase in breast cancer risk after childbirth. Given the consistency of this finding across studies, should women who have recently had a child make different decisions about breast cancer diagnosis, screening, or prevention? The answer, in general, is no,\" Armstrong wrote.\n\n\"Women with breast abnormalities should have a diagnostic evaluation regardless of time since childbirth,\" she wrote. \"All women should pursue the healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as exercise and limiting alcohol intake, that reduce risk for breast cancer -- again, regardless of childbirth history.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Breast cancer testing guidelines out of date, missing genetic screening", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/72Q_gWQVHtM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The current guidelines for genetic testing of breast cancer patients limit the number of women who can get tested. Because of these restrictions, these tests miss as many patients with hereditary cancers as they find, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n\"Unfortunately, insurance companies pay attention to these guidelines,\" said Dr. Peter Beitsch , co-author of the study and a cancer surgeon practicing in Texas. Insurance companies and other payers reimburse genetic testing -- or not -- based on the guidelines.\n\nThe result: Patients without genetic test results might not receive the appropriate treatment for their cancer, which could be a matter of life or death.\n\nApproximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States and of these cases, an estimated 10% are likely due to hereditary causes, according to Beitsch.\n\nThe guidelines are two decades old\n\nThe guidelines for the genetic testing of breast cancer patients were established about 20 years ago by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving patient care, explained Beitsch, who is a co-founder of the TME Breast Care Network, a nonprofit focused exclusively on advancing treatment for breast cancer patients.\n\n\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said. \"Back then we tested for two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA 2 ,\" said Beitsch. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumor suppressor genes that everyone has; if a defect or mutation occurs in one or both of these genes, the likelihood of breast cancer is increased.\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said.\n\nSince then it has become known that 11 \"major\" gene mutations, including BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, can cause breast cancer, while 25 or 30 other genetic variants are also linked to the disease, said Beitsch.\n\nMeanwhile, genetic testing \"radically changed. It went from a difficult-to-do, and expensive, test to a quite inexpensive test,\" said Beitsch. \"The cost dropped from, say, $5,000 for two genes to now we're doing 80 genes for about $250.\"\n\nWhile the guidelines also evolved, they \"got incredibly complicated,\" he said: \"unusable.\"\n\nSo Beitsch and his colleagues set up a study to look at nearly a thousand female breast cancer patients, half who met the criteria set forth in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the other half who did not. Among 959 study participants, all underwent a full panel of DNA testing for hereditary breast cancer.\n\nThe results showed that 83 women or 8.65% of the total participants, had breast cancer-linked genetic defects. Of these, 45 women met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria for testing, while 38 women did not. Ordinarily, then, these 38 women would not have been tested.\n\nGenetic testing may be a matter of life or death\n\nMany women who have breast cancer do not meet the criteria under the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, said Beitsch, and this affects their treatment and, potentially, their survival.\n\nDr. Otis Brawley , a professor in the department of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Emory University School of Medicine, explained that when a patient with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation is diagnosed, \"We treat them differently from a person with no known mutation.\" For example, surgical decisions and the use of chemotherapy might be based on whether a woman has a genetic mutation.\n\n\"Over the past 20 years we are learning of a number of genes that can have a mutation. Some change our treatment,\" said Brawley, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nGenetic testing, then, is not only important to a patient's survival, Beitsch said, \"but also for her family members as well.\" Carrying the same genetic mutation, a female relative may be at increased risk for breast cancer, while male relatives may be at increased risk for prostate and other cancers.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said that \"it's a misconception that men cannot be impacted by BRCA genes and it's a misconception that they cannot pass them onto their children.\"\n\n\"There's no question we don't test the people we know should be tested,\" including some patients with a \"family history that has cancer written all over it. Unfortunately, too many professionals don't pay attention,\" said Lichtenfeld, who did not contribute to the new research. One study, for example, suggests that fewer than one in five people who meet National Cancer Comprehensive Network criteria and have a history of breast cancer have actually undergone genetic testing.\n\n\"Then there's the group of people without a family history who want to get tested,\" he said.\n\nWill we all be routinely tested in the future?\n\npeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test. 2016 survey suggests that more than half -- 56% -- of American adults would be interested in taking a genetic test that indicated the likelihood of their developing cancer. The 30 to 64 age group had the highest proportion of willingpeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test.\n\nDespite public interest and increasing knowledge of potential causes of cancer, insurance plans do not routinely cover the expense of medical genetic testing, said Lichtenfeld. And barriers exist even for those who most need to know the results of such tests, such as some women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, he said: \"Once [a woman] is diagnosed, unless she has a family history, a lot of payers, including Medicare, will not pay for the test.\"\n\nSome patients pay for the testing on their own, but this is not possible for all patients. And some patients may be unaware of the need for medical genetic tests because the guidelines do not recommend they get it.\n\nSince genetic tests are now relatively inexpensive, the reason for creating an \"economic roadblock\" no longer exists, Beitsch said, and so the guidelines should \"be wiped.\"\n\n\"The guidelines really don't help -- in fact, they hurt, they injure, they keep people who could benefit from genetic testing from getting it,\" said Beitsch, who hopes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network will recognize his study \"and take heed of it and hopefully change the guidelines.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLichtenfeld said cancer centers \"are finding many more people who have a hereditary basis for their cancer than would have been suspected based on our previous knowledge.\" Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, scientists have become increasingly adept at reading the mysterious code and what \"we don't understand today, we will understand tomorrow or next year or in the next decade,\" said Lichtenfeld. He believes that soon, genetic testing will be routine for newborns.\n\nBased on his new research, Beitsch cherishes a more modest hope that at the very least all breast cancer patients will be offered and reimbursed for genetic testing, and perhaps, the same for all cancer patients."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Theresa May to face vote of no confidence from Tory MPs", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46535739", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May will face a vote of confidence in her leadership later on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement in Downing Street, Mrs May said: \"I will contest that vote with everything I have got\".\n\nShe said a new prime minister would have to scrap or extend Article 50, the mechanism taking Britain out of the EU on 29 March, \"delaying or even stopping Brexit\".\n\nConservative MPs will vote between 18:00 GMT and 20:00 GMT.\n\nMrs May said changing Conservative leader would \"put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it\".\n\nThe challenge to Mrs May's position comes after the required 48 letters calling for a contest were delivered.\n\nMrs May, who has been prime minister since shortly after the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016, has faced criticism in her party for the Brexit plan she has negotiated.\n\nIt is not yet known how quickly the result of the secret ballot will be announced, but Mrs May needs to get a majority in her favour to win it.\n\nIf that happens she cannot be challenged for at least another year.\n\nIf Mrs May does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand.\n\nThere is also an option that even if Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Iain Watson on what Theresa May faces now\n\nBecause the Conservative Party is the largest party in the House of Commons, whoever is leader of the party would be expected to be prime minister.\n\nIf Mrs May is ousted as Conservative leader later she would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new leader is selected by the party, a process that could take six weeks.\n\nIf there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members.\n\nSir Graham Brady, chairman of backbench Tories, who is overseeing the vote, said: \"We are looking at the leadership of the party and clearly the prime minister remains until there is a successor.\"\n\nSir Graham said he had told the prime minister on Tuesday evening that she would face a confidence vote.

The Pentagon refused to comment, stating that information about companies involved could not be disclosed.\n\nImage copyright ALEKSEY NIKOLSKYI/AFP/Getty Image caption Viktor Vekselberg (L) has met Russian President Vladimir Putin on numerous occasions\n\nWhat is the Jedi contract?\n\nIn a bid to compete with Russia and China, the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure (Jedi) is one of the most ambitious ventures the Pentagon has launched.\n\nInstead of military data being stored on smaller servers across different departments within the Pentagon, the information will be held in a cloud.\n\nThe cloud is a term used to describe a number of remote servers, connected to the internet, which can store vast arrays of information and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.\n\nTop military secrets will be transferred to the Jedi cloud, including classified details about weapons systems, military personnel, intelligence and operations.\n\nIt will provide soldiers on the front line with instant access to all of the latest intelligence, making them more effective on the battlefield.\n\nUS Brigadier General David Krumm, who helped to devise the contract, explained at its launch that having such information at the military's fingertips would help the US win wars.\n\nHe said: \"The information has to be available to an army platoon that a friendly unit is just around the block and will not open fire.\n\n\"It's got to be available to a platoon of marines who are about to breach a door that an IED has been found.\"\n\nThere have been warnings that if the Pentagon's IT system is not updated urgently, then the US will \"lose the future war\".\n\nHuge global technology companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and IBM have submitted bids, with a decision due in April 2019.\n\nLeading voices in the sector - including the other companies vying for the contract - say that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the clear frontrunner.\n\nWhy is the project so controversial?\n\nJohn Weiler, the director of the IT procurement group IT-AAC based in Washington, told the BBC: \"I would not store my most personal data, nor would my fellow colleagues, in a commercial cloud, period, the end.\"\n\nHe says there are huge risks to storing such classified information on a public, commercially-held cloud run by just one company.\n\n\"We have our nuclear codes, where our troops are going to be from one day to the next. If the cloud's security is breached, then our enemies could use our information against us. They could be waiting for us.\"\n\nThe Pentagon had to explain to Congress why it was only offering the contract to a single company, with calls for a cloud of this size to be run by multiple service providers to spread the risk of security breaches.\n\nIt said having just one cloud provider would better serve troops on the ground and would speed up access to vital information.\n\nAWS also defended the US government's position, stating: \"A single cloud would be more secure than a multi-cloud environment.\"\n\nThere have also been accusations that the bid has been written with just one company in mind, AWS, something the Pentagon denies, saying that the process has been transparent and impartial.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about AWS' links to the C5 Group.\n\nWho are Amazon Web Services and C5 Capital?\n\nAmazon Web Services has grown to be the biggest cloud service provider in the world. A subsidiary of the online shopping company, it controls a third of the cloud computing market.\n\nThe C5 Group is a relative newcomer but within a few years it has raised \u00a3100m ($125m) to invest in cyber-security.\n\nDespite AWS and C5 working together on a number of cloud computing projects all over the world, both companies have denied having a close relationship.\n\nOne of the many cyber-companies in the C5 group, C5 Accelerate claims on its website that it is \"developing a Cloud Accelerator Cluster in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the United States, alongside Amazon Web Services\".\n\nC5 maintains it has never made a joint contract bid with AWS of any kind in any country and has worked with other cloud service providers like IBM and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, the vice-president of AWS, Teresa Carlson, and the man behind the C5 Group, Andre Pienaar, have toured the world promoting their companies' relationship.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption AWS already has the necessary security clearances due to their involvement with the CIA's computing cloud\n\nThey have also joined forces on a project in the Middle East. AWS secured a contract to develop cloud-computing platforms for the Kingdom of Bahrain, and C5 came in to migrate government websites to the cloud.\n\nWho is Andre Pienaar and how is he linked to Russia?\n\nMr Pienaar, the man behind the C5 group, is a well-connected South African with business ties to a wealth of illustrious names.\n\nThe board of one of his flagship companies, C5 Capital, features a roll call of some of the most influential and trusted figures in military and security circles on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nHe also has links to Viktor Vekselberg, who is on the US sanctions list for his close ties to Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhen the BBC asked Viktor Vekselberg if he knew Mr Pienaar, he said that for two-and-a-half years, Mr Pienaar was a paid portfolio manager for his businesses in South Africa. That role only came to an end earlier this year.\n\nAccording to this version of events, he must have been working for Mr Vekselberg whilst running C5 and working on projects with Amazon Web Services.\n\nWhen the BBC put that to Mr Pienaar, he denied having ever worked for Mr Vekselberg's company, and said he had only advised them on a mining issue.\n\nShortly afterwards, Viktor Vekselberg's spokesman came back to amend their earlier statement to match Mr Pienaar's - which would suggest that they are still in contact.\n\nHow is his business, the C5 Group, linked to Russia?\n\nLooking through the labyrinthine structure of companies around C5, the BBC has found an injection of Russian money.\n\nOne of C5's subsidiaries, C5 Razor Bidco, brought in an investment of \u00a316.1m in 2015, just as Vladmir Kuznetsov became a director and major shareholder of the company.\n\nAWS stressed that it does not work with C5 Razor Bidco. However, C5 Razor Bidco is part of the C5 Group and is owned by Andre Pienaar.\n\nVladimir Kuznetsov is widely reported as being the trusted lieutenant of the sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.\n\nHe worked for the Russian oligarch from 1999 until earlier this year, when the sanctions against Mr Vekselberg led to mass resignations across the board of his business group, Renova.\n\nMr Kuznetsov told the BBC he had resigned from the majority of Mr Vekselberg's companies in 2014, apart from remaining on the board of Renova Management until April 2018.\n\nHe denied being his \"right-hand man\".\n\nThe BBC has also seen a document, published by an organisation called the Family Office Circle Foundation in 2016, which states that Mr Kuznetsov, who was speaking at one of their events, was from \"Viktor Vekselberg's family offices\" and was \"director of Renova Group\".\n\nMr Kuznetsov said his investment in C5 Razor Bidco was not influenced by either Mr Vekselberg or the Kremlin and the money came from his own bank account.\n\nC5 said that the oligarch had not directly or indirectly invested in any of the group's companies.\n\nMr Vekselberg said Mr Kuznetsov had never run \"his family offices\" and he had not made any investment in C5's portfolio through Mr Kuznetsov or by any other means.\n\nWho is Viktor Vekselberg?\n\nHis reputation in the US as a \"nice oligarch\" who spent his money on Faberg\u00e9 eggs was tainted in April this year when the US government sanctioned him for his close ties to the Kremlin.\n\nMr Vekselberg has said he will appeal against the sanctions, which have proved costly to some of his multi-million pound businesses.\n\nFormer Pentagon official Michael Carpenter, who was the deputy assistant secretary of defence overseeing Russia, told the BBC that he believes Mr Vekselberg \"poses a risk to the US\".\n\n\"Any oligarch in Russia, when called upon by the Kremlin, to do their bidding will do so, and that is the condition that they keep their wealth.\"\n\nShortly after his name appeared on the US Treasury's sanctions list, the billionaire was stopped as he tried to board a plane in New York.\n\nFederal agents working for the Robert Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election questioned him and seized his electronic devices.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing or involvement in President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nIt emerged earlier this year that Columbus Nova, a company affiliated to his Renova Group empire, paid \u00a3500,000 to Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's lawyer at the time.\n\nThe money went to his company, Essential Consultants LLC, the firm he used as part of a \"hush agreement\" with Stormy Daniels to prevent her publicising her alleged affair with Mr Trump.\n\nAndrey Shtorkh, a spokesman for Mr Vekselberg, told NBC News that neither Mr Vekselberg nor Renova \"has ever had any contractual relationship with Mr Cohen or Essential Consultants\".\n\nImage copyright Keystone SDA Image caption Vladimir Kuznetsov was the chief strategy officer for one of Viktor Vekselberg's key companies, the Renova Group\n\nWhat is Skolkovo?\n\nWhen the Skolkovo Innovation Centre was established by the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev back in 2009, when he was Russia's president, it was seen as the country's answer to Silicon Valley.\n\nViktor Vekselberg was brought in to run it and has remained at the helm ever since.\n\nIt was described as an incubator of the latest technologies which would create thousands of jobs and help reduce Russia's dependence on oil and gas, and allow it to compete with the West.\n\nHowever, a few years after its inception, warnings of potential espionage came from both the US military and the FBI, accusations that Skolkovo and Viktor Vekselberg strongly deny.\n\nBoth the FBI and the US military have warned that the innovation centre, designed to rival California's Silicon Valley, could be a front for \"industrial espionage\".\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Skolkovo is described as a \"technology incubator\".\n\nMr Vekselberg said it was with \"great regret\" that Skolkovo had been the subject of such criticism and that the centre worked closely with the US and many global technology companies as part of an \"ecosystem\" where \"innovation and entrepreneurship can thrive\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Theresa May to face vote of no confidence from Tory MPs",

SVENSSON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption A warmer Arctic has less food and more insects, making it a much worse environment for caribou\n\nThe population of wild reindeer, or caribou, in the Arctic has crashed by more than half in the last two decades.\n\nA new report on the impact of climate change in the Arctic revealed that numbers fell from almost 5 million to around 2.1 million animals.\n\nThe report was released at the American Geophysical Research Union meeting.\n\nIt revealed how weather patterns and vegetation changes are making the Arctic tundra a much less hospitable place for reindeer.\n\nReindeer and caribou are the same species, but the vast, wild herds in northern Canada and Alaska are referred to as caribou.\n\nIt is these herds that are faring the worst, according to scientists monitoring their numbers. Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - \"such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight\", this Arctic Report Card stated.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nWhy is a warmer Arctic worse for reindeer?\n\nThere are multiple reasons.\n\nProf Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating.\n\n\"We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation.\"\n\nImage copyright NOAA Image caption The Arctic is greening, but that is not good news for reindeer\n\nThe lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. \"Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAnother very big issue is the number of insects. \"Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,\" said Prof Epstein. \"It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou.\n\n\"If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects.\"\n\nRain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food.\n\nCan anything be done?\n\nAt the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase.\n\nImage copyright NOAA Image caption The Arctic Report Card revealed that the region was entering uncharted territory due to climate change\n\nBut scientists say we have opened the door on the \"world's freezer\" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate.\n\nThe report, complied by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\"In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,\" she said. \"And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nSome other key points from the report included:\n\nPlastic pollution: tiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris.\n\ntiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris.

Preliminary results of various investigations are being reported here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists.\n\nThe quake occurred on what is called a strike-slip fault, where the ground on one side of a rupture moves horizontally past the ground on the other side. It is not a configuration normally associated with very large tsunamis.\n\nNevertheless, this is what happened in the early evening of 28 September, around prayer time.\n\nTwo main surges of water were observed, the second being the biggest and pushing up to 400m inland.\n\nUdrekh Al Hanif, from the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, told the meeting that the generation source of the tsunami had to be very close to the city because of the short interval between the onset of the quake and the arrival of the high water - less than three minutes.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Scientists have sought answers on the bay floor\n\nHe and colleagues have sought answers in a depth (bathymetric) map of the long, narrow inlet that leads to Palu at its head. The team is still working through the results, but the data indicates the seafloor in much of the bay dropped down in the quake.\n\nThis, combined with a sharp movement of the crust northwards, could certainly have produced a tsunami, the Indonesian scientist said.\n\n\"When we overlap the bathymetric data from before and after, we can see that almost all of the area of the seafloor inside the bay subsides. And from this data, we can also observe [the movement] to the north.

In the September event, Palu witnessed a lot of liquefaction, where the structure of soils in the city was seen to collapse, to become fluidised and flow even on very low gradients.\n\nHouses were consumed in the mud. Local people call this \"Nalodo\", which means something like \"buried in black\".\n\nHermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said Palu demonstrated the challenge confronting the local population. \"This tsunami arrived very fast, within minutes,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That basically leaves no time for warnings. That's very different from Japan (in 2011) where there was an eternity of time - more than 30 minutes everywhere until the first person was killed by the tsunami. That's the challenge for these local tsunamis: people have to self-evacuate.\"\n\nWidjo Kongko, also from the BPPT, spoke of some complacency following an emergency drill conducted in Palu in 2012. \"It said go to high ground within 5-10 minutes.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

New York prosecutors urged a judge to sentence Cohen to a substantial prison term, saying he'd failed to fully cooperate and overstated his helpfulness. They've asked for only a slight reduction in the 4- to 5-year term he would face under federal sentencing guidelines.\n\nRevisiting of sentence\n\n\n\nA sentence of hard time would leave Cohen with little to show for his decision to plead guilty, though experts said Wednesday's hearing might not be the last word on his punishment.\n\n\n\nCohen could have his sentence revisited if he strikes a deal with prosecutors in which he provides additional cooperation within a year of his sentence, said Michael J. Stern, a former federal prosecutor in Detroit and Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\"Few things spark a defendant's renewed interest in cooperating faster than trading in a pair of custom Italian trousers for an off-the-rack orange jumpsuit,'' he said.\n\n\n\nAnnemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said prosecutors appear to be angry at Cohen for limiting his cooperation.\n\n\n\n\"It could be a tactic to try to break him like they've tried to do with [Paul] Manafort,'' McAvoy said, referring to Trump's former campaign chairman. \"It kind of shows they're putting the screws to him. If they're not mad at him, he didn't give them what they wanted.''\n\n\n\nCohen's transition from Trump's fixer-in-chief to felon has been head-spinning.\n\nDuring the campaign, he coordinated payments to buy the silence of two women \u2014 former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2014 who were thinking of speaking with reporters about alleged sexual encounters with Trump. Cohen once told an interviewer he would \"take a bullet'' for Trump.\n\n\n\nBut months after investigators began gathering evidence that he'd dodged $1.4 million in taxes, Cohen pleaded guilty in August, pledged to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and changed his party registration from Republican to Democrat.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said Cohen orchestrated payments to McDougal and Daniels at Trump's direction.\n\n\n\nTrump, who insists the affairs never happened, said Monday in a tweet mocked for its spelling errors that the campaign finance allegations are being made up by Democrats disappointed not to have found a \"smocking gun'' proving collusion between his campaign and Russia.\n\n\n\n\"So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution ... which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!'' Trump wrote.\n\n'Bring his toothbrush'\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge William Pauley III, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Bill Clinton, may allow Cohen to begin serving any prison term he receives at a later date. But legal experts said Cohen could also be taken into custody immediately.\n\n\n\n\"If I were advising him, I'd encourage him to bring his toothbrush to court,'' said Stern.\n\n\n\nCohen's lawyers have asked for no prison time, saying he has suffered enough already.\n\n\n\n\"The greatest punishment Michael has endured in the criminal process has been the shame and anxiety he feels daily from having subjected his family to the fallout from his case,'' his attorneys wrote in a court filing last month. \"The media glare and intrusions on all of them, including his children, the regular hate correspondence and written and oral threats, the fact that he will lose his law license, the termination of business relationships by banks and insurers and the loss of friendships, are but some of this fallout.''\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors said the request of a probation-only sentence is unbefitting of \"a man who knowingly sought to undermine core institutions of our democracy.''\n\n\n\nMueller's office took a far kinder view of Cohen's cooperation in a separate court filing, crediting him for useful insights about attempts by Russian intermediaries to influence Trump, among other matters.\n\n\n\nCohen's latest plea agreement, reached last month, requires he \"provide truthful information regarding any and all matters'' Mueller deems relevant. The same document bars Cohen from appealing his sentence unless his prison term exceeds federal guidelines, or he claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel in his proceedings.\n\n\n\nDavid S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, said Cohen's lawyers miscalculated by seeking an \"unreasonably lenient'' sentence.\n\n\n\n\"They got a little greedy,'' Weinstein said. \"Judges take a dim view of lawyers who have played the system.

A judge gave Manafort until Jan. 7 to respond to prosecutors' claims that he misled them about his interactions with an associate who they say has ties to Russian intelligence and with Trump administration officials.\n\n\n\nThe defendants, their fortunes sliding in opposite directions, represent starkly different paths in Mueller's investigation \u2014 a model cooperator on one end and, prosecutors say, a dishonest and resistant witness on the other. Even as prosecutors recommend no prison time for Flynn, they've left open the possibility they may seek additional charges against Manafort, who is already facing years in prison.\n\nThreats to Trump\n\n\n\nGiven both men's extensive conversations with prosecutors, and their involvement in key episodes under scrutiny, the pair could pose a threat to Trump, who in addition to Mueller's investigation is entangled in a separate probe by prosecutors in New York into hush-money payments paid during the campaign to two women who say they had affairs with the president.\n\n\n\nSince his guilty plea a year ago, Flynn has stayed largely out of the public eye and refrained from discussing the Russia investigation despite encouragement from his supporters to take an aggressive stance.\n\n\n\nFlynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, spent three decades in the military, including five years in combat. In a public statement after his plea, Flynn has said he cooperated with prosecutors because it was in \"the best interests of my family and our country.''\n\n\n\nIn Manafort's case, prosecutors have accused him of repeatedly lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. They say Manafort lied about his interactions with a longtime associate they say has ties to Russian intelligence, his contacts with Trump administration officials and other matters under investigation by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\nManafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in Washington in September and faces sentencing in a separate case in Virginia, where he was convicted of eight felony counts related to his efforts to hide from the Internal Revenue Service millions of dollars he received for Ukrainian political consulting."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Not Concerned About Impeachment, Defends Payments to Women", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-is-not-concerned-about-being-impeached-defends-payments-to-women/4697072.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was not concerned that he could be impeached and that hush payments made ahead of the 2016 election by his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to two women did not violate campaign finance laws.\n\n\"It's hard to impeach somebody who hasn't done anything wrong and who's created the greatest economy in the history of our country,\" Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview.\n\n\"I'm not concerned, no. I think that the people would revolt if that happened,\" he said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York said last week that Trump directed Cohen to make six-figure payments to two women so they would not discuss their alleged affairs with the candidate ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThey said the payments violated laws that stipulate that campaign contributions, defined as things of value given to a campaign to influence an election, must be disclosed, and limited to $2,700 per person.\n\nDemocrats said such a campaign law violation would be an impeachable offense, although senior party leaders in Congress have questioned whether it is a serious enough crime to warrant politically charged impeachment proceedings.\n\nImpeachment requires a simple majority to pass the House of Representatives, where Democrats will take control in January.

New York prosecutors urged a judge to sentence Cohen to a substantial prison term, saying he'd failed to fully cooperate and overstated his helpfulness. They've asked for only a slight reduction in the 4- to 5-year term he would face under federal sentencing guidelines.\n\nRevisiting of sentence\n\n\n\nA sentence of hard time would leave Cohen with little to show for his decision to plead guilty, though experts said Wednesday's hearing might not be the last word on his punishment.\n\n\n\nCohen could have his sentence revisited if he strikes a deal with prosecutors in which he provides additional cooperation within a year of his sentence, said Michael J. Stern, a former federal prosecutor in Detroit and Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n\"Few things spark a defendant's renewed interest in cooperating faster than trading in a pair of custom Italian trousers for an off-the-rack orange jumpsuit,'' he said.\n\n\n\nAnnemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said prosecutors appear to be angry at Cohen for limiting his cooperation.\n\n\n\n\"It could be a tactic to try to break him like they've tried to do with [Paul] Manafort,'' McAvoy said, referring to Trump's former campaign chairman. \"It kind of shows they're putting the screws to him. If they're not mad at him, he didn't give them what they wanted.''\n\n\n\nCohen's transition from Trump's fixer-in-chief to felon has been head-spinning.\n\nDuring the campaign, he coordinated payments to buy the silence of two women \u2014 former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2014 who were thinking of speaking with reporters about alleged sexual encounters with Trump. Cohen once told an interviewer he would \"take a bullet'' for Trump.\n\n\n\nBut months after investigators began gathering evidence that he'd dodged $1.4 million in taxes, Cohen pleaded guilty in August, pledged to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and changed his party registration from Republican to Democrat.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said Cohen orchestrated payments to McDougal and Daniels at Trump's direction.\n\n\n\nTrump, who insists the affairs never happened, said Monday in a tweet mocked for its spelling errors that the campaign finance allegations are being made up by Democrats disappointed not to have found a \"smocking gun'' proving collusion between his campaign and Russia.\n\n\n\n\"So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution ... which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!'' Trump wrote.\n\n'Bring his toothbrush'\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge William Pauley III, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Bill Clinton, may allow Cohen to begin serving any prison term he receives at a later date. But legal experts said Cohen could also be taken into custody immediately.\n\n\n\n\"If I were advising him, I'd encourage him to bring his toothbrush to court,'' said Stern.\n\n\n\nCohen's lawyers have asked for no prison time, saying he has suffered enough already.\n\n\n\n\"The greatest punishment Michael has endured in the criminal process has been the shame and anxiety he feels daily from having subjected his family to the fallout from his case,'' his attorneys wrote in a court filing last month. \"The media glare and intrusions on all of them, including his children, the regular hate correspondence and written and oral threats, the fact that he will lose his law license, the termination of business relationships by banks and insurers and the loss of friendships, are but some of this fallout.''\n\n\n\nFederal prosecutors said the request of a probation-only sentence is unbefitting of \"a man who knowingly sought to undermine core institutions of our democracy.''\n\n\n\nMueller's office took a far kinder view of Cohen's cooperation in a separate court filing, crediting him for useful insights about attempts by Russian intermediaries to influence Trump, among other matters.\n\n\n\nCohen's latest plea agreement, reached last month, requires he \"provide truthful information regarding any and all matters'' Mueller deems relevant. The same document bars Cohen from appealing his sentence unless his prison term exceeds federal guidelines, or he claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel in his proceedings.\n\n\n\nDavid S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami, said Cohen's lawyers miscalculated by seeking an \"unreasonably lenient'' sentence.\n\n\n\n\"They got a little greedy,'' Weinstein said. \"Judges take a dim view of lawyers who have played the system.

Alaskan scientists described to The Associated Press on Tuesday never-before-seen melting and odd winter problems, including permafrost that never refroze this past winter and wildlife die-offs.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday released its annual Arctic report card, detailing the second warmest year on record in the Arctic and problems, including record low winter sea ice in parts of the region, increased toxic algal blooms, which are normally a warm water phenomenon, and weather changes in the rest of the country attributable to what's happening in the far North.\n\n\"The Arctic is experiencing the most unprecedented transition in human history,\" report lead author Emily Osborne, chief of Arctic research for NOAA, said Tuesday.\n\n'A new Arctic'\n\nWhat's happening is a big deal, said University of Colorado environmental science program director Waleed Abdalati, NASA's former chief scientist who was not part of the NOAA report.\n\n\"It's a new Arctic. We've gone from white to blue,\" said Abdalati, adding that he normally wouldn't use the word \"scary\" but it applies.\n\nAnd that means other problems.\n\n\"Continued warming of the Arctic atmosphere and ocean are driving broad change in the environmental system in predicted, and, also, unexpected ways,\" the NOAA report said.\n\nOne of the most noticeable problems was a record low sea ice in winter in the Bering Sea in 2017 and 2018, scientists said.\n\nIn February the Bering Sea \"lost an area of ice the area of Idaho,\" said Dartmouth College engineering professor Donald Perovich, a report card co-author.\n\nThis is a problem because the oldest and thickest sea ice is down 95 percent from 30 years ago. In 1985, about one-sixth of Arctic sea ice was thick multi-year ice, now it is maybe one-hundredth, Perovich said.\n\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks marine mammal biologist Gay Sheffield not only studies the record low ice, but she lives it daily in Nome, far north on the Bering Sea.\n\n\"I left Nome and we had open water in December,\" Sheffield said at the American Geophysical Union conference in Washington. \"It's very much impacting us.\"\n\n\"Having this area ice free is having this massive environmental change,\" Sheffield said, adding there's been a \"multi-species die off\" of ocean life. She said that includes the first spring mass die off of seals along the Bering Strait.\n\nShrinking permafrost\n\nOrnithologist George Divoky, who has been studying the black guillemots of Cooper Island for 45 years, noticed something different this year. In the past, 225 nesting pairs of the seabirds would arrive at his island. This past winter it was down to 85 pairs, but only 50 laid eggs and only 25 had successful hatches. He blamed the lack of winter sea ice.\n\n\"It looked like a ghost town,\" Divoky said.\n\nWith overall melting, especially in the summer, herds of caribou and wild reindeer have dropped about 55 percent \u2014 from 4.7 million to 2.1 million animals \u2014 because of the warming and the flies and parasites it brings, said report card co-author Howard Epstein of the University of Virginia.\n\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Vladimir Romanovsky said he was alarmed by what happened to the permafrost \u2014 ground that stays frozen years on end. This past year, Romanovsky found 25 spots that used to freeze in January, then February, but never froze this year.\n\nBecause of warming, the Arctic is \"seeing concentrations of algal toxins moving northward\" \u2014 infecting birds, mammals and shellfish to become a public health and economic problem, said report card co-author Karen Frey.\n\nAnd the warmer Arctic and melting sea ice has been connected to shifts in the jet stream that have brought extreme winter storms in the East in the past year, Osborne said.\n\nBut it's not just the Arctic. NASA's newest space-based radar, Icesat 2, in its first couple of months has already found that the Dotson ice shelf in Antarctica has lost more than 390 feet (120 meters) in thickness since 2003, said radar scientist Ben Smith of the University of Washington.\n\nAnother study released Monday by NASA found unusual melting in parts of East Antarctica, which scientists had generally thought was stable.\n\nFour glaciers at Vincennes Bay lost nine feet of ice thickness since 2008, said NASA scientists Catherine Walker and Alex Gardner.\n\nLoss of ice sheets in Antarctica could lead to massive rise in sea level.\n\n\"We're starting to see change that's related to the ocean,\" Gardner said. \"Believe it or not this is the first time we're seeing it in this place.\""}, {"site":

The definition was created to help ensure that America's water was kept clean at the source, with the assumption being that it was necessary to regulate creeks, ditches and wetlands because they eventually flow into bigger bodies of water.\n\nBut farmers, construction companies and landowners bristle at what they say is the expansive nature of the definition, arguing the rules prohibit them from using a significant portion of land under their control.\n\nReacting to those concerns, the Trump administration is rolling back Obama-era protections in what EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler calls a \"simpler and clearer definition\" that will \"help landowners understand whether a project on their property will require a federal permit.\"\n\nThe new rules say that the federal government will now only regulate \"traditional navigable waters, tributaries to those waters, certain ditches, certain lakes and ponds, impoundments of jurisdictional waters, and wetlands adjacent to jurisdictional waters.\"\n\nThat leaves out huge areas of wetlands, meaning \"features that only contain water during or in response to rainfall (e.g., ephemeral features); groundwater; many ditches, including most roadside or farm ditches; prior converted cropland; stormwater-control features; and waste-treatment systems\" that were covered will no longer be subject to federal regulation.\n\nChristopher Williams from American Rivers says the new rules will remove \"protection from wetlands that don't have an apparent surface connection to another water body, a lake or a river, and there are millions of acres across the country that are isolated like that.\"\n\nThe argument is that these isolated bodies of water \u2014 some of which don't exist year-round \u2014 don't need protection because they don't impact the nation's major waterways.\n\nWilliams disagrees.\n\n\"These ephemeral streams are incredibly important parts of a freshwater ecosystem,\" he told VOA, adding that the Obama-era rules are scientifically dense and lay out the \"important ecological connections between all these types of water, whether it's wetlands or ephemeral streams, isolated or otherwise.\"\n\nThe old regulations made the case that these areas \"should all be included in the definitions of 'Waters of the United States' if you're trying to conserve that freshwater system as a whole,\" Williams said.\n\nSome environmental groups vow to fight the new rules.\n\n\"This proposal is reckless,\" Jon Devine from the Natural Resources Defense Council told VOA via email. \"... and we will fight to ensure it never goes into effect.\"\n\nThere is a 60-day comment period before the rule can be applied. In addition, the Obama-era regulations are in place in 22 U.S. states, while the rules are held up in court in another 28 states.\n\nEnvironmental policy changes\n\nWilliams sees a big change in the way the Environmental Protection Agency has evolved under the Trump administration.\n\n\"It's clearly changed in that much of the rhetoric of the current EPA is about balancing environmental regulations with economic development,\" Williams said, \"and making sure that they are efficient and not costly to the economy and don't interfere with business activity.\"\n\nTuesday's actions follow the U.S. refusal to endorse a new U.N. report on climate change at climate talks last week in Poland. They also follow a White House plan announced last week that would eliminate requirements that coal plants install expensive new technology designed to capture carbon emissions.\n\nSuch changes fall under Trump's campaign promise to roll back government regulation, saying environmental mandates amount to a \"war on American energy.\" The president also denies the scientific consensus that humans are warming the planet.\n\nResponding last week to the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment report produced by 13 federal agencies outlining the potentially devastating impacts of climate change, the president said, \"I don't believe it.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Groups Sue Trump Administration Over Atlantic Oil Testing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/groups-sue-trump-administration-over-atlantic-oil-testing-/4696492.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Environmental groups opposed to offshore drilling sued the federal government Tuesday to prevent future seismic tests for oil and gas deposits\n\nin Atlantic waters off the U.S. East Coast.\n\nSeismic testing, which uses air gun blasts, violates federal laws that protect marine mammals, endangered species and national environmental policy, according the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Charleston, S.C., against U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nThe fisheries service in November gave initial permission to five companies to conduct seismic airgun tests beneath a vast region off the East Coast.

Unsurprisingly, the news was leaked within seconds.\n\nWhen May got up in the Commons to confirm the news, there was a mix of derision and laughter from Opposition benches - and stony silence from the Tory benches behind her. \u201cOn one issue, the Northern Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern\u2026\u201d she admitted.\n\nThe House was packed tighter than a Budget Day, with cabinet ministers David Gauke, Chris Grayling, Damian Hinds, Jeremy Wright, Karen Bradley forced to stand. Gove arrived late, his earlier broadcast humiliation still ringing in his ears.\n\nReuters Theresa May in the House of Commons\n\nThe Chief Whip was initially missing from his perch at the end of the government front bench, but arrived mid-way through the PM\u2019s statement. \u201cThere is such a weird, unsettling atmosphere in here,\u201d one former minister told HuffPost via text. \u201cJulian looks like he\u2019s just eaten a wasp\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most wounding of all the criticism May suffered during another gruelling, three-hour session came from Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the DUP. \u201cFrankly, what the Prime Minister says today simply is not credible, is it?... Please, Prime Minister, really do start to listen and come back with changes to the withdrawal agreement, or it will be voted down.\u201d\n\nAs Dodds spoke, Gavin Williamson, who had also entered the chamber late behind the Speaker\u2019s chair, was looking avidly at his smartphone. It was apt that he was operating literally behind the scenes, because in many ways it has been Williamson - the former Chief Whip who hammered out the DUP-Tory alliance in the days after the snap election disaster - who has quietly tried to save the PM from herself in recent weeks.\n\nFor some Tory backbenchers, the most telling vignette came on the night of November 19. The DUP had just fired a \u2018warning shot\u2019 across the bows of the government by voting with Labour and against the Tories on the Budget.\n\nIn the wood-panelled Members\u2019 Dining Room overlooking the Thames, Williamson decided to sit with DUP MPs and chat to his old friends to rebuild bridges, despite their apparent break with the confidence and supply agreement that props May up in power.\n\nYet when Chief Whip Julian Smith happened to arrive in the same room, he acknowledged his colleague but blanked the entire DUP gathering. The snub did not go unnoticed. \u201cHe was incapable of dealing with disappointment and of moving on to the next vote,\u201d one backbencher said.\n\nThe DUP also \u2018heartily loathe\u2019 new Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, another MP confided. \u201cShe makes absolutely zero effort to understand them.\u201d The minister\u2019s admission in a House magazine interview in the summer, that she hadn\u2019t previously realised that nationalists and loyalists vote along sectarian lines, was just one example.\n\nPOOL New / Reuters DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson and then Government Chief Whip Gavin Williamson in 2016\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s beloved by the DUP. He gets their concerns, they have contempt for Bradley and for their official handlers, Damian Green and then Lidington, aren\u2019t on their wavelength at all. So even if they had been minded to dilute the sell-out, they were in no shape to sell it,\u201d says one who knows the Northern Irish party well.\n\nMoreover, Williamson \u2013 who actually proposed that May should give the DUP ministerial posts in 2016 - has told friends that \u201cburning the DUP is madness\u201d. He sees the danger as a threat to the life of the Parliament, May\u2019s main weapon with the vast bulk of Tory MPs, who are indifferent to Brexit either way.\n\nBut most of all it is the Whips\u2019 Office under Smith that is being held responsible for the fiasco of the last few weeks, with its roots starting last year.\n\nHe is being blamed for misreading last summer how dangerous it was to break with precedent and force MPs to abstain on Opposition Day motions. And when Labour started using an ancient procedural device of a \u2018Humble Address\u2019 to force the government to act on key issues like releasing Brexit impact assessments, Smith failed to spot how toxic it would ultimately become.\n\nSmith\u2019s allies point out he\u2019s lost just a handful of votes since taking over in 2017, no mean achievement given the wafer-thin, DUP-backed majority. Still, the \u201963 minutes of May-hem\u2019 last week, in which the Government lost three votes in quick succession, is what critics say confirmed the whips\u2019 failure to carry out their basic duty: \u2018count and then warn\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey should have spotted they were going to lose the Contempt of Parliament motion and pulled that vote and published the Attorney General\u2019s legal advice,\u201d one Tory MP said. \u201cThey got their numbers wrong, badly wrong. If they\u2019d got it right, we wouldn\u2019t be in the mess we are now.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the government whips\u2019 office seemed split on the Dominic Grieve amendment that aimed to give parliament more of a say on Brexit alternatives. One whip confided that they felt as if the chief and his deputy, Chris Pincher, were actually encouraging some MPs to back the Grieve plan, while others were advised by more junior whips to oppose it. \u201cIt\u2019s like they so wanted to scare Brexiteers, they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing,\u201d one of those involved said.\n\nHuffPost Michael Gove was among the ministers to insist the deal would go ahead.\n\nEach junior whip has to tend their \u2018flock\u2019 of MPs, normally split up on a regional basis. But several backbenchers have been surprised that their whips appear to have given up on them, and that the PM showed no interest in meeting them.\n\nPincher, known as \u2018Pinch\u2019 to colleagues, is now getting his own share of the blame. \u201cHe\u2019s got no relationship with the DUP and has no idea about policy. The best whips know the policy and the numbers, these guys know neither,\u201d one particularly furious rebel said. \u201cJulian is so often at No.10, it\u2019s Pinch who is the one over here [in the Commons]. And it ain\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nWith the big Brexit vote now expected to be delayed until January, one MP ridiculed the recent whips\u2019 empty threat to make parliament sit longer to eat into their festive break. \u201cIt\u2019s the Pinch who stole Christmas! He can\u2019t count so he\u2019s lucky there\u2019s an advent calendar to help tell him which day is which.\u201d Others point out that Pincher earns the same salary as the Chief Whip [\u00a3109,000]. \u201cIf the PM needs a scalp, surely it\u2019s his that\u2019s for the taking?\u201d\n\nOne grandee said that the most telling incident in recent days was that many MPs had gone to Williamson rather than Smith to pass on their concerns that the party would split if May went ahead with the vote. And Cabinet ministers relate that Smith has gone from reassuring the PM that she had \u2018the numbers\u2019 to becoming one of those warning postponement was vital to protecting the Government.\n\nWhat still rankles for many on the Labour side is the way Smith personally ordered Tory MPs to break their \u2018pair\u2019 with Opposition MPs to win a vote on the Trade Bill this summer. Party chairman Brandon Lewis was told to vote even though he paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who had only recently given birth.\n\nOpposition whips are reluctant to criticise their opposite numbers and in many ways sympathise, though not for long.\n\n\u201cWhips always get the blame when things go wrong but rarely get the credit when things go right,\u201d one said. \u201cBut the government\u2019s big mistake is trying to build relationships with MPs only at times of trouble.\u201d Labour also sees the Smith set-up as very hierarchical, with junior whips unable to be trusted with delegation. Every decision goes through \u2018The Chief\u2019, as he is known.\n\nMost puzzling to Labour has been the total absence of any attempt by either the whips or No.10 to engage with MPs in Leave seats who could possibly be tempted to back May\u2019s deal as at least a way of delivering the 2016 referendum. MPs like Lisa Nandy had no contact at all.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds\n\nOthers on the Tory side point out that the entire government whips\u2019 office lacks experienced, older hands needed to calm nerves in what is increasingly feeling like a minority government. As the ConservativeHome website has pointed out, Smith and Pincher and their loyal colleague Mark Spencer have been in post just two-and-a-half years, and the rest of their team on average just 18 months. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t any grown ups,\u201d one rebel says.\n\nTo make things worse, May has removed some of the better rated whips out into ministerial office. Former ministers who have sent warning shots in various votes have been ignored. Those with experience of Northern Ireland have not been approached for advice on handling the DUP either.\n\nDefenders of the whips say they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for what are ultimately Downing Street\u2019s tactical and strategical errors. Triggering Article 50 too early, ramping up expectation of a hard Brexit, triggering a doomed snap election, misreading the DUP a year ago, and even creating a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 are all blunders laid at the door of May and her top team.\n\nOne loyalist MP also pointed out that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his European Research Group allies had proved even worse \u2018counters\u2019 than the whips, not least when it comes to the 48 signatures needed for a vote of confidence. Yet the ERG has in fact deployed a disciplined whipping operation when its votes are needed to send a message to the PM, a former minister said.\n\nOthers sympathise that this set of whips is facing a group of hardened Brexiteer rebels who have learned from the Maastricht rebellions under John Major in the 1990s. Crucially, they have built an almost impregnable alliance with the DUP.\n\nIronically portraits of some of May\u2019s strongest critics, like David Davis and Michael Fallon, stare down from the Cabinet Office walls near No.9 Downing Street, official home of the Chief Whip. Both Davis and Fallon were whips themselves, and know all the tricks of the trade.\n\nOne incident last week highlighted the inadequacies in the current set-up. When \u2018independent\u2019 backbenchers tabled an amendment to give Parliament more of a say over the \u2018backstop\u2019, a trio of Hugo Swire, Bob Neill and Richard Graham were all keen to stress it was one way to prod the Government into assuaging Brexiteers\u2019 fears.\n\nHowever, the semblance of independence was blown when Pincher allowed himself to be spotted in the Commons Table Office, literally signing an extra name to the amendment. The fiction that this was anything other than a Government ploy was swiftly exposed.\n\nOne Tory had Pincher on the phone asking him to \u2018consider\u2019 signing the Swire amendment. When told it wouldn\u2019t solve deeper problems, the Deputy Chief Whip said he wanted names \u201ceven if you don\u2019t like it because we want to make sure the Speaker selects it.\u201d It was also pointed out that the motion was vital to showing the broader views of the Commons, as a counterbalance to the Hilary Benn motion (opposing \u2018no deal\u2019), if both should be passed.\n\nITV News was granted rare access to the Chief Whip's office, as he tries to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal ahead of Tuesday's vote.\n\nWe caught the argument as vocal Brexiteer Philip Davies insisted he was voting 'no' https://t.co/KHDQTdnQtA pic.twitter.com/MJjE7vdaXb \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) December 6, 2018\n\nSmith\u2019s decision to allow in the ITV News cameras to follow his efforts to win round MPs was also seen as woefully na\u00efve, given he later had to tell the PM he just couldn\u2019t win the vote. No.10 found out about the plan a week after the filming started, one source confided.\n\nOn Monday evening, the chaotic nature of this \u2018zombie\u2019 government on its most shambolic day yet was underlined with yet more ridicule. In line with convention, a junior whip tried to shout \u2018tomorrow!\u2019 to formally defer the Brexit vote to an unspecified date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common in the House to say \u2018tomorrow\u2019, this allow the Government to bring back a debate on a date of its choosing. This does not mean the debate will continue tomorrow,\u201d a No.10 source said.\n\nThe move worked, but it left a sour taste in the mouth of both Tory Brexiteers and Labour MPs. Veteran Conservative Peter Bone complained that he wanted Parliament to decide its own timetable, Labour wags heckled \u2018manana!\u2019\n\nLabour\u2019s Helen Goodman channelled Macbeth. \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day ..will it also be to the last syllable of recorded time?\u201d With Tory leadership contenders all gearing up for a Shakesperean contest of thwarted and unsated ambition, all eyes are indeed on the few days and weeks ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018The Chief\u2019 likes to joke to colleagues that he\u2019s had to deal with more sex scandals and reshuffles (nine in total) than he\u2019d bargained for. He has also told them his five-year-old is thoroughly sick of hearing the word \u2018backstop\u2019 at home. But so too are Tory and DUP MPs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "U.S. Military Ends Search For 5 Missing Marines After Crash Off Japan Coast", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/search-for-5-missing-marines-ends_us_5c0f5792e4b0edf5a3a80a08", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "TOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. military ended a search on Tuesday for five Marines missing in the sea off Japan since two Marine Corps aircraft were involved in an accident during an air-to-air refueling exercise on Dec. 6.\n\nThe five missing crew of a KC-130 Hercules refueling plane were officially declared deceased.\n\n\u201cWe know this difficult decision was made after all resources were exhausted in the vigorous search for our Marines,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell Maury, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 (USMC) Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron, said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts are heavy and our prayers are with all family and friends of all five aircrew.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Marines disappeared on Dec. 6 after an accident during an air-to-air refueling exercise.\n\nTwo marine pilots flying an F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter and the five crew members onboard the KC-130 Hercules went missing in waters about 200 miles off the Japanese coast following what U.S. officials have said may have been a mid-air collision.\n\nOne of the two Hornet pilots found by search and rescue teams died.

Despite his brash stance, they believe the turmoil has left him increasingly vulnerable as he gears up for what is sure to be a nasty fight for re-election.\n\nTrump, ever confident of his ability to bend story lines to his will, mocks the investigations into his conduct as candidate and president as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and insists he will survive the threats.\n\nBut a shift began to unfold over the weekend after prosecutors in New York for the first time linked Trump to a federal crime of illegal hush payments. That left some of his associates fearful that his customary bravado is unwarranted. For some Republicans, the implication that the president may have directed a campaign finance violation, which would be a felony, could foreshadow a true turning point in the Republican relationship with him when special counsel Robert Mueller releases his report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be a lot more that\u2019s going to come out from the Southern District (of New York) and from, at some point, from the Mueller investigation as well,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber\u2019s incoming No. 2 Republican, said Monday. \u201cWhat they\u2019re implying there, obviously, is something I assume at some point the president will have an opportunity to respond to.\u201d\n\nThune continued, \u201cCampaign finance violations are something that ... they are serious matters, but obviously it depends a little bit on how it gets treated.\u201d\n\nAs the legal drama plays out, political challenges that could threaten Trump\u2019s re-election are piling up.\n\nRepublicans are still coming to terms with their drubbing in last month\u2019s House elections and looking for someone to blame. The departure of John Kelly as White House chief of staff has set off a disorganized search for a replacement who could stay in the job through the 2020 campaign. After Trump\u2019s top choice, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff Nick Ayers, passed on the job, few of the remaining candidates have political experience.\n\nAlso, Democrats will soon take control of the House of Representatives, wielding subpoena power and potentially exploring impeachment proceedings. Meanwhile, financial markets have been jittery, in part because of Trump\u2019s trade wars and concerns that higher borrowing costs could ultimately trigger a recession.\n\nFacing pressure from Mueller and an impending onslaught of Democratic investigations, Trump could hew even further to the right, catering exclusively to the base of voters he is concerned about losing, according to a Republican close to the White House who has consulted on the early re-election efforts. That instinct would echo the president\u2019s double-down, scorched-earth response to the crises that hit his 2016 campaign, including the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape about forcing himself on women, and could make it harder to woo the independent voters or disaffected Democrats he may well need.\n\nCould Trump face a primary election challenge from within his own party? He doesn\u2019t seem concerned.\n\nThe president is eager to unleash his re-election machinery and begin to collect pledges of loyalty from across the GOP to quell any hint of an insurrection, according to a campaign official and a Republican familiar with the inner workings of the campaign but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Trump team has discussed the possibility of a challenge from someone such as outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. A week after the midterm elections, Kasich traveled to New Hampshire for a public speech and private meetings with prominent Republicans.\n\nFlake, who has tangled repeatedly with Trump, isn\u2019t making any personal commitment, but his feelings about a challenger are clear.\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to run\u201d against Trump, he said Monday. \u201cI hope somebody does.\u201d\n\nWhile some Democrats eying the White House are expected to announce campaigns in the first few weeks of 2019, a Republican challenger could move more slowly, according to two GOP operatives who have been involved in hypothetical discussions about taking on Trump. Waiting until early spring, for example, could give Republicans time to assess whether Trump will be weakened by Mueller\u2019s investigation or a downturn in the economy.\n\nOne leading House Republican said the situation surrounding Trump remains volatile and has urged colleagues to wait for the Mueller report, which some believe could emerge early next year. That Republican, who demanded anonymity to assess the situation candidly, has urged fellow GOP lawmakers to not defend the indefensible but to also not believe every charge. The lawmaker expressed hope that the special counsel\u2019s findings come out sooner rather than later so there will be more time before the 2020 elections.\n\nFor all the private and not-so-private party worries, many close to Trump predict he not only will survive the Russia investigation but will be re-elected in two years. They point to his remarkable ability to shake off scandal, the sway he continues to hold over his base of GOP voters, the fear his Twitter account has instilled among many Republican elected officials and what they believe is the lack of top-shelf talent among Democrats who could face him in 2020.\n\nEchoing the president, they contend the special counsel has come up empty-handed in his efforts to prove Russian collusion and is ready to settle for a campaign finance charge they believe is minor and will be ignored or not understood by most voters.\n\nThe president has said the lesson of the 2018 midterms is that Republican candidates abandon him at their own peril. And the Republicans who remain in Congress after that election aren\u2019t likely to back away from him.\n\n\u201cRemember that the Republicans who are left have won in fairly solid Republican, Trump districts,\u201d said moderate Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who is retiring. \u201cSo he is very popular with the base. I would not think that they would want to distance themselves or have any fear of associating with him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Julie Pace and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Twitter Users Mock Mike Pence's Lack Of Emotion During Trump Tantrum", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-no-reaction-twitter-trump-meltdown_us_5c101810e4b084b082fd9a7e", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "This photo was really from the Trump-Pelosi-Schumer fight today.

They thought he\u2019d hem and haw, as he has in the past, and then reluctantly sign the omnibus spending bill that\u2019s been working its way through Congress all year.\n\nRepublicans recognize that Democrats have hardly any incentive to give Trump wall funding, and the Democrats have most of the leverage in this fight. If Trump insists on a shutdown over the wall, Democrats can wait him out, pass a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the affected agencies when they take back the House in January, and then dare the GOP-controlled Senate and Trump to object.\n\nBut with Trump indicating Tuesday that he welcomes a shutdown \u2015 and would even be happy to take the credit or blame for one \u2015 Republicans are now reevaluating.\n\nDuring a meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dared Trump to put up an omnibus spending bill with the $5 billion he wants for a wall on the House floor and see if it could pass. Trump thinks it could. Pelosi is confident it wouldn\u2019t, figuring that enough conservatives would balk at the spending increases that GOP leaders would need Democratic votes \u2015 traditionally a good bet with these end-of-year spending bills, which typically draw the opposition of about 60 Republicans.\n\nBut GOP leaders are now wondering if there\u2019s something to Trump\u2019s plan. Could House Republicans pass an overarching spending bill \u2015 with wall funding \u2015 with only Republican votes?\n\n\u201cI think we could do it,\u201d a senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Tuesday. \u201cIt would be tight but doable.\u201d\n\nThe senior aide warned that it would still be \u201ca suicide mission, though, because we either shut down the government or cave and pass a CR into January.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr we pass an omnibus with nothing much for the wall,\u201d the aide added.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday that he thought Republicans could pass the spending package if it contained money for a border wall. \u201cModerates would be more of an issue on wall funding than the HFC,\u201d Meadows predicted.\n\nAnother Freedom Caucus conservative, Raul Labrador of Idaho, who has voted against a number of spending agreements in the past, said he thought conservatives could get onboard with a spending bill if it had wall funding and closed \u201casylum loopholes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the position the Freedom Caucus took Monday night, at least,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans seem to believe they could pass the spending bill on their own through a combination of Trump pressure and team spirit. It could be one final diss of Pelosi if the House GOP could come together and prove her wrong, particularly after she seemed to get the better of Trump repeatedly Tuesday.\n\nDuring the White House meeting \u2015 in front of the press \u2015 Trump said Pelosi wasn\u2019t in a position where she could speak freely about negotiations. Pelosi shot back that Trump shouldn\u2019t \u201ccharacterize the strength that I bring to this meeting.\u201d\n\nAnd when Pelosi returned to Capitol Hill, she further skewered the president in a meeting with Democrats.\n\nPelosi said the wall was \u201clike a manhood thing\u201d for the president. \u201cAs if manhood could ever be associated with him,\u201d she said, according to an aide in the room.\n\nThe comments have already been widely reported, and Pelosi almost seems to be goading Trump into a doomed shutdown that he\u2019s already taken the blame for. Schumer particularly got Trump to clarify that, if there was a shutdown, it would be Trump\u2019s doing \u2015 a political gift for Democrats.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a good chance Republicans and Democrats come to some small agreement and Congress and the president avoid a shutdown entirely.\n\nWhile it\u2019s an interesting thought-experiment whether Republicans could pass an omnibus spending bill with only GOP votes, that bill would still need to pass the Senate and its 60-vote threshold. Even if Republicans could peel off a few centrist Democratic votes, they\u2019re unlikely to get enough to muscle it through the Senate and onto the president\u2019s desk. And, at some point, Republicans have to face those facts. They\u2019ve gone down the path before of pretending they can bend Democrats to their will by shutting down the government.\n\nTrying to corral Republicans, many of whom are departing for the holidays and are already missing floor votes, to shut down the government over a wall that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for is a dangerous proposition, one that Republicans would likely lose anyway.\n\nBut with Trump suddenly vowing to fight, Republicans aren\u2019t ready to roll over.\n\nAccording to that same aide in the room, Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that they could go two routes with this meeting: \u201cwith a knife or a candy.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders Wants To Be Remembered For Being 'Transparent And Honest'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-huckabee-sanders-transparent-white-house_us_5c10832be4b0ac537179cd6e", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders hopes to be remembered for being \u201ctransparent and honest\u201d when her tenure as White House press secretary comes to an end.\n\nAs HuffPost has reported previously, Sanders has a well-documented history of giving false and misleading information to the press.\n\nPolitifact currently cites five times when Sanders has given objectively false information.\n\nWhat does @PressSec hope her legacy will be?

It\u2019s the real-life finding of a new report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe finding, like those schlocky TV spots, comes a big catch. The coverage itself would be threadbare. Most of those consumers would probably be better off paying the modest monthly premiums it would take to get insurance that\u2019s a lot more generous.\n\nRegardless, the statistic is a reminder that millions of people without any health insurance can still get covered for not a lot of money \u2015 but only if they sign up before the end of open enrollment, which in most parts of the country is Dec. 15.\n\nThe Kaiser report focuses on the availability and prices of \u201cbronze\u201d plans, which are the least generous of four types of health insurance that the Affordable Care Act has made available to people buying coverage on their own, rather than through an employer.\n\nThese are the plans sold through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run marketplaces, like Covered California or Maryland Health Connection. (A full list of state-run exchanges is here.) People who buy those plans may qualify for tax credits that discount premiums, sometimes substantially \u2015 by hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe sizes of the tax credits vary with income so people who need more help can get it. But the sizes of the tax credits also vary from market to market to adjust for local insurance prices.\n\nIn some places, and for some people, the tax credits are so big that they cover the entire cost of a bronze plan. In those instances, people can get bronze coverage for 2019 and spend literally nothing on premiums.\n\nKaiser researchers ran the numbers and figured out that, among people who are eligible to buy coverage through one of the marketplaces, about one-quarter of those who still don\u2019t have insurance could get free bronze plans. That works out to about 4.2 million people.\n\nOf course, bronze plans are cheap for a reason.\n\nThey cover preventive care for free, as all plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act must. But they don\u2019t pay for much else until bills hit a deductible \u2015 which, this year, averages $6,258 for an individual policy.\n\nThat is why policy experts, enrollment counselors and consumer advocates typically urge would-be buyers to check out \u201csilver\u201d plans, which are more generous.\n\nSilver plans aren\u2019t generally going to be free, even with large tax credits. The premiums are too high for that. But people with relatively low incomes \u2015 in other words, the ones who would get the big tax credits \u2015 still won\u2019t have to pay much. And they will be eligible for a special version of the silver plans that have lower out-of-pocket costs.\n\nFor people with incomes no higher than two times the poverty line, which is about $24,000 for an individual, average premiums for the typical silver plans are $20 to $130 a month, according to Kaiser, with annual deductibles between $239 to $3,169.\n\nThat\u2019s probably a better deal than bronze for most people \u2015 even the consumers who could get bronze at no cost.\n\n\u201cIf you have significant medical needs, paying a bit more each month for a silver plan can actually cut your potential health spending in half,\u201d Cynthia Cox, co-author of the report, told HuffPost.\n\nShe said that a low-income person who ends up in the hospital could end up with $7,000 in bills with a bronze plan, but less than $3,000 with a silver plan, even including the premiums, depending on the circumstances.\n\nOne reason for big discounts, ironically, is President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn late 2017, he decided to cut off one set of federal payments to insurers. Insurers had to raise premiums in response.\n\nBut in most states, they deliberately raised premiums on only a small subset of plans in a way they knew would trigger bigger subsidies from the government."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "U.S. Gun Violence Claimed More Lives In 2017 Than Ever: CDC", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-gun-violence-deaths-2017_us_5c0fc9a4e4b0edf5a3a90308", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Nearly 40,000 people were shot to death in the U.S. in 2017, a record number of annual firearm-related fatalities and a return to a gun death rate not seen in more than 20 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe year\u2019s 39,773 gunshot deaths equated to nearly 109 deaths each day, according to a data from CDC\u2019s WONDER database and first reported by the gun-focused news site The Trace.\n\nGun deaths have now risen for a third straight year, after more than a decade with little statistical fluctuation. The 2017 numbers increased 2.8 percent from 2016, and topped the previous yearly peak of 39,595 set in 1993 at the height of a U.S. epidemic of firearm-related murder and suicide. The 2017 rate of 12.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 people was the highest since 1996, when it was 12.8 per 100,000.\n\nThe 2017 increase in gun deaths was driven largely by rising suicides, which reached a total of 23,854, or around 60 percent of all gun deaths. Following years of relative stability, the rate of firearm suicides has grown steadily since 2007, especially among men \u2015 predominantly white men.\n\nAlthough gun homicides have fluctuated somewhat in recent years, firearm-related slayings rose slightly last year, reaching 14,542 \u2015 also the highest annual total since the 1990s.\n\nThe numbers came amid a year of bloody massacres, including the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a country music festival in Las Vegas. But the majority of the year\u2019s firearm deaths reflect a more routine form of gun violence, which has taken a disproportionate toll on poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.\n\nBlack men accounted for more than half of gun homicide victims in 2017, despite making up less than 7 percent of the population, according to an analysis by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety organization founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D).\n\nThe new data also shows that 2017 was the third straight year in which gun deaths outpaced traffic fatalities. It was also the first year that firearm-related deaths surpassed car crash deaths by more than 1,000, according to Giffords.\n\nTroubling as the CDC report is, it says nothing of the tens of thousands of people who each year survive gunshots. CDC data has been less reliable on nonfatal gunshot injuries, and recent reporting has called into question government estimates of a precipitous rise in nonfatal wounds in recent years.\n\nStill, the new CDC figures show why so many Americans are rallying around the cause of gun violence prevention, as demonstrated by midterm election victories by candidates favoring gun reform, Giffords said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Elon Musk Ducks Out Of One Los Angeles Tunnel But Pursues Another", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-los-angeles-tunnel_us_5bffb16ae4b0850623199de0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport.

In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M. Greally, a professor of genetics, medicine, and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cBut as usual, the story that\u2019s often told is overblown relative to the results, and too much causality is claimed.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Is Screen Time Bad for Kids\u2019 Brains?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/screen-time-kids-psychology.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nHave any such brain differences been found?\n\nNot convincingly. More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what the N.I.H. study aims to address?\n\nYes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain.
