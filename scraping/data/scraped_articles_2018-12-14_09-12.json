And the crimes for which Michael Cohen is going to jail aren't crimes after all; they were added to his rap sheet by prosecutors as a dig at Trump\n\nBut alternative facts go only so far, as Trump learned Thursday afternoon when Republican senators lobbed at him a resolution condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nTrump had ignored the clear conclusion of the CIA that bin Salman was involved in the killing when he issued an exclamation point-laden official statementlast month that it was unproven that Saudi Arabia and its crown prince were complicit. It wouldn't matter anyway , the President said, since Saudi Arabia is buying US military equipment.\n\nNow senators have slapped him on the wrist with Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker's resolution, passed by voice vote. They more narrowly voted to restricted US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, he still has to deal with Congress over the federal budget.\n\nAnd CNN reported late Thursday that Trump had been in the room when hush payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with him were discussed by Cohen and David Pecker, whose company publishes the National Enquirer.\n\nA new way for Mexico to pay for the wall\n\nTrump won't have much time to seethe at his allies in the Senate if he wants to keep the government up and running through the holidays.\n\nAfter a televised chess match in which he had declared he'd be proud to shut down the government if Congress wouldn't give him funding for his border wall and border security left him in check, the President opened the door to a change of course Thursday when he argued Mexico was already paying for the wall through the trade agreement he's pushing to replace NAFTA.\n\n\"I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall,' \" Trump said on Twitter. \"This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\"\n\nBut the reality is far different.\n\nThe trade deal hasn't been ratified by Congress yet. And even if it is ratified, a trade deal doesn't necessarily flood the federal coffers with money.\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer: Temper tantrum won't get Trump a wall Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer: Temper tantrum won't get Trump a wall 00:53\n\nIs the US going to be able to use the NAFTA replacement -- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- to pay for the wall?\n\n\"We're not,\" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. He ticked through possible revenue from a trade deal -- either directly through higher tariffs or indirectly via tax revenue from increased economic activity. There's nothing to suggest the USMCA will land the government a windfall on either count.\n\nEven if Mexico did start pumping money into the USMCA after it passes, Levy said, that doesn't mean it would go to the wall.\n\n\"There's nothing that earmarks this type of money for a wall,\" he said. \"Your income taxes or corporate taxes -- they go into general revenue. But it's still the budget process that determines where those funds go.\"\n\nAnd it's that budget process that has Trump stymied.\n\nSomeone in Washington will have to blink over the $5 billion the President has demanded and Republicans who control the House for less than a month can't deliver.\n\nDemocrats, measuring the drapes in House leadership offices they'll soon occupy, aren't in a giving mood since Trump wants the money to declare victory on a border wall they have vowed to fight.\n\nThe President drew the line in the middle of the Oval Office earlier this week when he all but dared soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer into shutdown mode by pointing out they had been blamed for a brief shutdown in January.\n\nThat's mostly true, but they had forced the shutdown over how to protect the children of undocumented immigrants raised in the US who Trump had stripped of a temporary protected status. Now, those people have been abandoned during the spending negotiations.\n\nInstead, the issue is the $5 billion Trump wants to beef up border security and start building his long-promised wall on the Mexico border. His tweet that Mexico would pay through the USMCA wasn't an entirely new argument, but -- timed immediately after he promised a shutdown -- it felt like the beginning of an out before parts of the government run out of money December 21 -- the same day Trump could get out of the White House and travel down to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas.\n\nThe public largely takes the Democratic side on the wall, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, in which 57% of Americans said they're against a wall , compared with 38% in favor. Those numbers are similar to where they were just after Trump took office in 2017. Most who favor the wall say they would continue to do so even if all the funding for it came from the US rather than from Mexico, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN's polling director.\n\nCrimes that aren't crimes\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Never told Cohen to do anything wrong Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Never told Cohen to do anything wrong 01:58\n\nTrump's view of the legal problems faced by former members of his inner circle is no less inventive.\n\nSpeaking to the Fox News host Harris Faulkner , Trump complained that the crimes his former lawyer pleaded guilty to weren't crimes after all.\n\n\"He made a deal to embarrass me,\" Trump said.\n\nWaving printouts of conservative opinion pieces at Faulkner, he said the payment made by the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., to \"catch and kill\" a story about his alleged affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal didn't come from him or his company, so he couldn't have been involved.\n\nThat's beside the point that prosecutors say the payment to McDougal , which Michael Cohen and AMI both now say was made to influence the election, amounted to an illegal campaign donation. CNN reported later Thursday that Trump had been in the room when Cohen and Pecker discussed the hush payment.\n\nTrump has denied having an affair with McDougal.\n\nCohen, his onetime fixer and lieutenant, is now -- in Trump's telling to Fox News -- a lawyer who \"did very low-level work.\" According to Cohen's guilty pleas, that work included orchestrating the payoff. Separately, Cohen was working to get a Trump Tower built in Moscow and trading on Trump's cachet as a political figure to do it.\n\n\"I never instructed him to do anything wrong,\" Trump said in the Fox interview. \"Whatever he did he did on his own. He's a lawyer.\"\n\nAgain, reality differs. Trump says the payments are not crimes, but Cohen is headed to prison. The President says Cohen was a low-level employee who once did him a favor. In truth, Cohen was a top lieutenant who spoke on behalf of his former boss and sought out business deals.\n\nAnother former aide who flipped on Trump, onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn, got better treatment from the President in the interview, in part, perhaps, because he thinks Flynn is stronger than Cohen but also because he doesn't know what Flynn told the special counsel's office.\n\n\"I don't even know what he said about me,\" Trump said of Flynn. \"Maybe they scared him enough he'll make up a story.\"\n\nIf Flynn says the President did anything wrong, Trump will surely have his own story to explain it away."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump was at the illegal hush money meeting, source says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/BR_1BXmY64E/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Donald Trump attended an August 2015 meeting that federal prosecutors believe was central to a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws to help Trump win the presidency, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to court filings, Trump was joined by Michael Cohen, who was his attorney at the time, and David Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., parent company of the National Enquirer.\n\nDuring the meeting, the group discussed a plan to shield Trump from potentially damaging stories.

Paul Manafort. David Pecker. Michael Flynn. President Donald Trump's enablers are falling one by one, and his dream world is becoming a hellscape. Trump, a famous self-promoter who has bragged about his wealth, intelligence, physical prowess and winning ways, faces the prospect of humiliation on a scale that would be genuinely world class. And his story is becoming a modern parable about the dangers of hubris and limits of fakery.\n\nThe President's former personal attorney Michael Cohen is the latest Trump associate to be sentenced to prison, after he pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, among other charges. According to prosecutors, Cohen admitted he \"acted in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump when he made or helped arrange hush money payments to a Playboy model and an adult film actress in order to silence claims they each had affairs with Trump before he was President.\n\nTrump, who has denied the affairs, appeared in a Fox News interview on Thursday to dismiss accusations of campaign finance violations, calling it a \"civil matter\" instead. He also went on to say, \"I never directed [Cohen] to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own.\"\n\nAt his sentencing the day before, Cohen offered an apology and told the court he had ignored his own \"inner voice\" and \"moral compass\" in order to serve his boss. It's hard to believe anyone with a working moral compass would have ever found himself in Cohen's position in the first place. Yes, it's possible a straight-shooter could have accepted an executive position in the Trump Organization, but anyone with an interest in honesty and fair-dealing would not have stuck around for as long as Cohen did. The lies Trump has told as President were foreshadowed by the manipulation he practiced as a private citizen\n\nDavid Pecker, CEO of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, was one of the most important guardians of Trump's media image. In the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections, AMI used the pages of its publications to gild the Trump image and attack his rivals, publishing one wild falsehood after another in an attempt to persuade readers that Hillary Clinton was either headed to jail or on the brink of death.\n\nOn Wednesday, federal prosecutors announced it had reached a nonprosecution deal with AMI. As part of the deal, AMI admitted it worked with Trump's campaign to pay Karen McDougal $150,000 in order to \"catch and kill\" claims she had a sexual affair with Trump.\n\nPecker is also said to have reached an immunity deal . Given that he agreed to suppress damaging claims about Trump in August 2015 , it's possible there are other stories that have yet to see the light of day.\n\nWhat would have motivated Pecker to buy the exclusive rights to stories about Trump, only to bury them? Perhaps he thought Trump would offer exclusive interviews in return, which might allow him to rake in more money through tabloid sales. But Pecker was already wealthy without Trump. He may have also appreciated Trump's power and influence, or simply enjoyed the time he spent in Trump's world.\n\nParties at Mar-a-Lago and Trump's other properties could be glittering affairs. The guest list for Trump's wedding to Melania Knauss, after all, included Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as Tony Bennett. The Trump image may have been built on false premises, but the tinsel was certainly real.\n\nOthers who became Trump allies may not have had better opportunities to gain the relevance they craved. The criminally convicted Paul Manafort, who flipped on the President only to be accused of lying to investigators, was a man without a candidate before he joined the Trump campaign in 2016 and steered it to the nomination. Having previously worked for Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Manafort must have seen that Trump was not fit for the role.\n\nAlthough Manafort backtracked in his cooperation with prosecutors, he may have already given them a look behind the Trump fa\u00e7ade. Certainly Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, is providing essential details on the truth about Trump.\n\nThe threats to the Trump image, and whatever substance lies behind his claim to extraordinary competence and vast wealth, go well beyond the information that may be provided by known cooperators. Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone has said he expects to be indicted, and several of his associates have been contacted for interviews or called to testify before a grand jury.\n\nLetitia James, New York's incoming attorney general, is also promising to investigate Trump's businesses and his charitable activities. If she discovers wrongdoing under state law, Trump's presidential pardon power will be useless because it applies only to federal offenses. To top it off, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will be able to conduct hearings and produce testimony that is likely to contradict many of Trump's claims about himself.\n\nFor more opinion...

The price paid by those who willingly aided in the mythmaking is high, as these disgraced figures and their loved one would attest. But no one who entered Trump's orbit and stayed there for a significant amount of time should have failed to see that Trump's main product was illusion.\n\nAs the Trump edifice crumbles, the President is not the only one in danger. Everyone who joined his businesses and his campaign, including his own children and top political operatives, likely faced moments when they needed to consult a moral compass. One wonders how many followed Cohen into the hellscape."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump inaugural committee under criminal investigation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TlyzB93cX-A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's 2017 inaugural committee is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in New York for possible financial abuses related to the more than $100 million in donations raised for his inauguration, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nCiting conversations with people familiar with the investigation, which is being handled by the US Attorney's office in Manhattan, the Journal reported that prosecutors are also looking into whether the committee accepted donations from individuals looking to gain influence in or access to the new administration.\n\nThe newspaper notes that \"giving money in exchange for political favors\" is illegal, as is misuse of any donated funds. The committee was registered as a nonprofit.\n\nIn a statement, Trump's inaugural committee said the celebration was \"in full compliance with all applicable laws.\"\n\n\"The (committee) is not aware of any pending investigations and has not been contacted by any prosecutors.

The President was focused on the transition at that time and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.\"\n\nAccording to the Journal, sources told the paper that the investigation \"partly arises out of materials seized in the federal probe of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's business dealings.\"\n\nDuring a raid of Cohen's properties last spring, a recorded conversation between him and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump, was seized, according to the newspaper. Wolkoff expressed concern in the conversation about how the inaugural committee was spending money, a person familiar with the Cohen investigation told the Journal.\n\nRick Gates, Trump's former campaign aide who has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, was asked by prosecutors about the committee's spending and its donors, the Journal reported, citing conversations with people close to the matter.\n\nTom Barrack, a real estate developer who ran the inaugural committee, has not yet spoken with investigators since an interview he had with the special counsel last year, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. During his conversation with Mueller, the inaugural fund was only raised briefly, the source said.\n\n\"The inaugural committee hasn't been asked for records or been contacted by prosecutors. We are not aware of any investigation,\" the source told CNN.\n\nThe committee, which CNN previously reported had raised a record-setting $107 million, received much of its funding from wealthy donors who gave $1 million or more, according to the Journal.

He opened fire on officers when they tried to question him, he said.\n\nPolice returned fire, killing the suspect, Castaner said.\n\n\"As I am speaking to you, I am thinking about the victims and the wounded. I am thinking of those close to them.

Five people remain in serious condition with eight others suffering light injures.\n\nThe hunt prompted a curfew in the eastern French city near the German border and forced the country to raise its national security threat level to its highest status: \"emergency terror attack.\"\n\nFrench prosecutors said the suspect shouted the Arabic phrase \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is greatest,\" at the time of the attack.\n\n\"It's relief for the people of Strasbourg to know that the attacker has been killed,\" Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries said, adding that the Christmas market would reopen on Friday.\n\nThe French National Police thanked the public for their assistance in finding Chekatt.\n\n\"Thank you for your alerts which allowed us to find the wanted individual,\" the National Police said on Twitter.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Paris prosecutor's office said that a fifth person was taken into custody in relation to the attack. \"At this stage there are five people in custody,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nAuthorities said Chekatt entered the perimeter of the market, one of the oldest in Europe, by the city's Corbeau Bridge and started shooting and stabbing passers-by on the Rue des Orfevres around 8 p.m., when many were in the middle of their Christmas shopping.\n\nAnti-terror police flooded the market and tried to arrest the suspected gunman. He exchanged fire with security forces, suffering an injury to his arm. The suspected gunman then jumped into a taxi and fled the scene, Heitz said.\n\nOn Thursday, French police evacuated buildings and cordoned off the area close to where Chekatt had fled. The gunman's father, mother and two brothers were also questioned by police, a source close to the investigation told CNN.\n\nCheckatt was already known to security services as a possible threat, police said. He has an extensive criminal background that includes 27 convictions in France, Germany and Switzerland, mostly for acts of robbery and violence.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Police, Cathy Maret, told CNN that Chekatt was well known to authorities there, having been arrested and convicted several times in Switzerland for crimes such as break-ins, theft and violence. He was not on their radar as a radical Islamist or for narcotics violations, she said.\n\nIn 2017, he was deported from Germany to France after the Interior Ministry in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg confirmed he had been convicted of break-ins and serious theft in 2016 and spent time in a German prison. The German Federal Criminal Office said the suspect was not known in Germany as a radical Islamist.\n\nMembers of the French police special forces take part in an operation at the Neudorf neighborhood in Strasbourg.\n\nHowever, Chekatt was known to French prison officials for being radicalized and for his proselytizing behavior in detention in 2015, Paris prosecutor Heitz said, adding that he had been incarcerated multiple times.\n\nHe was also on a French watch list called a \"Fiche S\" surveillance file. The \"Fiche S\" is a French terror and radicalization watch list that includes thousands of people, some of whom are under active surveillance, meaning they are on law enforcement's radar.\n\nHours before the attack, French gendarmes tried to bring Chekatt in for questioning but found he wasn't home, a spokesperson for France's National Police told CNN earlier this week, without providing further details.\n\nChekatt was born in Strasbourg, according to CNN affiliate BFM."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "EU tells May Brexit deal not up for renegotiation as wounded UK leader seeks lifeline", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/jQHN1ujQqFY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Brussels (CNN) The European Union will not throw British Prime Minister Theresa May a lifeline over Brexit, after she survived a bruising confidence motion triggered by members of her own party.\n\nLeaving Westminster convulsed by the crisis over her leadership, May came to Brussels to plead with EU leaders Thursday at a summit to make the agreement more palatable to skeptical lawmakers in London.\n\nAs she arrived, May said she was there to speak with EU leaders about what it will take to \"get this deal over the line.\"\n\nBut following the meeting, representatives of the bloc said they were sticking with the withdrawal agreement previously agreed with London, including the Northern Ireland backstop deal which threatens to derail it in the UK Parliament. May pulled a vote on the deal this week when it became clear she would suffer a heavy defeat.\n\n\"If we go into negotiations on the future relationship, we need to have a well-constructed proposal and a cogent idea from our British partners and friends, and then we'll look at that,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters.\n\nMay had been seeking legally enforceable guarantees surrounding the Irish backstop -- the insurance policy designed to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop has emerged as the crucial sticking point for many in May's Conservative Party, furious that Britain could only leave it with the approval of the EU.\n\nHardline Brexiters have argued that the risk of a \"no deal\" exit -- which would be devastating for the UK economy and British infrastructure, but would also damage the EU -- would compel Brussels to compromise, but EU leaders don't appear ready to blink.\n\n\"In terms of a no deal, let's not forget ultimately, it is within the gift of the UK government and the UK parliament to take the threat of no deal off the table,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Thursday.\n\n\"It is possible if the UK wishes to, to revoke Article 50, or, if that's a step too far to seek an extension of Article 50,\" he added, referring to the piece of EU law by which the UK triggered Brexit.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the EU leaders' summit in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nMay to 27: 'We must get this right'\n\n\"We must get this right,\" May told the EU27 on Thursday. \"Let's hold nothing in reserve. Let's work together intensively to get this deal over the line in best interest of all our people.\"\n\nShe said a route can be found for the Brexit deal to be approved by the House of Commons.\n\n\"We have to change the perception that the backstop could be a trap from which the UK could not escape,\" she said. \"Until we do, the deal, our deal, is at risk... the best result for all of us is to get this deal delivered in an orderly way and get it done now.\"\n\nMay called on leaders to trust her track record.\n\n\"Over the last two years, I hope I have shown you can trust me to do what is right, not always what is easy, however difficult that might be for me politically. ... With the right assurances this deal can be passed. Indeed it is the only deal that is capable of getting through my parliament.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, a Downing Street spokesperson confirmed to CNN that British MPs will not have to vote on May's Brexit deal before the end of the year. However, Downing Street has assured that it will take place before January 21, 2019.\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with May, Irish PM Varadkar told reporters that the \"deal that we have is the only deal on the table\" and made clear that he considered it the United Kingdom's responsibility to resolve the crisis.\n\n\"I think there is one thing that's undeniable. All these difficulties that Europe now faces, not least Ireland, but all Europe, we now face these difficulties because of a decision the UK made to leave the European Union,\" he said. \"We respect the decision they've made, but it does mean there is an obligation now on them to come up with the solutions.\"\n\nWhile May won Wednesday's confidence vote, by 200 votes to 117, the margin of victory was significantly narrower than her supporters expected and she arrived in Brussels with her authority further dented.\n\nAn EU diplomat told CNN that the other 27 EU nations were looking to May to \"convince\" them she can get the withdrawal agreement through the UK Parliament.\n\n\"We've seen what happened yesterday. Convince us that what you ask will make a difference. If she pulls that off then we can talk... in the end they are politicians and they will want to help her. We are ready to be convinced,\" the diplomat said.\n\nThe 27 are \"expecting serious clarification of what she plans to do,\" the source said, but for now, May appears to be \"playing for time\" in the hopes that uncertainty will win over the lawmakers she needs to back her deal.\n\nThe diplomat added that they are very concerned about an accidental hard Brexit, saying the \"most likely scenario is stumbling into a no deal.\"\n\nWhy is the Irish border backstop such a big issue? One of the big fears in the Brexit debate is that Britain's departure from the EU will mean the reintroduction of border posts on the frontier between Northern Ireland, which remains part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. Border infrastructure was often targeted by Irish nationalist paramilitaries during the \"Troubles\" -- the 40-year sectarian conflict in which more than 3,500 people died. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal avoids the reintroduction of a so-called \"hard\" border, because of the built-in transition period that keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU. The problems come if there's no agreement on what to do after the transition period ends in 2020. Enter the Irish \"backstop,\" an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border if no other solutions are found by that time. This has infuriated hard-line Brexiteers, worried the UK will never \"properly\" leave the bloc. They want to be free of the customs union, in order to forge international trade deals that would require the UK to be free of EU regulations on issues like agriculture, fisheries, food standards and the environment. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs prop up May's minority government in London, also demands a clean break with the EU, and oppose any move to give Northern Ireland different status from mainland Britain. The big sticking point is that the Brexit deal, as it stands, states that neither side can leave the backstop unilaterally. Brexiteers hate the idea that the EU would hold a power of veto over the UK. But others, including the Irish government, argue that the backstop would be meaningless if Britain could tear it up at will.\n\nEuropeans are holding firm\n\nArriving in Brussels, EU leaders suggested they could offer greater clarity around the deal -- but there was little sign they would make changes substantial enough to win over May's critics at home.\n\n\"The thing now tonight is we have to seek clarifications, particularly on the backstop,\" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. \"There is this whole thinking in the UK that this backstop is inevitable, that it will be triggered. I can assure you one thing, there is nobody in their right mind in the European Union who wants to trigger the backstop because this is bad news not only for the UK but also for the EU.\"\n\nRutte added that it would be \"impossible to break open\" the withdrawal agreement, saying: \"This is the only deal possible on the table.\"\n\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz echoed that message. \"The deal we already have is a good one. I think there is also an understanding from Theresa May that there will be no new negotiation of the withdrawal agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"But, of course ... I think there will be some readiness from our side to maybe find some better explanation about the future relationship ...

Importantly, the strategy remains true to his central campaign promise to put the interests of the American people first, both at home and abroad,\" Bolton told the audience at the Heritage Foundation on Thursday.\n\n\"Under our new approach, every decision we make, every policy we pursue, and every dollar of aid we spend will further US priorities in the region,\" he said.\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration's approach appears to lean heavily on the promise that the US will be able to advance trade and commercial ties with nations across the region by exposing the \"predatory practices pursued by Russia and China.\"\n\n\"Great power competitors, namely China and Russia, are rapidly expanding their financial and political influence across Africa. They are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the United States,\" Bolton said.\n\nBy focusing economic efforts \"on African governments that act with us as strategic partners, and, which are striving toward improved governance and transparent business practices,\" Bolton said the US will help prepare those nations address security threats, including terrorism and militant violence.\"\n\n\"Our goal is for the nations of the region to take ownership over peace and security in their own neighborhood,\" he added.\n\nCNN reported last month that the Pentagon has already approved a long-awaited plan to reduce the number of US troops conducting counterterrorism missions in Africa over the next three years, despite senior US military commanders warning last year that the terror threat in many African nations was growing, particularly in West Africa.\n\nThe planned reductions are part of a broader global effort intended to help better align the US military's global posture with the Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy, which focuses more on \"near-peer\" competitors like Russia and China as opposed to counterterrorism missions.\n\nA senior defense official said that the US would be \"changing, and yes, reducing some of our efforts\" and said \"by recouping some of this investment, it allows us to train, experiment and plan for the near peer competitors.\"\n\nThe administration's economic push in Africa is also intended to challenge inroads that have allowed China and Russian to exert a growing amount of influence on the continent.\n\nChina has a strong foothold in Africa, though, with massive infrastructure spending and development. While it will be difficult for the US to confront Beijing's influence in the region, distrust of China's lending policies is growing and Bolton said the administration intends to capitalize on that discontent.\n\nIn October, the New York Times reported that \"episodes involving discriminatory behavior by the region's growing Chinese work force have unsettled many Kenyans, particularly at a time when their government seeks closer ties with China.\"\n\nFor it's part, Russia \"is also seeking to increase its influence in the region through corrupt economic dealings,\" according to Bolton, who said Moscow \"advances its political and economic relationships with little regard for the rule of law or accountable and transparent governance.\"\n\n\"In short, the predatory practices pursued by China and Russia stunt economic growth in Africa; threaten the financial independence of African nations; inhibit opportunities for US investment; interfere with US military operations; and pose a significant threat to US national security interests,\" Bolton said.\n\nOne problem is that the US is not clearly seen as the better option for African nations with Trump at the helm.\n\nThe Trump administration has cut aid to Africa for vital health programs that have real impact on lives and no one forgets the January Oval Office meeting where the President decried immigrants from the continent as coming from \"shithole\" countries , comments that prompted a rare public a rebuke from several African leaders.\n\nTrump also waited more than a year to meet an African leader, though Bolton alluded to a potential upcoming presidential trip to the continent.\n\nStill, Bolton claimed that the Trump administration is prioritizing Africa in a way previous administration's failed to do, emphasizing the long-term goal of helping nations in the region become self-sufficient.\n\nBut at the same time, the Trump administration has already cut several programs intended to foster long-term development from the ground up, a move that has raised questions about the US commitment to working with nations in the region in a mutually beneficial way.\n\nOne such program is the State Department's Young African Leaders Initiative, a group of young people who have been chosen from pool of applicants in the tens of thousands, to come study in the US because they are actively making their communities better in some way at home.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, YALI programs have been cut by one-third, meaning hundreds fewer students from throughout sub-Saharan Africa are able to come to the US, according to Neil Piper, executive director of The Presidential Precinct, which hosts the Mandela Washington Fellowship.\n\n\"This program is reaching people throughout Africa, in places where no one else is going. There is a lot of bipartisan support for it,\" he told CNN. \"Now this is 250 fewer young leaders per year -- who are actually making positive changes in their home communities -- who won't have this kind of support and exposure to the United States. It's a big missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"In Africa, it's clear that China is making investments on the ground. Looking for opportunities to make real connections will be key. Otherwise, we're going to be left behind by other countries willing to do this,\" he added.\n\nBut Bolton argued that the US has spent billions of taxpayer dollars on aid to Africa and little has changed.\n\n\"They have not stopped the scourge of terrorism, radicalism, and violence. They have not prevented other powers, such as China and Russia, from taking advantage of African states to increase their own power and influence,\" he said.\n\n\"Our new foreign assistance strategy would ensure that all US foreign aid, in every corner of the globe, advances US interests,\" Bolton added. \"From now on, the United States will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without accountability, and relief without reform.\"\n\nBolton's approach was also criticized by humanitarian groups.\n\n\"While we commend the recognition of African countries as important trade and security partners, the strategy falls short in providing a coherent approach to preventing violent conflict and terrorism across the continent,\" Richmond Blake, Director of Policy and Advocacy for Mercy Corps said.\n\nBlake also observed that \"a commitment to advancing human rights and democracy\" was absent from the strategy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "High-speed train crashes into bridge, killing seven, in Turkey", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/vjKz1rQzYeE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A high-speed train crashed Thursday in the Turkish capital of Ankara, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more, according to the city's governor.\n\nAt a press conference at the site of the crash, the governor, Vasip Sahin, said 46 people had been hurt in the crash, which took place at around 6.30 a.m. local time.\n\n\"Our hope is the number of dead does not increase, but our units are working,\" Sahin said. \"Once their work is complete, we will be able to share more information.\"\n\nThe train collided head-on with a maintenance vehicle in Ankara's Marsandiz station, causing part of a bridge to collapse onto two carriages, state news agency Anadolu said.\n\nRescue workers search through wreckage after a high-speed train crash Thursday in Ankara, Turkey.\n\nTwo of those injured were in a critical condition, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told the agency, adding no more wounded were at the crash site as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Bomb threats emailed to multiple locations across the country", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/tbKXCdJ9Kr8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Dozens of businesses and institutions across the United States and Canada received email threats Thursday afternoon, prompting evacuations and sweeps of buildings.\n\nGuy Dickinson tweeted this photo of police at 17th Street and K Street Northwest in Washington, DC on Thursday afternoon.\n\nAt this time it's unclear if the threats -- which have been received in San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Miami, Washington, DC and other locations nationwide -- are connected.

The chief said the department's review will focus on the 108 rape kits that CNN identified as being destroyed since 2010 before a statute of limitation expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. Seventy-five percent of those kits, tied to cases reported as recently as 2014, were never submitted to a lab to be tested for DNA, CNN found.\n\nSpringfield Police stood out from other agencies for the variety and volume of investigative shortcomings that led to kit destruction and how quickly rape kits were destroyed. Dozens of untested kits were destroyed in a year or less after victims reported being assaulted, according to department records.\n\nExperts who reviewed Springfield case files at CNN's request called practices they saw in its investigations \"disturbing.\" The police imposed 10-day deadlines on victims shortly after they reported being assaulted. If victims did not respond in time, their cases were closed and their kits destroyed while prosecutions were still viable. The police also gave victims waivers declining their option to prosecute before thorough investigations had been conducted, a tactic that effectively ended cases.\n\nOutraged by revelations in CNN's investigation, the grassroots organization asked for the meeting with Williams so he could respond to their questions and requests. Police declined to open the discussion to journalists.\n\nIn their meeting, Me Too members said they asked the chief to notify every victim whose kit was trashed and reopen those cases if possible.\n\nWilliams rejected that idea, according to Sarah Bargo, Me Too's secretary, because the chief said he feared that contacting victims risked re-traumatizing them.\n\nWilliams told Me Too that he is working with The Victim Center , Springfield's primary rape advocacy group, to use the center's hotline -- 417-864-SAFE -- as a way for victims to ask questions about their cases or rape kits.\n\nVictim Center director Brandi Bartel told CNN that the plan is in its early stages. Victims who call the line could give the center permission to pass their questions to police. Bartel expects that the police department would then contact the victim directly.\n\n\"I want to be helpful,\" she said. \"But I want to be clear -- we are not law enforcement. We are not attorneys.\"\n\nSince CNN's story published, one victim whose case is currently being investigated has contacted the department to learn the status of the rape kit, according to written answers police gave to Me Too and provided to CNN. Two other victims have told police they feel their cases were mishandled.\n\nThe department declined to discuss those cases, citing the victims' privacy.\n\nSpringfield Police Chief Paul Williams told an advocacy organization his department would review rape kit destruction.\n\nMe Too members asked Williams if he would consider bringing in outside experts to review the department's current sex crimes investigations. Such reviews are considered best practice in policing.\n\nWilliams told the group that he's reaching out to an organization that may be able to \"spot check\" Springfield's sex crimes cases, Me Too vice president Kelsey Nichol told CNN.\n\nWilliams said the agency has stopped imposing 10-day deadlines on sex crime victims or giving them prosecution declination waivers.\n\nMe Too also asked Williams about the department's backlog of untested kits. Williams had previously told the group that he ordered a review of all kits in 2014 and found that the agency had more than 300 on hand. Williams told Me Too that police had reduced the number of untested kits to 237 and expected to finish testing the rest within two years.\n\nMe Too members told CNN they wanted more information about the state's intention to establish a system to track rape kits as they make their way from police to a lab for testing. Williams told them that discussions about that will begin after the first of the year.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the Missouri Attorney General's Office said that Attorney General Josh Hawley \"hopes grant funding will allow Missouri to test existing kits and establish statewide protocols that will prevent any kit from going untested in the future.\"\n\nMembers left the meeting feeling good, they said.\n\n\"I went into the meeting feeling apprehensive,\" Nichol said. \"But it went very well. We felt heard by the department.\"\n\nElsewhere, a police chief in Lapeer, Michigan, who apologized for his department's destruction of rape kits , told CNN on Thursday that he's taken several steps since the story appeared to improve his agency's handling of cases. David Frisch said he's created a policy specific to sexual assault investigation, updated the department's evidence policy and gotten members of the department training on sexual assault.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney general in Washington state said he would notify every law enforcement agency in his state and direct them to ensure that rape kits are not being inappropriately destroyed.\n\nIn New York, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the destruction of kits by a police department in his state \"disturbing.\" The governor has directed state police to contact the agency and ensure it is \"complying with state law regarding the handling of rape kits,\" spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement.\n\nIn Georgia, state Rep. Scott Holcomb told CNN that its investigation prompted him to begin writing legislation to introduce next session that would outlaw destruction of rape kits before the statute of limitations expires.\n\nAnd, national nonprofit organization the Joyful Heart foundation took action. Its program End the Backlog is credited with persuading state lawmakers across the nation to enact laws requiring the testing of rape kits. Days after CNN's investigation, it updated its model legislation to include a provision stating, \"Kits associated with a reported crime that is uncharged or unsolved should be preserved for 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations, whichever is greater.\"\n\nCNN's investigation \"shined a bright light on a largely unknown\" problem, said Ilse Knecht, the Joyful Heart foundation's director of policy and advocacy.\n\n\"You can't say all kits should be tested if kits are destroyed.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "North Carolina's election fraud scandal has both parties planning for another campaign", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/P1Snqu2eP5o/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) Republican and Democratic officials in North Carolina are beginning to maneuver for position in anticipation of a fierce and protracted second campaign in the state's scandal-ridden 9th Congressional District.\n\nLeaders from both parties have all but publicly agreed that a new election is necessary, but they are pursuing much different paths to winning it.\n\nDemocrats are zeroing in on Republican nominee Mark Harris' ties to operative at the center of the alleged election fraud, demanding the Harris personally address the depth of their relationship, while escalating nationwide fundraising appeals to back their candidate, Dan McCready. Republicans have sought to nudge Harris from the stage, most clearly by moving to mandate a new primary in the case a new general election is called, and by suggesting -- as one senior party official did to CNN -- that the mess has rendered him damaged political goods.\n\nOn Thursday night, The Washington Post added to those doubts with a report that Harris decided to hire Dowless earlier in the campaign than had been previously known -- and in defiance of warnings about his criminal background and rumors of shady tactics.\n\nThe decision to re-run the midterm race, which Harris initially appeared to have won by a slim margin in November, ultimately rests with the State Board of Elections, which is overseeing an investigation into allegations of an absentee ballot fraud operation directed by an operative on the payroll of a firm hired by Harris.\n\nIn North Carolina and around the country, Democrats are rallying around McCready ahead of the board's as-yet-unscheduled evidentiary hearing, sending out calls for campaign cash and, at a press conference in Raleigh earlier this week, hammering Harris over his refusal to explain the extent of his relationship with the operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Tammy Baldwin have also asked supporters to donate to McCready.\n\nHarris has not spoken publicly since last Friday, when he denied in a taped statement having any prior knowledge of misconduct committed on his behalf. Dowless previously denied any wrongdoing to the Charlotte Observer and has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWith the affidavits piling up and elections board probe potentially widening, Republicans fearful that the scandal has made Harris effectively unelectable and vulnerable to still more unsavory revelations, are both in the media and through their legislative actions moving to nudge him off the field.\n\nOn Wednesday, the North Carolina state legislature, which is controlled by a lame duck Republican supermajority, passed a bill with Democratic support that would require any call for a new general election to also include a second primary. For the GOP, that means a chance for Republicans like Rep. Robert Pittenger or, according to some rumors, former Gov. Pat McCrory, to challenge Harris and potentially prevent him from being re-nominated.\n\nIt is unclear whether Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will sign the Republican bill.\n\n\"North Carolinians deserve honest and fair elections and the Governor is reviewing this legislation carefully,\" said Ford Porter, a spokesperson for Cooper.\n\nRepublican leaders have stopped short of calling on Harris to seek a legal avenue for exiting the race entirely, but one senior state GOP official told CNN the Charlotte-based pastor's odds are getting longer.\n\n\"There is a growing realization of whatever the final facts are and irrespective of their personal affection for Mr. Harris -- he is facing an insurmountable political problem that could have a major impact on the party,\" the official said, before questioning Harris' long spell of public silence: \"One taped statement and no interviews in 14 days? That is a death wish in a political situation like this.\"\n\nHarris has not responded to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nRepublicans might be souring on Harris, but they aren't about to cede the 9th District seat. Two GOP state lawmakers on Thursday acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of fraud, but argued that the problem affected voters of all stripes -- and should not be viewed in through a partisan lens. (There are no credible allegations of fraud or misconduct against the Democrat McCready's campaign.)\n\nIn response to a fundraising email sent out Thursday afternoon by the North Carolina Democratic Party, which is seeking to frame the ongoing scandal as a swindle perpetrated by state Republicans known for \"passing monstrous voter suppression laws to rigging our maps,\" GOP state Sen. Dan Bishop lashed out and accused Democrats of seeking to make political hay out of a \"very serious issue.\"\n\n\"The gall, I mean it really does take brass ones, to go out and run fundraising drives alleging that this is a Republican thing,\" Bishop told CNN, \"and of course exploiting as an opportunist the situation that is emerging driven by a media frenzy.\"\n\nAsked if he had confidence in the state elections board, Bishop suggested it could be compromised by the ascent of a Democrat to its top position, saying the investigation \"ought to be a fair process and those who are in positions like the Board of Elections must set aside their partisanship and proceed in a way that's fair.\"\n\nState Sen. Mike Woodard, a Democrat who supported the bill that would attach the new primary to a new general election, said the party was prepared to rally behind McCready should the board follow through as he expected and ultimately call for a second vote.\n\n\"In backing Dan (McCready) and on insisting that all the votes count and that we have a thoroughly legal, aboveboard process that helps restore our confidence in voting, the party has taken the right steps to get here,\" Woodard said. \"If we're moving toward a March primary, and an election sometime in the spring, I'm confident our party will do that.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Slain teen 'might be alive' if authorities hadn't overlooked evidence, prosecutor says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/9hsUAscGoR8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The kidnapping and killing of 13-year-old Hania Aguilar may have been prevented if authorities had properly handled DNA evidence from a separate case last year, a North Carolina prosecutor said.\n\nRobeson County District Attorney Luther Johnson Britt told reporters on Wednesday that authorities had evidence linking suspect Michael Ray McLellan to a rape case for at least a year but they took no action.\n\n\"This hurts,\" Britt said. \"This is like taking a punch to the gut and not being prepared to get it.\"\n\nThe county's sheriff and district attorney offices were notified in October 2017 that DNA recovered from a 2016 rape kit possibly matched McLellan.

The committee was registered as a nonprofit.\n\nIn a statement, Trump's inaugural committee said the celebration was \"in full compliance with all applicable laws.\"\n\n\"The (committee) is not aware of any pending investigations and has not been contacted by any prosecutors.

These were funds raised from private individuals and were then spent in accordance with the law and the expectations of the donors.

It was, um, chummy -- with Faulkner asking Trump questions like \"What do you love about being President?\" and \"You have such energy for this.\" (Yes, I know the latter isn't a question at all.)\n\nI went through the transcript -- which covers the sentencing of his former attorney Michael Cohen, Trump's dealings with China and why he doesn't get better press -- and plucked out the, uh, \"best\" lines from the President. They're below.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. \"I don't think -- and I have to go check. I don't think they even paid any money to that tabloid. I don't think we've made a payment to that tabloid.\"\n\nTrump's argument here -- I think -- is that because neither he nor the campaign ever paid the National Enquirer any money to buy Playboy model Karen McDougal's silence about an alleged affair, then he did nothing wrong. This isn't accurate because even if it's true, the donation from American Media Inc. -- the Enquirer's parent company -- would have had to have been disclosed as an in-kind contribution to the campaign. Why? Because, in a settlement announced Wednesday , AMI admitted that it paid McDougal $150,000 for her story so as to keep it from hurting Trump in the election.\n\nAlso: And away we go!\n\n2. \"These are campaigns. Nobody except for me would be looked at this like -- nobody.\"\n\nWell, we don't know of any other presidential campaigns that paid two women alleging affairs with the candidate $280,000 to keep them quiet, constructed an elaborate scheme to ensure no one found out about it and then, when people did, repeatedly lied about it. So...\n\n3. \"Have you ever heard of campaign finance list?\"\n\n[searches memory banks] Um, no.\n\n4. \"Number one they say it's not a campaign finance violation. Number two, or it's not even under campaign finance -- number two if it was, it's not even a violation.\"\n\nWait. \"Number one\" and \"number two\" are the same thing. Right?\n\n5. \"You know President Obama had a really big one from 10 times more money -- much more money and you know what? He paid a fine. I'm the only one that this happens to.\"\n\nThis is a very common refrain from conservatives when it comes to the campaign finance violations related to Trump. OBAMA DID IT TOO, they insist. Except, no . The Obama campaign did pay a $375,000 fine to the Federal Election Commission for not disclosing the identity of donors making large contributions in the final two weeks of the 2008 race. That's clearly wrong -- and the fine Obama paid was one of the largest ever levied by the FEC. But it's not even close to the same thing as constructing an elaborate mechanism -- in coordination with the National Enquirer -- to buy the silence of women who are threatening to come forward and tell of affairs they allegedly had with the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n6. \"These people writing stories that Trump did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.\"\n\nTrump is cherry-picking a very small group of conservative campaign finance lawyers to argue that \"everyone\" says that he is innocent of any campaign finance violations. This is not even close to true. The VAST majority of campaign finance experts believe this to be a clear violation of in-kind contribution and donation reporting laws.\n\n7. \"He did very low-level work.\"\n\nTrump's take on Cohen's role within the broader world of Trump, Inc. is belied by known facts. Not even Trump now disputes that Cohen handled the payoffs of two women who were alleging they had affairs with Trump. (And worth noting, federal prosecutors have said they believe Trump directed and coordinated these efforts.) Now ask yourself: Would you put a \"low-level\" person in charge of handling something this sensitive -- not just in your political life but in your personal life as well? And the answer is OF COURSE NOT.\n\n8. \"But he did -- so if you'd see him on television, he was OK on television.\"\n\nA good reminder that television is Trump's lens on the world. It's how he views everyone and everything, including, once, Cohen. He liked Cohen because he saw Cohen on TV. And thought Cohen did a good job.\n\n9. \"I did a great job, Trump World Towers, a very tall building right opposite the United Nations, and when you build a building people always get together at the end and they make a settlement with the owner.\"\n\nTwo things here: 1) Trump is telling Faulkner that Trump did a great job 2) Trump World Towers is a \"very tall building.\" Some say it is the tallest building. Many people say it actually.\n\n10. \"They put those two charges on to embarrass me. They're not criminal charges, number one.\"\n\nThe campaign finance charges against Cohen are, of course, criminal charges . And not only has Cohen pleaded guilty to seeking to break campaign finance law, but the Southern District of New York has said they believe that Trump directed and coordinated that effort.\n\n11. \"So what happened is either Cohen or the prosecutors, in order to embarrass me, said, 'Listen, I'm making this deal for reduced time and everything else, do me a favor, put these two charges on.'\"\n\nThis provides a fascinating window into Trump's worldview. He is deeply conspiratorial and hugely transactional. As a result, he thinks everyone -- including law enforcement -- operates the same way he does. That federal prosecutors would risk their careers and the reputation of their office by creating fake charges -- and that Cohen would simply plead guilty to those fake charges to lessen his jail time. Also this should go without saying, there is no evidence for what Trump is alleging.\n\n12. \"I never directed him to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own. He's a lawyer.\"\n\nHere's the problem with Trump's attempted ignorance-is-bliss defense: Federal prosecutors have said they believe he not only knew about the scam to keep the payment hidden but that he directed and coordinated it.\n\n13. \"[Cohen] did some bad things and -- income taxes evasion, I heard about taxi cab -- I heard about a lot of things.\"\n\nHe did! He pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges -- including two related to his attempts to mask hush-money payments to McDougal and Daniels. Which are crimes.\n\n14. \"Now, how many people, when they say, 'Listen, if you embarrass the President of the United States we'll give you a deal, your father-in-law, your wife, we'll cut you a deal.' That's all it is. It's a terrible system we have.\"\n\nAgain, Trump has zero evidence to back up this claim that there was some sort of massive deal cut by prosecutors and Cohen. He's just suggesting it because he knows his base wants something to cling to so they can say that the whole Cohen plea is rigged and therefore meaningless.\n\n15. \"But they took a general that they said didn't lie and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal. And now they're recommending no time. You know why? Because they're embarrassed that they got caught.\"\n\nOK, so follow this logic. Trump argues that Cohen made things up to embarrass him -- and that's why his former fixer only got three years in jail. But to explain why the special counsel's office recommended no jail time for retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump suggests it's because Flynn was too tough? I mean ... the mind boggles.\n\n16. \"I think it's amazing because I only get bad news. I only get bad stories. You look at the paper, it's all nonsense.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that in Trump's lexicon \"bad\" and \"fake\" mean the same thing. He operates under the belief that the news is \"true\" when it is good for him. Which, obviously, doesn't make sense.\n\n17. \"So when you tell me I'm at 48 -- like Rasmussen, I was at 50 in Rasmussen -- when you tell me I'm at 50 percent, I say how can I possibly be at 50 percent?\"\n\nThe simple answer is he's not. His average approval is 43.1%, according to Real Clear Politics\n\n18. \"I have people that I love and that love me, frankly, that includes a lot of women. I've got a tremendous percentage of women last time, remember?\"\n\nTrump received 41% of the female vote in 2016, according to exit polling\n\n19. \"I got women that -- they're the greatest, and I have tremendous women support, but if you remember the last election I was worried I wouldn't get one women in the United States to run -- and I got tremendous -- I mean Hillary wishes she had my numbers, OK.\"\n\nHillary Clinton won 54% of the female vote in 2016.\n\n20. \"Look I've done a good job on the economy, but I've done a very good job in foreign relations.\"\n\nSo, economy \"good.\" But foreign relations \"very good.\" Got it?\n\n21. \"Nobody's done what I've done, and what this administration has done in the first two years, and we're not even that close to two years.\"\n\nTrump says this ALL THE TIME. It's impossible to quantify what he means by having \"done\" the most. But by virtually any measure you choose, Trump's claim is false\n\n22. \"They're going to open the whole country, that they want to please President Trump.\"\n\nNo one -- and I mean NO ONE -- goes third person like Donald John Trump.\n\n23. \"Well, I don't think there is any pressure. Everyone's doing so well. I mean there's not a lot of pressure.\"\n\nThe President of the United States says that he feels no pressure on the economy because \"everyone's doing so well.\" That quote is about the 50th most newsy/odd thing Trump said in this interview but, in any other administration with any other President, that sort of statement would be front-page news.\n\n24. \" I mean, I am doing great trade deals.\"\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na) Trump on Trump's handling of the economy: \"Good\"\n\nb) Trump on Trump's foreign policy: \"Very good\"\n\nc) Trump on Trump's trade deals: \"Great\"\n\n25. \"We have great strength. Nobody's ever done what I've done. \"\n\nTrump specializes in these sorts of claims -- totally impossible to prove. Nobody has ever done what he's done in terms of what? Everything?\n\n26. \"But I will tell you this, China's economy, if it's in trouble, it's only in trouble because of me.\"\n\nTrump doesn't know if China's economy is in trouble. But he is willing to take credit for China's economy being in trouble -- if, that is, it is in trouble.\n\n27. \"All electric's not going to work. I don't run a car company, but all electric is not going to work.\"\n\nPaging Elon Musk....\n\n28. \"Well, I'm focusing on everything.\"\n\nSame.\n\n29. \"You know what, I like to say I work hard, but hopefully I work smart, because I know a lot of people, they work -- you have to work smart too, and we're doing great.\"\n\nShorter Trump: I work both very hard and very smart. Hardsmart. Smarthard. This feels like a good place to end."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Melania Trump's poll numbers plummet", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/u0Vdpil3T4o/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Melania Trump's favorable rating has fallen by double-digits, according to a new CNN poll .

However, unlike the numbers of her husband, who has steadily maintained a favorable rating of about 40%, public opinion of the first lady has varied.\n\nMelania Trump's popularity peaked in early May of this year at 57%, following her first official State Dinner in late April, a public coming-out of sorts for the extremely private first lady. It was also on the heels of Trump's solo trip to Houston, Texas, to attend the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush, where she posed, smiling, for a photograph with living former presidents and first ladies, many of whom have icy relationships with her husband.\n\nA June survey, taken weeks after the announcement of her \"Be Best\" initiative and her subsequent hospitalization for a kidney procedure, which kept her out of the public eye for almost three weeks, Trump maintained strong favorable ratings at 51%.\n\nThis most recent poll is still 13 points higher than the first lady's lowest polling numbers, which occurred in January 2017, days prior to her husband's inauguration; at that time, her favorability stood at 36%, her unfavorable at 35% -- 23% had no opinion of her at all.\n\nThese new numbers reflect Trump maintains her strongest support from older, white, male Republicans and conservatives, while her biggest detractors are women, mainly younger and those who are college-educated.\n\nWhile the drop occurs across the board, it is bigger among the President's detractors. She is down 6 points among those who approve of the job her husband is doing as President, yet she's down 11 percentage points among those who disapprove. She has lost five points among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, but 13 points among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nThe biggest decrease for Melania Trump is among liberals and white college-graduates -- down 17 percentage points each.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has been more visible, often appearing side-by-side with the President at events, as well as accompanying him during travel to Argentina for the G20 Summit. The first lady has also been more vocal about policy issues, making longer, more detailed speeches on the opioid epidemic.\n\nBut she was also criticized after an October ABC News interview when she said women who accuse men of sexual misconduct must have \"hard evidence.\" She did say she supports women who say they have experienced sexual abuse.\n\nShe also made headlines for claiming: \"I could say that I'm the most bullied person in the world.\"\n\nMelania Trump weighed in on immigration during the interview, as well, saying she was \"blindsided\" by the administration policy separating children from their families at the border.\n\nThe poll was conducted for CNN via telephone by SSRS, an independent research company.

Trump, for what it's worth, has repeatedly expressed ignorance about the payments to Daniels and McDougal as well as where the money came from. We know the money came from Trump and, according to federal prosecutors, he directed the entire hush money operation.\n\nPerhaps the most important thing that the AMI settlement does, however, is make clear that the payment and the coordination with the Trump campaign was, according to the SDNY release, done by AMI \"to suppress the woman's story so as to prevent it from influencing the election.\"\n\nThat's of critical import, because Trump's latest argument is that while Daniels and McDougal were clearly paid off -- remember that he has long denied that -- it had nothing to do with his campaign or his prospects of winning. \"So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution, which it was not,\" he tweeted on Monday\n\nBut AMI is admitting in their settlement deal that the goal of catching and killing McDougal's story was \"to prevent it from influencing the election.\" Which means that the $150,000 amounted to an in-kind contribution to the campaign -- and broke campaign finance law.\n\nTrump's problems as a result of the AMI deal don't stop there.\n\nWhy? Because of this line in the SDNY release (again, bolding is mine):\n\n\"The agreement also acknowledges, among other things, AMI's acceptance of responsibility, its substantial and important assistance in this investigation, and its agreement to provide cooperation in the future and implement specific improvements to its internal compliance to prevent future violations of the federal campaign finance laws.\"\n\n\"Cooperation in the future\" is a very open-ended term. And a very fraught one if you are Donald Trump. It seems very unlikely that the catch-and-kill ploy that the Enquirer pulled with McDougal is the first and only time it ever did anything else like this with Trump. That's not to say there were lots and lots of women alleging affairs (we have no way of knowing at the moment) but it is to say that AMI -- and its head David Pecker, a longtime friend of the President -- may have helped bury other stories about Trump that were less than flattering.\n\nThere's now a very real chance that at least some of those stories may come out as a result of this cooperation agreement.

Since the 1930s , scientists have usled fetal tissue in the US, obtained through elective abortions in medical research and experimental therapies. And this research has been supported by the federal government since the 1950s.\n\nDuring the hearing, debate focused on the merits and value of two different types of humanized mice -- one requires fetal tissue, the other does not. Humanized mice, which possess human cells, DNA tissues or immune systems, are used in some biomedical research.\n\nAccording to the scientist whose humanized mouse research was debated between the two sides, some truth can be found on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWhat's the issue with human fetal tissue?\n\nIn September, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled a contract with a fetal tissue procurement company due to concerns that the company was not meeting regulations. Subsequently, HHS initiated an audit of human fetal tissue acquisitions and a review to understand whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\n\nHowever, those opposed to abortion have sought, for decades, to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue, while those in the research world support its use.\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report. The National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows.\n\nNot only has the federal government funded fetal tissue research for more than seven decades with procurement governed by an \"extensive regulatory framework,\" but fetal tissue research has a \"long history of support from both sides of the aisle,\" said Judy Chu, the Democratic representative from California who sits on the Steering and Policy Committee, during the hearing. Only today do pro-life \"extremists\" threaten the use of fetal tissue in research.\n\nOf the three scientists who presented testimony to the committee, Dr. Tara Sander Lee, a molecular and cell biologist and an associate scholar with the Charlotte Lozier Institute and Dr. David Prentice, an advisory board member for the Midwest Stem Cell Therapy Center argued that several ethical alternatives to human fetal tissue are currently available to researchers -- including donated human tissues, bone marrow as well as stem cells and their derivatives.\n\nDr. Sally Temple, a board member and former president with the International Society for Stem Cell Research , which promotes dissemination of ideas and information related to stem cells, said \"the alternatives mentioned may be useful at times but cannot fully replace fetal tissue.\" She noted that fetal tissue, being at a different developmental stage, has \"unique properties\" that donated neonatal tissue lacks and therefore \"the consensus of our field\" is that fetal tissue is \"essential\" for biomedical research.\n\nDiscussion landed on humanized mice when Temple argued that the humanized mouse model created using human fetal tissue, has made advances in HIV research possible. Lee and Prentice said a new humanized mouse model created using non-fetal human tissue sources might serve as an adequate substitute.\n\nNot so fast, said Matt Brown, an assistant scientist in the department of surgery at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, one of the creators of the new humanized mice created without fetal tissue. \"I'm caught in the middle of this,\" Brown told CNN after the hearing, which he did not participate in or attend.\n\nThough he's excited to develop an alternative humanized mouse model, he said more rigorous scientific testing is needed to understand the types of research it can be used for and its value. So it's too early to suggest his alternative model could replace the fetal tissue model, he said, though he speculates his humanized mouse could be better, in some cases, than the current standard.\n\n\"It's a very nuanced discussion,\" said Brown. \"If they go ahead and ban this -- you know black and white, let's ban it all -- there will be so many unintended side effects,\" said Brown. \"They could do so much damage if they ban this the wrong way; it could set science back years and hurt patients, too.\"\n\nAt the same time, he believes scientists \"should listen to people's concerns -- people feel very strongly about [human fetal tissue]. And no scientist wants to use this unless they have to [based on the science],\" he said. \"Scientists should pursue alternatives when they are available.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe hearing drew stark lines in the sand between the two sides, yet middle ground does exist, as suggested by a close listen to arguments. For example, Temple admitted some research that previously relied on fetal tissue is now done in alternative ways, while Prentice noted that the funding of historic cell lines originally derived from aborted fetuses is not in question. And, seemingly thinking aloud, Mark Meadows, the Republican representative from North Carolina who chaired the hearing, suggested the possibility of continued federal funding to support ongoing fetal tissue research, with new projects funded only if they used alternatives.\n\nIn a statement to the committees, Brown expressed modest hopes. He simply wished for a \"constructive dialogue\" regarding scientists' need to access tissue, including fetal tissue, to advance the \"cutting edge research we are undertaking with the goal of alleviating patient suffering worldwide.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Chain restaurants are less healthy than fast food, global study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/V6mZto7rmAY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Fast food often gets the blame for calorific meals, but new research has found that your favorite chain restaurants are dishing up meals with even more excessive calories, worsening the global obesity epidemic.\n\nOverly large portions and food laden with sugar and fats are regularly being served in sit-down eateries, as well as fast food outlets, according to two studies published in the BMJ on Wednesday.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the problem -- which experts say is fueling obesity, pushing up rates of diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses -- is also not confined to the United States, the studies say.\n\nAlthough the poor nutritional content of fast food has been well-documented, there has been less research into the energy content of more traditional \"full-service\" or sit-down restaurants.\n\nOne UK study analyzed the calories in 13,500 main meals served in 27 UK restaurant chains, of which 21 were full-service restaurants and the remainder serving fast food. A US study measured calories in the most frequently ordered meals in 116 restaurants across five countries -- Brazil, China, Finland, Ghana and India -- comparing them against the United States.\n\nThe calorie content of the most popular meals in British and international restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations, the researchers found. In the global study, only China was found to serve \"significantly less energy than restaurants in the US.\"\n\nFast food, it concluded, contained on average 33% fewer calories than more formal restaurant meals.\n\nThe UK's health agency, Public Health England, recommended that lunches and evening meals should not exceed 600 calories (also measured as kcal). But almost none of the restaurants surveyed reflected this.\n\n\"We found that the number of calories in the average restaurant meal was more than the number of calories in the average fast food meal,\" said Eric Robinson, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, who led the UK study. \"A lot of people would expect there to be more calories in fast food, but our findings were counter to that.\"\n\n'Fast food comes out as the good guy'\n\nThe average main meal dish at a fast food chain in the UK contained 751 calories, compared with an average of 1,033 at sit-down restaurants. Only 11% of full-service dishes served at the 21 restaurants studied -- including Pizza Express, Zizzi and Wagamama -- met the recommended limit of 600 calories, though that rose to 17% in fast food meals.\n\nThese restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe worst-performing of the British fast food outlets, KFC, had an average of 987 calories per meal, but it fared better than more than half of the sit-down restaurants. Meanwhile, an average meal at Burger King (711 calories) proved less calorific than every one of the traditional restaurants surveyed.\n\nThe worst offenders were named as Hungry Horse, where the average meal contained 1,358 calories, followed by Sizzling Pubs (1,269 calories) and Flaming Grill Pubs (1,232 calories).\n\nSizzling Pubs' parent company, Mitchells and Butlers, said in a statement, \"We share nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests make knowledgeable decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us.\n\n\"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.\"\n\nThe other restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe international study, which didn't name specific restaurants, found an average of 809 calories in main meal dishes served by fast food chains and 1,317 calories in restaurant chains. Only the Chinese served fewer calories than Americans: 1,045 calories in full-service, compared with 1,362 in US eateries, and 561 in fast food restaurants, as opposed to 969 in America. Indian meals tended to be higher in calories; restaurants in the remaining countries were comparable to those in the United States.\n\nOnce again, a small minority of meals met the 600-calorie recommendation, with 94% of full-service dishes and 72% of fast food dishes exceeding this limit.\n\nRobinson said that although there is considerable debate in Britain about forcing restaurants to display calorie content, only 9% of the meals his research covered met the maximum.\n\n\"So even if you want to know about calories on the menu, you are not left with many meals to choose from,\" he said. \"Restaurants need to serve fewer calories. There are a lot of meals that have far too many calories, whether it's due to portion sizes, ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n\"The bigger issue it relates to is that we are living in a food environment that encourages and causes people to eat more calories than they need,\" he said. \"If a government is serious about trying to reduce obesity and the number of people who die young because of poor diet and obesity, then the food environment is something that needs to be addressed and tackled.\"\n\nSusan Roberts, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, was the lead author of the international study. \"Until now, fast food has been criticized all the time, but in this study, fast food comes out as the good guy,\" she said. \"It was still bad, but it had 33% less calories than standard restaurants.\"\n\nPotential steps to be taken include reducing portion sizes or even introducing proportional prices for restaurant meals, Roberts said. In other words, people would be required to pay for the portions they ordered rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"I think that most of us would be delighted to be able to go into a restaurant and order the size that we actually want. But that would mean that restaurants would have to actually recognize that they are part of the problem, which I think they will deny,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe authors of both reports said no firm conclusions could be drawn, as both were observational. However, they also warned that their findings may not fully reflect the reality, as they did not take in to account drinks, appetizers, desserts or side orders.\n\n'Step up and take responsibility'\n\nCaroline Cerny, lead of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 British organizations and charities, noted that \"regularly eating excess calories over time leads to weight gain.\"\n\n\"Children these days are growing up in an obesogenic environment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to make healthy choices. That's why we welcome government proposals to introduce mandatory calorie labeling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaway. But we also need the whole food industry, including restaurants, to step up and take responsibility for making healthier eating easier, by reducing calories and sugar in their meals by 20% in line with government targets.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTam Fry, chairman of the UK's National Obesity Forum, welcomed the findings but said he thought Public Health England's 600-calorie recommendation was \"unrealistic\".\n\n\"We have all become so accustomed to eating so much more now that I think a more realistic maximum would be about 800 calories,\" he said. \"The restaurant industry has got to clean up its act, but I fear it won't do it voluntarily because they feel they will lose custom.

Hoffer answered, and he heard: \"This is the State Department. We have a problem.\"\n\nHoffer was told that an individual in Havana was hearing odd noises, experiencing pain and ringing in the ear, and feeling dizzy and confused.\n\nThat person, and others with similar symptoms, were United States diplomatic personnel living in Cuba -- and the cause of their symptoms remains a medical mystery.\n\nIn August 2017, State Department officials said the cause may have been a possible \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices. Cuba officials have arduously denied such an attack.\n\nHoffer, a professor of otolaryngology and neurological surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida, examined some of those personnel along with his colleagues.\n\nNow Hoffer and his colleagues -- from the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh -- are revealing new details on those symptoms seen among the 25 diplomats in a study, published in the journal Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology on Wednesday.\n\nIn this retrospective study, the researchers described their findings as \"the first report of the acute symptoms in this patient group.\"\n\nA separate study, previously published in the medical journal JAMA in March, described the symptoms of 21 personnel who sought medical attention and found that a majority of them reported problems with memory, concentration, balance, eyesight, hearing, sleeping or headaches that lasted more than three months. Three people eventually needed hearing aids for moderate to severe hearing loss, and others had ringing or pressure in their ears according to that report.\n\nBeginning in 2016 and throughout last year, several diplomats and their family members stationed in Havana reported hearing bizarre noises and experiencing a range of symptoms, such as dizziness, ear pain, and ringing in the ears.\n\nWhen it comes to exactly what they were suffering from, \"what caused it, who did it, why it was done, we don't know any of those things,\" Hoffer said during a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe US State Department and federal investigators have been unable to definitively attribute the source or cause of these symptoms, but in August last year, several department officials told CNN they might have been the result of an \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices.\n\nCuban officials have strenuously denied that there were any targeted attacks on diplomats in Havana and said their symptoms could have been caused by other factors.\n\n\"All has been speculation or manipulated information,\" Cuba's Director General for US Affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Wednesday about the US investigation into the health incidents.\n\n\"The concrete questions have not been asked.

Why is it not capable of putting forward concrete, real information that the scientific community can accept?\"\n\nThe study released Wednesday details symptoms experienced by 15 men and 10 women.\n\nThey all reported being exposed to either some strange noise or pressure and then immediately after that exposure, the majority felt intense ear pain and ringing, according to the study. They all then noticed cognitive symptoms, including feeling disoriented.\n\nThe study noted that some of the findings may seem similar to symptoms of a \"mild traumatic brain injury following blast exposure or blunt trauma.\"\n\n\"It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing an inner ear disturbance or demonstrate findings suggestive of an mTBI,\" or mild traumatic brain injury, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nYet the injury pattern seen among these patients had some differences from the typical symptoms seen with a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, the researchers noted.\n\n\"In addition, the low incidence of headaches (around 25%) is unusual, as many studies of mTBI show that headache is one of the most common and persistent symptoms,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nSince the exposure responsible for the study's findings remains unknown, the researchers wrote, they could not \"exclude any potential directed or non\u2010directed energy sources at this time.\"\n\nDirected energy sources would be some form of energy pointed or focused directly on an object or a person, Carey Balaban, a professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh and one of the authors of the study, said in the news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"The energy may be acoustic, pressure waves, you've probably heard of LRAD devices (or long-range acoustic devices) -- devices they've discussed in the press -- so ultrasound is one mode that could be used for this. We also could have radiofrequency. We could have microwave. We could have light -- lasers are an example of it.

Some countries have used a \"mosquito\" -- which produces a very high-pitched sound that can be perceived by teenagers but not adults -- to prevent teens from loitering.\n\n\"I know of no acoustic effect that would produce concussion-like symptoms; according to my research, strong effects on humans require loudness levels that would be perceived as very loud noise while exposed,\" J\u00fcrgen Altmann, a physics professor at Technischen Universit\u00e4t Dortmund in Berlin, told CNN in May\n\nLimitations of the new study include that a small number of patients with symptoms were evaluated and uncertainty remains around the true cause of the symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"The way we view this is that it's an area for active research,\" Balaban said.\n\n\"I'm currently doing some research sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, where we're looking at using computer simulation and a variety of physical and biological models to just get an idea of what are likely possibilities,\" he said. \"We're not ready to rule anything out yet but we're ready to find evidence so that we can rule things out.

Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMrs May urged EU leaders to work with her to \"change the perception\" of the controversial backstop plan.\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said the withdrawal agreement was \"not open for renegotiation\".\n\nBut speaking after the Brussels summit, Mr Tusk called the backstop \"an insurance policy,\" saying it was the EU's \"firm determination\" to work \"speedily\" on alternative arrangements.\n\nMr Tusk said the backstop would \"apply temporarily unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that the hard border is avoided\".\n\nImage caption Mrs May told EU leaders she firmly believed the deal could get through the Commons\n\nMr Juncker also urged the UK to tell the EU what it wants from a future relationship.\n\n\"Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want, and so we would like within a few weeks our UK friends to set out their expectations for us, because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications,\" he said.\n\nThe European Council's conclusions on Brexit - published on Thursday evening - say the EU would use its \"best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop, and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary\".\n\nIn other words, the EU would continue trying to negotiate a trade deal with the UK even if the Irish backstop had been triggered at the end of the transition period.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming\n\nThe words that diplomats were using about Theresa May's performance were \"bad\" and \"vague\".\n\nHowever, she did get something.\n\nShe got a recommitment from the EU that they want a close future relationship and will work quickly to get that.\n\nThere was also a recommitment that the backstop was temporary.\n\nThe fact the EU said it would use its best endeavours to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials.\n\nThey say it means the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they feel the EU is dragging its feet.\n\nThat was a win for them.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who holds the rotating EU presidency, suggested there could be a special Brexit summit in January to agree \"additional assurances\".\n\nBut Irish premier Leo Varadkar said that while the EU was keen to be \"helpful\", some of the suggestions Mrs May had put forward were \"difficult\", and he warned there could be no \"unilateral exit clause\" on the backstop.\n\nDowning Street has confirmed MPs will not now vote on Mrs May's deal before Christmas, and said the vote would happen \"as soon as possible in January\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Strasbourg Christmas market attacker Chekatt shot dead", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46561574", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption French special forces secure the area where Chekatt was shot\n\nFrench police have shot dead the man who attacked Strasbourg's Christmas market on Tuesday, the interior minister has said.\n\nA police unit came across Cherif Chekatt in a Strasbourg street and shot him after he opened fire.\n\nThree people have died following the shooting at the market and several more were seriously injured.\n\nChekatt, 29, had a string of criminal convictions in France and Germany and had become a radical Islamist in jail.\n\nHow was Chekatt found?\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said three police officers had spotted a man matching Chekatt's description on rue du Lazaret, in the Neudorf area of Strasbourg at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT).\n\nAs the police moved to stop him, the suspect turned round and opened fire.

Two more families have told the BBC of their concerns with the service after their sons had the same \"extreme\" treatment without their knowledge.\n\nIn both cases, they were expecting their sons, who have learning disabilities, to have a small number of teeth removed but were left shocked when they emerged from the operating theatre with no teeth left.\n\nWorcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, which runs the dental service, insisted it followed the correct procedures for vulnerable patients, while three clinical commissioning groups are investigating Ms Johnston's death.\n\nCampaigners have said they are often told of poor communication between disabled patients and their families, and that dentists should intervene earlier to avoid taking out every tooth in a person's mouth.\n\n\"There should never be a situation where such extreme treatment comes as a surprise,\" said Sarah Coleman, from Mencap.\n\nWhat happened to Rachel Johnston?\n\nImage copyright Diana Johnston Image caption Diana Johnston says she wants to know why her daughter Rachel died\n\nA passion for singing 1980s pop star Shakin' Stevens and the computer-animated film Ice Age helped make Ms Johnston, 49, the life and soul of Pirton Grange Care Home.\n\nBut a lifetime of dental problems meant the Johnston family were told earlier this year a \"full dental clearance\" - the removal of all her teeth - may be needed.\n\n\"I asked if they could take a few out at a time - it seemed like a big operation - but was told they only wanted to put her under the general anaesthetic once,\" said her mother Diana Johnston, from Evesham.\n\nOn 26 October, her daughter, who suffered brain damage after contracting meningitis as a baby, was anaesthetised at Kidderminster Hospital for the removal of all her teeth.\n\nMs Johnston's temperature dropped during the procedure but after coming round she was in high spirits, her mother said, and was discharged four hours later.\n\nThe following day, care home staff phoned her mother to say she was very unwell.\n\n\"She was bleeding quite a bit and her tongue had swollen right up. But she was just lying there. It was like there was no life.\"\n\nThe following day she was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties.\n\nHer daughter was put on a life support machine but her family was eventually told there was nothing more doctors could do for her.\n\nShe died on 13 November, 10 days after the machine was turned off. A coroner is investigating.\n\n\"She was so strong - she contracted meningitis at six weeks old and doctors said if she makes it to 10 you'll have the biggest bonus,\" said Mrs Johnston.\n\n\"Well she got 39 more years. She fought everything that was thrown at her, which makes what happened even more difficult.\"\n\nWhat concerns do other families have?\n\nImage copyright Kerry Ashmore Image caption Nora Ashmore says she was shocked to find her son Kelvin had had all his teeth taken out\n\nNora Ashmore's son Kelvin had suffered tooth decay after years of problems brushing his teeth.\n\n\"He'd bite down on the toothbrush, it was very difficult,\" said Mrs Ashmore.\n\nThree years ago, aged 32, he had to go to Worcestershire Royal Hospital to have some decayed teeth removed.\n\n\"I had to sign a form for them to do what was necessary,\" his mother recalled.\n\n\"When he went into recovery, there was a lot of blood [around his mouth]. I thought it seemed a lot for a few teeth.\"\n\nMrs Ashmore said a man and woman then told her all her son's teeth had been taken out.\n\n\"I said 'pardon?' I couldn't believe what they were saying. I was so shocked.\"\n\nMrs Ashmore said she felt the procedure was \"so radical, so drastic\".\n\n\"If they'd have said beforehand 'we think this is the best way forward', I might have understood.\n\n\"It's something we've tried to forget. You think 'they must know best'.\"\n\nIt is a situation familiar to Debbie and Jon Perry. Their son, in his 30s, also had all his teeth taken out by the trust around the same time as Kelvin.\n\nThey said they were expecting him to have a deep clean, some fillings and a few extractions.\n\n\"We signed some documents but they didn't tell us they were going to take all his teeth,\" said Mrs Perry.\n\n\"We were very shocked,\" her husband added. \"He was very distressed. He was looking at us, like, 'what have they done?'\"\n\n\"It's affected him a lot. He's got no confidence now, doesn't want to go out on days out, holidays, anything,\" said Mrs Perry.\n\nWhy are people with learning disabilities prone to tooth decay?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThere are many reasons, including behavioural problems that affect teeth brushing, gastric reflux, and some chromosomal disorders.\n\nThe NHS runs community dental services around the UK to look after people who find going to the dentist difficult.\n\nDentists must obtain informed consent before carrying out treatment but some patients do not have the mental capacity to do this.\n\nA dentist will assess the patient's capacity in line with principles set out in the Mental Capacity Act (England) 2005, said Charlotte Waite, who chairs the British Dental Association's England Community Dental Services Committee.\n\n\"Where patients do not have this capacity, the dentist may provide treatment in the patient's best interest,\" she said.\n\n\"The legislation states that dentists should provide treatment that is the 'least restrictive of the patient's rights and freedom of action'.\"\n\nIt is not always possible to complete a full examination of a patient's teeth before they undergo anaesthetic.\n\n\"In those cases, the dentist should usually discuss the potential possibilities with all the appropriate people involved in making a decision that's in the best interest of the patient,\" said Ms Waite.\n\nWhat does the health trust say?\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Rachel Johnston was put under anaesthetic at Kidderminster Hospital\n\nDecisions sometimes have to be made in the treatment room because dentists do not want to pause a procedure while a patient is under anaesthetic, a spokesman for Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust said.\n\nDentists do not want to risk patients being anaesthetised several times, so in some cases decide to remove non-restorable teeth to avoid this, said Rod Smith, Associate Medical Director for Specialist Primary Care.\n\n\"The consent process is clear that fillings would be done if the teeth are restorable, with extractions carried out if not, and that ultimately the aim is to render the patient dentally fit at the end of the procedure,\" he added.\n\n\"The feedback we receive across our community dental service is very positive but we will always listen to patients and families to see if there is more we can do to ensure their experience is a positive one.\"\n\nIn the case of Ms Johnston's death, a spokesperson for the three Worcestershire CCGs said: \"Whilst it would not be appropriate for us to discuss the details of any specific case, we can confirm that all relevant agencies are committed to work together to share the facts and review the circumstances leading up to a recent case of the death of a person with a learning disability.\"\n\nWhat do organisations that help people with learning disabilities think?\n\n\"Sadly, it is very common for there to be a lack of communication between healthcare professionals and people with a learning disability and their families,\" Sarah Coleman, Mencap's health policy officer, said.\n\n\"More must be done to ensure people with a learning disability can access good quality dental care as soon as they need it, before we reach the point where multiple teeth need to be extracted.\n\n\"People with a learning disability deserve the same quality of treatment and care as anyone else, and it's simply not good enough when they don't get it.\n\n\"Making a best interest decision on a matter such as whether to give a general anaesthetic, or to remove teeth, is extremely serious and requires careful consideration.\"\n\nHave you or anyone in your family had a similar experience?

At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions.\n\nHowever some progress is being seen in shaping the rules.\n\n\"Some of the text that are key to the rulebook, in terms of the transparency of countries reporting their mitigating actions are pretty strong, they are better than they were a week ago,\" said one senior negotiator.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nBut there are significant holdups.\n\nPoorer countries want some \"flexibility\" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice.\n\n\"The rulebook right now hangs in the balance, because you need all countries on board and you need to support developing countries,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it, when you don't have a clear signal from developed countries that they are going to provide that support it just brings a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\nAs well as the rulebook, what else needs to be decided?\n\nThere's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this year produced a critical report on how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century.\n\nThe decision to welcome this report was rejected amid controversy earlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report.\n\nWhen consensus couldn't be found the text about the IPCC was dropped much to the surprise of a majority of countries. There is a determination here to ensure that at the end of this meeting a \"COP decision\" will recognise the IPCC.\n\n\"There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,\" said Mohamed Nasheed.\n\n\"We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage.\"\n\nWhat about cutting carbon faster?\n\nThere is a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency.\n\nIn the light of the IPPC report many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive.\n\nRight now the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as \"grossly insufficient\" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country.\n\nIt is not just the negotiators and ministers here who want to see progress on cutting carbon. Business is looking for a signal from this meeting about the future.\n\n\"Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,\" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola.\n\n\"So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster.\"\n\nWho's really in charge of these negotiations?\n\nPoland holds the COP presidency but there is a lot of concern among delegates that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting.\n\nMost people want to see a strong rulebook, a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive.\n\nWhile some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich and not the poor.\n\n\"I think the presidency is too honed in with the what the high emitting countries are looking for right now and that could lead to a weak outcome here,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Often in these talks when it's quite complex, and you don't have clear leadership, that's when countries like Saudi Arabia can come in and just wreak havoc. That's why we need the ministers from EU to come and work with poor nations to drive that home to counterbalance what the Saudis and the Poles are doing here.\"\n\nWhen will it all end?\n\nFor the more than 20,000 people attending these talks, the end can't come quick enough.\n\nMost have been here for around two weeks. Officially, it is all due to finish on Friday evening. But the expectation is that it will be Saturday at the earliest.\n\nSome are worried that it could go into Sunday, but most delegates have flights to catch on that date so the pressure will be on to finish by then.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Southwest Airlines flight U-turns after human heart discovery", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46562494", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:22", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours\n\nA US passenger plane travelling from Seattle to Dallas was forced to turn back hours into its flight because a human heart had been left on board.\n\nSouthwest Airlines says the organ was flown to Seattle from California, where it was to be processed at a hospital to have a valve recovered for future use.\n\nBut it was never unloaded and its absence was not noticed until the plane was almost half-way to Dallas.\n\nThe heart itself had not been intended for a specific patient.\n\nDetails of the incident, which occurred on Sunday, were revealed in media reports on Thursday.\n\nPassengers were said to have been shocked when the captain told them about the cargo and why the flight was turning back.\n\nSome used their smartphones to investigate the length of time that a heart can be stored before it is no longer viable for a transplant operation - typically between four and six hours, according to experts.\n\nThe plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours.\n\nA doctor who was among the passengers but not involved in the shipment of the organ, told the Seattle Times newspaper that the incident was a \"horrific story of gross negligence\".\n\nFollowing the flight's return to Seattle, the heart was taken to a donor health centre for tissue storage and was said to have been received within the required time frame, the newspaper added."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Irish parliament approves abortion bill", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46558431", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:24", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Republic of Ireland voted to overturn its abortion ban in a referendum in May\n\nA bill to legalise abortion services in the Republic of Ireland has passed all stages of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament).\n\nOn Thursday evening the report and final stages of the bill passed in the Seanad (Irish Senate), reports Irish Broadcaster RT\u00c9.\n\nThe Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill will now be given to the President to be signed into law.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland overturned its abortion ban in a referendum in May.\n\nThe Seanad spent nine hours debating the bill on Thursday.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @SimonHarrisTD Just over 200 days ago, you, the people of Ireland voted to repeal the 8th so we could care for women with compassion.

At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions.\n\nHowever some progress is being seen in shaping the rules.\n\n\"Some of the text that are key to the rulebook, in terms of the transparency of countries reporting their mitigating actions are pretty strong, they are better than they were a week ago,\" said one senior negotiator.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nBut there are significant holdups.\n\nPoorer countries want some \"flexibility\" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice.\n\n\"The rulebook right now hangs in the balance, because you need all countries on board and you need to support developing countries,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it, when you don't have a clear signal from developed countries that they are going to provide that support it just brings a lot of uncertainty.\"\n\nAs well as the rulebook, what else needs to be decided?\n\nThere's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this year produced a critical report on how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century.\n\nThe decision to welcome this report was rejected amid controversy earlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report.\n\nWhen consensus couldn't be found the text about the IPCC was dropped much to the surprise of a majority of countries. There is a determination here to ensure that at the end of this meeting a \"COP decision\" will recognise the IPCC.\n\n\"There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,\" said Mohamed Nasheed.\n\n\"We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage.\"\n\nWhat about cutting carbon faster?\n\nThere is a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency.\n\nIn the light of the IPPC report many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive.\n\nRight now the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as \"grossly insufficient\" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country.\n\nIt is not just the negotiators and ministers here who want to see progress on cutting carbon. Business is looking for a signal from this meeting about the future.\n\n\"Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,\" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola.\n\n\"So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster.\"\n\nWho's really in charge of these negotiations?\n\nPoland holds the COP presidency but there is a lot of concern among delegates that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting.\n\nMost people want to see a strong rulebook, a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive.\n\nWhile some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich and not the poor.\n\n\"I think the presidency is too honed in with the what the high emitting countries are looking for right now and that could lead to a weak outcome here,\" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace.\n\n\"Often in these talks when it's quite complex, and you don't have clear leadership, that's when countries like Saudi Arabia can come in and just wreak havoc. That's why we need the ministers from EU to come and work with poor nations to drive that home to counterbalance what the Saudis and the Poles are doing here.\"\n\nWhen will it all end?\n\nFor the more than 20,000 people attending these talks, the end can't come quick enough.\n\nMost have been here for around two weeks. Officially, it is all due to finish on Friday evening. But the expectation is that it will be Saturday at the earliest.\n\nSome are worried that it could go into Sunday, but most delegates have flights to catch on that date so the pressure will be on to finish by then.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's Jupiter mission Juno reveals giant polar storms", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46547904", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:00:55", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA / SwRI / MSSS / Gerald Eichst\u00e4dt / Se\u00e1n Doran Image caption People have downloaded the raw images of Jupiter and processed them, often revealing new details of its surface\n\nNasa's Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter has reached its halfway mark and has revealed new views of cyclones at the poles.\n\nAs it orbits the planet every 53 days - Juno performs a science-gathering dive, speeding from pole to pole.\n\nIts sensors take measurements of the composition of the planet, in an effort to decipher how the largest world in our Solar System formed.\n\nMapping the magnetic and gravity fields should also expose Jupiter's structure.\n\nImage copyright NASA/SwRI/MSSS/Roman Tkachenko Image caption JunoCam has seen giant cyclones at the poles\n\nBut images from JunoCam - a camera that was intended to capture images that could be shared with the public - has already given us some surprising insights.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A video made of 21 images gives a spectacular view of a Juno 'dive'\n\nDr Candice Hansen, from the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, is leading the JunoCam project, which she described as \"our little outreach camera\".

They jumped on to a bus which took them from a refugee camp in Beirut to the south of Lebanon, on the border with Israel.\n\nThere, they hurled stones at the Israeli soldiers, even though they could hardly see their targets and most probably failed to hit any. It was an act of defiance, learned from TV.\n\n\"It is beautiful in Palestine, greenery everywhere,\" one of them said. Mustafa is a fourth generation Palestinian refugee. \"There are olive trees. It's like paradise.\"\n\nIn his reminiscences, he throws together his brief impressions of that day with what he has heard from the elders in his family. \"Inshallah! One day we will return.\"\n\nIf that wish was ever achievable, it today seems further away than ever.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on September 26 he would reveal his grand peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \"in the next two to three to four months\" - and was seemingly taking the Palestinian right of return off the table.\n\nThis week marks the 70th anniversary of the UN's Resolution 194, granting Palestinians the right of return, one of the three issues integral to the Middle East peace process.\n\nThe logic in the Trump government seems to be in sync with Israel's; only those born in historic Palestine would reportedly be counted as refugees - not their descendants.\n\nThe Trump team is therefore expected to cap the number of Palestinian refugees at half a million - about a tenth of 5.5 million registered with the UN.\n\nThat would likely deprive Mustafa, and millions like him, of the promise of Palestine.\n\nMustafa lives in south Beirut's Bourj el-Barajneh camp, built for 500 families in 1948, now packed with 50,000 refugees.\n\nBarely 16, he was listlessly puffing out rings of smoke in the corner of a street that was littered with foul-smelling garbage. A mass of matted electric wires hung above him.\n\nLebanon has always reminded its Palestinian refugees that they will never be accepted as citizens. Lebanese politicians fear that granting citizenship and voting rights to Palestinians, almost all Sunni Muslim, will alter the country's delicate demographic balance.\n\n180514072817433\n\nIn a daily reminder that Palestinians are not welcome in Lebanon, they are legally banned from 30 vocations, all well paying jobs that could enable them to raise their status and pull themselves out of poverty.\n\nThe alternative being offered by President Trump's team is to offer the Palestinians residency, if not citizenship, in their host states.\n\nThat seems unlikely to find favour with either the Palestinians, who would still be left stateless, or host governments. In Lebanon, additionally, Hezbollah is in a position to enforce its view that the goal should be retaking Palestine, not making the status quo more palatable.\n\nIf not Lebanon, what about Europe?\n\nNot far away, Khalil, 21, spends his day skirting the armed young men who populate the camp. Anyone who doesn't have work, he said, joins the Palestinian armed factions that control camp security - most of the young men. Mostly, he says, they do it to get their hands on a weapon.\n\n\"They fire at will, wherever, whenever they like,\" he said.\n\nKhalil is soft-spoken and ambitious, uninterested in violence. He is catering to the customers at his father's general store, waiting for his luck to kick in.\n\nHe wants to study accountancy at a good university. That can be achieved in Europe, he thinks. He is asking himself whether he would accept resettlement in Europe instead of the right to return if the Trump deal offered it.\n\nThat's not a thought that has crossed Mustafa's mind. He dropped out of school, feeling that however hard he studied he would never have a career. Khalil, on the other hand, has at least theoretical options.\n\nThis does not mean he is prepared to abandon his identity, he says. He will not give up on the right to return - as a principle. \"It is our homeland, my homeland. Wherever I work, my country is still my country,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said if he had a decent life in Europe, that is a right he could choose not to exercise.\n\nOf course, this remains theoretical. Europe at present is in no hurry to hand out residence or citizenship to another group of refugees, already reeling under the impact of the Syrian crisis.\n\nPalestinian by origin, Lebanese by birth\n\nBy contrast, Nadia Rdeini loves Lebanon. Moreover, she is skeptical about whether she would have as good a future - or even a future at all - in an independent Palestine.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera in a smart cafe in Christian East Beirut's most fashionable restaurant street, she arrived in a pink chiffon headscarf, saying: \"I was born here and I want to live here.

She would much prefer to stay in Lebanon. As such, she does not care about a right to return - but would like the right to visit.\n\nShe represents a third way, albeit a minority one for Palestinians, perhaps akin to the Hong Kong residents who were given British passports on the former colony's return to China in 1997 - without the right to live in Britain.\n\nRoom for compromise?\n\nThe message of all three of these young Palestinians was that they were not willing to trade their national identity for a better quality of life - but they were nevertheless desperate for that better quality of life.\n\nThe question for the 5.5 million Palestinians about to be made stateless is whether any future available to them is compensation enough for the loss of a dream.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken of a 'State Minus' for Palestine, a demilitarised state with limited authority.\n\nMost Palestinians will not accept anything less than a fully independent state but some may be ready to discuss the right to return.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:09:52", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Senate Votes to End Backing for Saudi War Effort in Yemen", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-votes-to-end-backing-for-saudi-war-effort-in-yemen/4700409.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:09", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has dealt a historic rebuke to Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally, passing a resolution to end American support for the kingdom's military intervention in Yemen's civil war.

Then Saudi Arabia punished it for speaking up for human rights. Now China has the country in its crosshairs, detaining two Canadians in apparent retaliation for the arrest of a top Chinese tech executive on behalf of the United States.\n\nCanada is caught between two super powers and taking the punishment \u2014 and the United States has been conspicuously absent in coming to its aid\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been this alone,\u201d historian Robert Bothwell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any serious allies. And I think that\u2019s another factor in what the Chinese are doing. ... Our means of retaliation are very few. China is a hostile power.\u201d\n\nThe two Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat in China, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur who lived in northeastern China near the North Korean border, were taken into custody Monday on suspicion of \u201cengaging in activities that endanger the national security\u201d of China, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. Canadian consular officials have had no access to them.\n\nChinese pressure on Canada\n\nTheir detentions ratchet up pressure on Canada, which arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of telecommunications giant Huawei, on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she and her company misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran. A Canadian judge released Meng on bail Tuesday.\n\nThe case has set off a diplomatic furor among the three nations in which Canada has been stuck in the middle.\n\nUntil now, Canada had a largely good relationship with China, forged by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who helped establish the one-China formula that enabled many other countries to recognize China in the 1970s. Canada acknowledged there is one government of China and does not officially recognize Taiwan.\n\nChina has since become Canada\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after the United States. Chinese investment has powered real estate booms in Vancouver and Toronto. And one-third of foreign students in Canada are Chinese. Justin Trudeau has even talked about a possible free-trade agreement with China in a bid to diversify Canada\u2019s trade, which relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of its exports.\n\nFirst US, now China\n\nBut the Canadian prime minister has said little since news of this week\u2019s arrests became public. Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau isn\u2019t being forceful enough with the Chinese.\n\n\u201cThis situation demonstrates that Justin Trudeau\u2019s naive approach to relations with China isn\u2019t working,\u201d Scheer said.\n\nIt\u2019s Canada\u2019s second dispute with a major power this year. In June, Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn\u2019t be pushed around in talks to hammer out a new North American trade agreement, an unprecedented attack on America\u2019s closest ally. Trump called Trudeau weak and dishonest, words that shocked Canadians.\n\nThen Trump said this week that he might intervene in the Huawei case if it would help clinch a trade agreement with China, upending U.S. efforts to separate the court proceeding from U.S.-China trade talks and contradicting Canadian officials who said the arrest was not political.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland took a swipe at Trump, saying it was \u201cquite obvious\u201d any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure \u201cthe process is not politicized.\u201d\n\n\u200bNo support from US\n\n\u201cNormally, Canada can count on the United States to back them up on such an issue,\u201d said Laura Dawson, a former economic adviser at the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. Dawson said it\u2019s unusual for Washington to \u201cleave Canada hanging high and dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has made it clear that old alliances don\u2019t matter so much anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has made no secret of his preference for a go-it-alone approach and his lack of regard for traditional alliances.\u201d\n\nIn years past the U.S. might have defended Canada when came it under attack and other countries would know the U.S. had Canada\u2019s back. Not now. In August, the Saudi government expelled Canada\u2019s ambassador to the kingdom and withdrew its own ambassador after Canada\u2019s foreign ministry tweeted support for an arrested Saudi activist. The Saudis also sold Canadian investments and ordered their citizens studying in Canada to leave. No country, including the U.S., spoke out publicly in support of Canada.\n\nAnd now the stakes are much higher. Canada is one of the few countries in the world unabashedly speaking out in defense of human rights and the international rule of law. And Chinese trade with Canada is increasingly key as Canada looks to boost its exports in Asia as its trade with the U.S. is threatened by Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of Trump there was this idea that maybe the Chinese would replace the Americans\u201d as Canada\u2019s pre-eminent trade partner \u201cbut that\u2019s just nuts,\u201d said historian Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor. \u201cRelations for any smaller country with China are really grave.\u201d\n\nDerek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called China\u2019s actions toward Canada \u201cthuggish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou detain a Canadian because the Canadians can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s bullying behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting Canada was just following a routine extradition process with the United States, Scissors said America should be saying: \u201c\u2018Why are you picking up Canadians? You have a problem with us.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the US? Where\u2019s the West?\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said not only the U.S. but other Western nations should be standing up for Canada.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if publicly and also behind the scenes if countries like the United States, the U.K., Australia and France would put in a word on our behalf and let the Chinese know how damaging this is to their reputation and to the notion that China is a safe place to work and pursue a career,\u201d Mulroney said.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of foreigners in China are looking over their shoulder right now,\u201d he added.\n\nChristopher Sands of the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington said the world took note of how Trump treated Canada during trade negotiations and how the U.S. stayed silent when Saudi Arabia overreacted to Canada\u2019s expression of human rights concerns over treatment of the Saudi dissident.\n\n\u201cIn normal times, the U.S. sends a signal, usually discreetly, to allies to cut it out and play nice,\u201d Sands said.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this worse is that China is lashing out at Canada not for Canada\u2019s initiative, but for Canada\u2019s honoring of a U.S. warrant. The damage done by our silence in terms of alliance relations is truly awful,\u201d he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "U.S. Green Beret Charged with Murder of Man in Afghanistan", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/u-s-green-beret-charged-with-murder-of-man-in-afghanistan/4700394.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:11", "body_paragraphs": "A U.S. Army Green Beret has been charged with the murder of an Afghan man during his 2010 deployment to Afghanistan, a U.S. military spokesman said Thursday.\n\nMajor Matthew Golsteyn has admitted to shooting and killing a man in Afghanistan because he suspected he was a bombmaker for the Taliban militant group, NBC News reported.\n\nGolsteyn admitted twice to the killing, once in an interview for a job at a spy agency and again during an interview with Fox News Channel, NBC News said.\n\n\u201cMajor Matthew Golsteyn\u2019s immediate commander has determined that sufficient evidence exists to warrant the preferral of charges against him,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Loren Bymer, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, said in a statement."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Report: Girl Dies in US Border Patrol Custody", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-girl-dies-in-u-s-border-patrol-custody/4700356.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:11", "body_paragraphs": "A 7-year-old girl who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with her father last week died after being taken into the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol, federal immigration authorities confirmed Thursday.\n\nThe Washington Post reports the girl died of dehydration and shock more than eight hours after she was arrested by agents near Lordsburg, New Mexico. The girl was from Guatemala and was traveling with a group of 163 people who approached agents to turn themselves in on Dec. 6.\n\nEarly Dec. 7, the girl started having seizures, and emergency responders measured her body temperature at 105.7 degrees, the Post said. She was taken to a hospital, where she died, according to the Post.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown what happened to the girl during the eight hours before she started having seizures and was flown to an El Paso hospital.\n\nA spokesman at Providence Hospital in El Paso, Texas, where the Post reported the child was taken, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe names of the girl and her father were not released. The agency, which typically provides food and water to migrants in its custody, is investigating the incident to ensure appropriate policies were followed, the Post said.\n\nIn a statement, Customs and Border Protection said the girl had not eaten or consumed water in several days. The agency did not provide The Associated Press with the statement it gave to the Post, despite repeated requests.\n\nLarge groups pose challenges\n\nProcessing 163 immigrants in one night could have posed challenges for the agency, whose detention facilities are meant to be temporary and don\u2019t usually fit that many people.\n\nWhen a Border Patrol agent arrests someone, that person is processed at a facility but usually spends no more than 72 hours in custody before they are either transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or, if they\u2019re Mexican, quickly deported home.\n\nThe girl\u2019s death raises questions about whether border agents knew she was ill and whether she was fed anything or given anything to drink during the eight-plus hours she was in custody.\n\nTroubles in Tucson Sector\n\nImmigrants, attorneys and activists have long raised issues with the conditions of Border Patrol holding cells. In Tucson, an ongoing lawsuit claims holding cells are filthy, extremely cold and lacking basic necessities such as blankets. A judge overseeing that lawsuit has ordered the agency\u2019s Tucson Sector, which patrols much of the Arizona-Mexico border, to provide blankets and mats to sleep on and to continually turn over surveillance footage from inside the cells.\n\nThe Border Patrol has seen an increasing trend of large groups of immigrants, many with young children, walking up to agents and turning themselves in. Most are Central American and say they are fleeing violence. They turn themselves in instead of trying to circumvent authorities, many with plans to apply for asylum.\n\nAgents in Arizona see groups of more than 100 people on a regular basis, sometimes including infants and toddlers.\n\nArresting such groups poses logistical problems for agents who have to wait on transport vans that are equipped with baby seats to take them to processing facilities, some which are at least half hour north of the border.\n\nToddler died in May\n\nThe death of the 7-year-old comes after a toddler died in May just after being released from an ICE family detention facility in Texas, and as the administration of Donald Trump attempts to ban people from asking for asylum if they crossed the border illegally. A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked that ban, but the administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate it Tuesday.\n\nCynthia Pompa, advocacy manager for the ACLU Border Rights Center, said migrant deaths increased last year even as the number of border crossing dropped.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy represents the worst possible outcome when people, including children, are held in inhumane conditions. Lack of accountability, and a culture of cruelty within CBP have exacerbated policies that lead to migrant deaths,\u201d Pompa said.\n\nReuters news agency contributed to this report."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Launches New Strategy for Africa", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-launches-new-strategy-for-africa/4700332.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:11", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration has unveiled a new strategy for Africa that's focused on countering Chinese and Russian influence on the resource-rich continent.

Moments later, it adopted the second resolution by a voice vote. In both cases, the chamber acted in defiance of the Trump administration, which has strenuously argued against a rupture of cooperation between Washington and Riyadh.\n\n\"Yemen is now experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world,\" Vermont independent Sen.

The U.S. legislature has not authorized America's support role in Saudi Arabia's campaign to combat Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels, a conflict that has led to widespread civilian deaths.\n\nBut some argued that, in this instance, the case for asserting war powers authority is weak.\n\n\"The United States is not involved in combat [in Yemen]. It is not dropping ordinance. It is no longer even providing air-to-air refueling [for Saudi warplanes],\" Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said. \"If the Senate wants to pick a constitutional fight with the executive branch over war powers, I would advise my colleagues to pick a better case.\"\n\n\"If we set the precedent that even an operation such as the refueling of aircraft of allied countries needs congressional authority, we would severely limit the executive branch's ability to respond to international crises and safeguard our global national security interests,\" Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan said.\n\nThat argument did not sway resolution co-author Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, who countered that direct U.S. support for Saudi military actions constitutes unambiguous involvement in the war in Yemen.\n\n\"We're involved in this conflict as co-belligerents [with Saudi Arabia],\" Lee said.\n\nA symbolic gesture\n\nWhile the Senate resolution sends a strong signal of displeasure to Saudi Arabia, it is likely to stand as a largely symbolic gesture for now.

Anger spiked sharply after dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at the kingdom's consulate in Turkey two months ago.\n\nThe second resolution approved by the Senate blames Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's death, expresses support for Yemeni peace talks, and states: \"there is no statutory authorization for United States involvement in hostilities in the Yemen civil war.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said that responsibility for Khashoggi's death remains an open question, and noted Riyadh's repeated denials that the kingdom's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, played a role.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \"America's interests in the region are important \u2026 and we intend to continue to work with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to keep America safe.\"\n\nTrump's critics in the Senate slammed the White House's posture.\n\n\"This administration is putting the Saudi government on a pedestal that stands above American values,\" New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez said. \"They continue to extend a blank check to certain players within the Saudi government, no matter how brazen their actions.\"\n\nThe Senate voted as news emerged of progress in U.N.-sponsored Yemeni peace talks in Sweden, raising hopes that desperately needed humanitarian aid may reach the country.\n\n\n\n\"The pressure of the international community and the United States Senate, making it clear we will not continue to participate in that war, is helping the peace process,\" Sanders said.\n\nOther senators drew a different conclusion.\n\n\"We're actually actively pushing the players to the table to resolve this,\" Oklahoma Republican James Lankford said. \"This is the worst possible moment for this body to start arguing about whose side we should be on.\"\n\nSenators of both parties signaled they intend to push for further sanctions against Saudi Arabia when the new Congress convenes in early January.\n\n\"The current relationship with Saudi Arabia is not working for America,\" South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham said. \"To be an ally of America, more is expected of you, not less.

Tunisia leads the northern Africa region in women\u2019s rights and government representation, but at least 47 percent of the country\u2019s women are affected by domestic violence. Law 58, which took effect in February, offered sweeping protections from physical, economic and psychological abuse, and even outlawed harassment in public.\n\nBut nongovernmental organizations, government officials and survivors of domestic violence who met late last month to assess how the law is being implemented reported a host of shortcomings, from logistical barriers that prevent some women from filing complaints to social pressures that keep others from even trying.\n\nOne woman told the conference of the trouble she faced when filing a report against her husband for assault and economic exploitation. She said police at a local station sent her to a district office so she could file the complaint with a specialized unit, but authorities there turned her away. She eventually managed to take her case to court, but said she was disappointed when the judge only fined her husband 300 dinar, or roughly $100.\n\nThe story illustrates some of the common problems women in Tunisia have been facing as they seek protection under a law that seemed perfect on paper.\n\n\n\nHurdles To Reporting\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to reporting crimes under the new law is the lack of agents trained to handle them, conference participants said.\n\nNabiha Gaddechi, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said 264 agents have completed training and hundreds more are in the pipeline. But the new units specializing in violence against women are still short-staffed, causing hiccups in the report-filing process.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Tunisian Parliament in October 2017.\n\nWomen who head to their local police station to file domestic violence reports are often sent to district offices, which tend to be located in less accessible areas, Gaddechi said. Once there, she added, victims often aren\u2019t offered a private space to file their reports and must do so in the open, sometimes among criminal suspects awaiting processing. Women also can\u2019t file reports at night, which is when most incidents of violence occur. Gaddechi attributed these problems to a lack of staff.\n\nConference participants said there are also many social norms that may lead people to tolerate or even justify violence against women.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs is monitoring whether religious messages are interfering with the application of the law, according to spokesman Slim Bencheikh. However, some agents have abused their power and pressured women against taking their spouses to court, Gaddechi said. She pointed out that this is a clear violation of the law, which states that \u201cany agent who is a part of the specialized unit for investigations into violent offenses against women and who voluntarily exerts pressure, or any sort of coercion, on victims for the purpose of making them give up their rights, change their complaint, or retract it will be punished by one to six (6) months in prison.\u201d\n\nTrouble In The Courts\n\nWomen continue to face challenges, even if they successfully file a report.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many specialized courts equipped to handle cases related to violence against women, said Raoudha Garafi, a court magistrate. Others noted how hard it is for some women to afford a lawyer.\n\nSana Ben Achour, the president of Association Beity, which runs women\u2019s shelters, said there were many reasons to consider punishing offenders in ways that don\u2019t include prison sentences.

Even criminal sexual assault is rarely punished.\n\nActivists\u2019 patient efforts to change that are starting to pay off.\n\nIn late November, officials announced that the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act, long stalled in parliament, may finally be passed in 2019. The bill would protect women from domestic violence, marital rape, sexual violence and workplace harassment, and provide legal and medical support to survivors.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge victory for the pioneering women\u2019s rights groups that helped draft the legislation first proposed in 2013.\n\nBut as revealed in our on-the-ground research on violence against women and gender inequality in Myanmar, the law is not the only thing that needs changing to keep its women safe.\n\nIntimate partner violence is common\n\nAcross the globe, violence against women \u2013 whether physical, sexual or psychological \u2014 is most likely to be perpetrated by their husband or boyfriend.\n\nThirty percent of women worldwide will be abused by a male partner during their lifetime, and the proportion is as high as 68 percent in some countries.\n\nData on intimate partner violence in Myanmar \u2014 which is run by a semi-authoritarian, military-heavy regime \u2014 is slim. But in 2016 the U.S.-funded Demographic and Health Survey, which is conducted in some 100 countries every five years, found that 21 percent of women there reported experiencing physical, sexual or psychological violence at the hands of an intimate partner, particularly slapping, pushing, choking and attacks with weapons.\n\nThe real percentage is likely much higher. Surveys on intimate partner violence typically produce lower-than-actual numbers, in part because many women don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe talking about assault.\n\nAccording to Legal Clinic Myanmar, a charity based in Yangon, 68 percent of the cases they attended in May 2018 concerned gender-based violence.\n\nEvidence also shows that women are more likely to experience violence in countries with high gender inequality. Myanmar ranks 106 of 189 countries in the U.N. Gender Inequality Index.\n\nAP Photo/Altaf Qadri A Rohingya refugee who fled Myanmar. She has convinced her husband to let their eldest daughter study.\n\nOur research sheds light on a high-profile U.N. report released in August, which documented widespread rape and sexual slavery in Myanmar\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Muslim Rohingya people.\n\nThe findings were disturbing. But, for us, they were not surprising. Violence against women is a silent emergency in all Myanmar.\n\nA false belief in gender equality\n\nUnequal gender relations in Myanmar stem from \u201chpon,\u201d a deeply held social belief that considers men to be holy, glorious and spiritually superior. Women are associated with ill omens and bad luck.\n\nHpon translates into both subtle and overt segregation by gender in Myanmar.\n\nPolitics is almost exclusively the domain of men, with women making up around 10 percent of national and state legislatures. In contrast, the male-dominated Myanmar military is guaranteed 25 percent of seats in all governing bodies.\n\nAP Photo/Thein Zaw Buddhism and the military are Myanmar\u2019s two biggest institutions. Both are male dominated.\n\nWomen in this Buddhist-majority country are not allowed to access certain religious spaces. Their garments are washed separately, so as not to contaminate men\u2019s clothing.\n\nThough hpon devalues women, we have found in interviews that people in Myanmar think that men and women enjoy equal status.\n\nThey point to women and men\u2019s relatively equal education levels, for example, or observe that women get to keep their last names after marriage. Women in Myanmar can also travel freely without a male escort, giving them relative independence compared to women in neighboring South Asian countries.\n\nPositive views of gender equality in Myanmar also celebrate a few very high-achieving women \u2014 most of them from upper-class backgrounds.\n\nThese exceptional figures include Queen Shin Saw Pu, who reigned the Mon Kingdom from 1453 to 1472, the 20th-century education campaigner Daw Mya Sein and leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 2015.\n\nDamir Sagolj/Pool Photo via AP Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi (left, with Chinese President Xi Jinping) is often cited as an example that women have equal opportunity in Myanmar.\n\nBlaming the victim\n\nBut the success of a few is not the same as equality for all.\n\nThe misperception of gender equality in Myanmar can actually make life harder for women who are seen to fall short of these high ideals, we found, because they feel like deviants in an otherwise equal and peaceful society.\n\nAfter a Myanmar model sued her boyfriend for rape in September 2018 \u2014 a very rare legal challenge in Myanmar \u2014 she was viciously attacked on social media, where she was called a \u201cprostitute\u201d and a \u201cwoman of low morals.\u201d She received hate mail suggesting she was better off dead.\n\nThe social stigma against sexual abuse and harassment in Myanmar society means most abuse survivors never report their experiences.\n\nMany women we interviewed have kept silent about domestic violence because they believe friends and family would say it was their \u201cwifely duty\u201d to be patient and quiet.\n\nOthers feared retaliation if they made their abuse known.\n\nGender inequality in Myanmar also limits women\u2019s ability to leave abusive relationships. Many women are financially and socially dependent on their partners, and would face social isolation, stigma and financial insecurity if they fled.\n\nMale-dominated institutions\n\nSince men dominate Myanmar\u2019s political, legal and criminal justice institutions, women also fear that reporting domestic violence will not protect them.\n\nOnly 1 percent of women who seek help after physical or sexual violence go to the police, according to the Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nWhen they do, they are not often believed.\n\nOne woman we spoke with said that she reported her violent husband to law enforcement, only to have her case dismissed. She said her husband paid the local police to ignore her.\n\nMyanmar society also typically turns a blind eye toward sexual abuse by soldiers and Buddhist monks, members of the country\u2019s two most powerful institutions.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s fitful transition from dictatorship toward democracy in recent years is giving women the opportunity, for the first time in history, to fight for their legal rights.\n\nIf the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act is passed next year, it will not fix the entrenched gender inequality that makes Myanmar women vulnerable to sexual violence.\n\nBut it is a critical step in the right direction.\n\nStephanie Miedema is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Emory University.

Also on the hackers\u2019 hit list: high-profile defenders, detractors and enforcers of the nuclear deal struck between Washington and Tehran, as well as Arab atomic scientists, Iranian civil society figures and D.C. think tank employees.\n\n\u201cPresumably, some of this is about figuring out what is going on with sanctions,\u201d said Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written about Iranian cyberespionage and was among those targeted.\n\nKagan said he was alarmed by the targeting of foreign nuclear experts.\n\n\u201cThis is a little more worrisome than I would have expected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hit list surfaced after Charming Kitten mistakenly left one of its servers open to the internet last month. Researchers at Certfa found the server and extracted a list of 77 Gmail and Yahoo addresses targeted by the hackers that they handed to the AP for further analysis. Although those addresses likely represent only a fraction of the hackers\u2019 overall effort \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear how many of the accounts were successfully compromised \u2014 they still provide considerable insight into Tehran\u2019s espionage priorities.\n\n\u201cThe targets are very specific,\u201d Certfa researcher Nariman Gharib said.\n\nAP Photo/Raphael Satter Certfa researchers Nariman Gharib, left, and Amin Sabeti, shown at a cafe in London on Dec. 7, 2018. Certfa helped uncover the Charming Kitten campaign.\n\nIn a report published Thursday, Cerfta tied the hackers to the Iranian government, a judgment drawn in part on operational blunders, including a couple of cases where the hackers appeared to have accidentally revealed that they were operating from computers inside Iran. The assessment was backed by others who have tracked Charming Kitten. Allison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks, recognized some of the digital infrastructure in Certfa\u2019s report and said the hackers\u2019 past operations left little doubt they were government-backed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear-cut,\u201d she said.\n\nCalls to Iranian officials were not returned late Wednesday, the beginning of the weekend in the country.\n\nIran has previously denied responsibility for hacking operations, but an AP analysis of its targets suggests that Charming Kitten is working in close alignment with the Islamic Republic\u2019s interests. The most striking among them were the nuclear officials \u2014 a scientist working on a civilian nuclear project for the Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense, a senior operator at the Research and Training Reactor in the Jordanian city of Ramtha, and a high-ranking researcher at the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.\n\nThe trio suggested a general interest in nuclear technology and administration. Others on the hit list \u2014 such as Guy Roberts, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs \u2014 pointed to an eagerness to keep track of officials charged with overseeing America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been worried about,\u201d Roberts said when alerted to his presence on the list.\n\nStill more targets are connected to the Iran deal \u2014 a 2015 pact negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and other world powers that called for Tehran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump tore up the deal in May over the objections of most of America\u2019s allies and has re-imposed a series of punishing restrictions on Iran since.\n\nOne of Charming Kitten\u2019s targets was Andrew J. Grotto, whose tenure on the U.S. National Security Council straddled the Obama and Trump administrations and who has written about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nJarrett Blanc, the State Department coordinator responsible for the implementation of the nuclear deal under Obama, was also on the list. He said news of his targeting was no shock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve retained contact with Iranian counterparts since leaving government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if there were not Iranian groups trying to hack into my various email accounts.\u201d\n\nLike the Russian hackers who have chased after America\u2019s drone, space and submarine secrets, the list indicates that Iranian spies were also interested in the world of U.S. defense companies. One of those targeted is a senior director of \u201cbreakthrough technology\u201d at the aerospace arm of Honeywell International Inc., the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate; another is a vice president at Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp., a prominent Pentagon contractor.\n\nHoneywell said it was aware that one of its employees had their personal account \u201cexposed,\u201d adding that there was no evidence that the company\u2019s network was compromised. SAIC said it found no trace of any hacking attempt against its employee\u2019s account.\n\nThere were Iranian targets too, including media workers, an agronomist and a senior employee of the country\u2019s Department of Environment \u2014 a possible sign that Tehran\u2019s crackdown on environmentalists, which began earlier this year, continues apace.\n\nHacking has long been a feature of the tense relationship between the United States and Iran, whose militant brand of Shia Islam has challenged American interests in the Middle East since 1979.\n\nIt was against Iran that U.S. and Israeli spies are said to have deployed the pioneering, centrifuge-rattling computer worm dubbed Stuxnet in a bid to sabotage the country\u2019s uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian hackers in turn are blamed for denial of service assaults on American banks and computer-wrecking cyberattacks in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s regional archrival.\n\nThe Charming Kitten campaign uncovered by Certfa is far less sophisticated, generally relying on a password-stealing technique called phishing. Two Nov. 17 emails provided to the AP by Jim Sisco of Enodo Global Inc., a Virginia-based risk advisory firm that was targeted by Charming Kitten, mimic the look and feel of Gmail security alerts, a technique used by hackers across the globe.\n\nAn analysis of Certfa\u2019s data shows the group targeted at least 13 U.S. Treasury employees\u2019 personal emails, including one belonging to a director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which fights money laundering and terror financing, and one used by the Iran licensing chief at the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is in charge of enforcing U.S. sanctions. But a few employees\u2019 LinkedIn profiles referenced back office jobs or routine tax work.\n\nThat suggested \u201ca fairly scattershot attempt,\u201d said Clay Stevenson, a former Treasury official who now consults on sanctions and was himself targeted by Charming Kitten.\n\nOthers\u2019 experience suggests a more professional effort.\n\nGeorgetown University professor and South Asia security expert Christine Fair said she had only recently returned from a conference in Afghanistan attended by Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian border when she learned she was in the hackers\u2019 sights.\n\n\u201cThe timing is uncanny,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Charming Kitten target was an intern working for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that has been one of the Iran deal\u2019s fiercest critics. How the intern \u2014 whose email isn\u2019t public and whose name appears nowhere on the organization\u2019s website \u2014 crossed the hackers\u2019 radar is not clear. The foundation issued a statement calling the revelation \u201cyet another indicator that Iran must be viewed as a nefarious actor in all theatres in which it operates.\u201d\n\nKagan, the scholar, said most signs pointed to a serious, state-backed operation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like freelancers,\u201d he said.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Donald Trump's Old Tweets About Barack Obama's Vacations Come Back To Bite Him", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-barack-obama-old-tweets_us_5c1355b1e4b0539b3213697c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:20", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama faced relentless criticism during his time in office for taking vacations.

He was identified last year as a suspect in a rape but was not apprehended until after Aguilar's abduction.\n\nA North Carolina prosecutor said 34-year-old Michael McLellan should have been jailed in 2017 when DNA identified him as a suspect in an unsolved rape but instead \u2014 through an oversight \u2014 was free when 13-year-old Hania Aguilar was abducted and killed last month.\n\n\u201cIn all likelihood had this gone forward and we established a case against him at that time, Hania would not have died,\u201d Robeson County District Attorney Johnson Britt told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nLess than a week ago, multiple charges were filed against McLellan in connection with Aguilar\u2019s slaying \u2014 including first-degree murder, first-degree forcible rape, statutory rape, abduction of a child and first-degree kidnapping, according to the FBI.\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff\u2019s Office was notified last year that CODIS \u2014 a federal DNA database \u2014 identified McLellan as the suspect in a 2016 rape, Britt said, and his office was copied on that notification.\n\n\u201cWhen they received the CODIS hit, that would\u2019ve given them probable cause to get a search warrant to obtain a known DNA sample from McLellan,\u201d Britt said. A conviction in the rape, he added, could have resulted in a life prison sentence.\n\nBut none of that happened, and apparently, no one knows why.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if [the paperwork] got lost in the sheriff\u2019s department, if it got buried on someone\u2019s desk, if it got placed in records,\u201d Britt said. \u201cIt just vanished.\u201d\n\nThe mistake hangs heavy over the tragic details of Aguilar\u2019s case.\n\nShe was abducted outside her Lumberton home on Nov. 5, sparking a nationwide manhunt. The search for the missing teen came to a bitter end on Nov. 22, when her decomposing body was found not far from where she was taken.\n\nThe final autopsy report, which could reveal the cause of her death, is not yet complete, the FBI said.\n\nAs in the 2016 rape case, DNA evidence was allegedly used to link McLellan to Aguilar\u2019s slaying.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if McLellan was on the radar of detectives in Aguilar\u2019s case before CODIS identified him as a suspect. Although the possibility that he might be a danger should have been as plain as the teardrop tattoos on his face.\n\nMcLellan\u2019s rap sheet, according to WBTW News, goes back nearly 20 years. It contains convictions for multiple crimes, including assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, breaking and entering, burglary, larceny and two separate convictions of assault on a child under the age of 12.\n\nIn October \u2014 just weeks before Aguilar\u2019s abduction \u2014 he was accused of kidnapping and attempting to rob a woman at gunpoint in Fairmount, WBTW News reported. He turned himself in to police on Nov. 13.\n\nAnd now, authorities allege, McLellan killed a teenage girl who would likely still be alive if not for an oversight on their part. It\u2019s something Britt said he had to inform her family about before the press conference.\n\n\u201cWe were actually meeting with Hania\u2019s mother and her stepfather to explain to them what had happened, to express my regret and our regret that this had been missed.\u201d\n\nFBI Aguilar was abducted outside her Lumberton home on Nov. 5, police said. The search for her ended Nov. 22, when her body was found not far from where she was taken.\n\nThe news was delivered just days after the family was informed that the State Department denied a temporary visa to Aguilar\u2019s father, a Guatemalan citizen. Several politicians, including North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, urged the State Department to reconsider, but the agency refused to budge.\n\nNaimeh Salem, the Texas-based immigration lawyer who represented the father, told The New York Times her client had \u201cno negative immigration history.\u201d She blamed President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cWith past administrations, we never had a problem like this,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cWith this administration, most everything that is discretionary is getting denied.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Aguilar\u2019s father was unable to attend her funeral on Saturday.\n\nMcLellan is being held without bond in the Robeson County Detention Center. In addition to the charges filed in connection with Aguilar\u2019s slaying, authorities said, he is facing charges of first-degree rape and first-degree burglary from the 2016 case. His next court date is scheduled for Dec 21.\n\nAccording to Britt, his office and the sheriff\u2019s office are conducting internal investigations into how the 2017 CODIS alert slipped through the cracks.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am,\u201d Britt said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Tan France Says He's Not 'A Damn Security Risk' After TSA Experience", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tan-france-to-tsa-im-brown-but-that-does-not-mean-im-a-damn-security-risk_us_5c12a517e4b0449012f7ee2b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:21", "body_paragraphs": "Tan France called out the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday for the treatment he received from airport agents.\n\nThe \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star tweeted at the official TSA account about recent experiences at airport security, and also vented about the incidents on his Instagram story.

I have to say, though, I am not surprised.\n\nWomen and couples \u2014 famous or not \u2014 who choose to publicly share their struggles with infertility will most certainly hear from friends, acquaintances, family members, strangers or online trolls who have something negative, judgmental or downright nasty to say about what they are going through and the choices they have made in their journey. Once a woman chooses to open up about her troubles conceiving, the \u201cadvice\u201d comes pouring in.\n\nI know this because I experienced it.\n\nWhen my husband and I finally accepted the fact that we were not going to be able to get pregnant without help, I was 40 years old. As an OB/GYN and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, I knew the challenges I could face but was still in no way prepared for the journey that lay ahead.\n\nI decided early on to share my experience with infertility in an op-ed in The Washington Post, in which I explained my reasons for delaying childbearing and the potential troubles with conceiving after age 40 and gave insight into the increasing use of assisted reproductive technology for women trying to conceive after age 35. I truly believed the response would be positive. After all, I had opened the door to a very private and personal struggle in order to educate other women like me and hopefully prevent someone else from going through what I had gone through.\n\nOverall, the response was positive, but here are just a few of the numerous other comments I received on various outlets:\n\nMaybe she could have been a great mother. She will never know now. Maybe she thought she could have it all. If her mother thought so, she probably would never have existed. Glad my mother did not refuse her destiny for the sake of money. The planet is vastly overpopulated. The last thing we need is assisted human fertility. Contribute to the greater good: refrain from breeding. The species will manage just fine without your precious contribution to the gene pool. Find a less selfish way to give yourself a meaningful life. There are millions of existing disadvantaged kids who could use a hand, for starters. God has not given you children for a reason. You need to listen and find other ways to fulfill yourself. You are just trying to get attention. You chose a career over family. You made your bed and are lying in it now. I hope the money was worth it, doctor.\n\nAnd some comments were much more vile.\n\nMany women struggling to conceive choose to share their stories with the intention of shedding light on a taboo topic and helping others who are experiencing something similar feel that they are not so alone. I truly believe it is a selfless act because, as a woman, not being able to conceive is one of the hardest, most humiliating and most personal life events to experience. Celebrities have a much bigger platform, so some bravely choose to use that platform to reach more women and couples.\n\nBut one can quickly come to second-guess that choice when faced with damaging comments, even if they are few. The people making these harmful comments must not understand or even consider that every woman in this situation already carries a tremendous amount of guilt and shame and questions herself and her decisions daily. After all, a woman struggling with infertility is still a woman with a heart, and comments like that hurt.\n\nDespite all the wonderful and encouraging words of support, it was comments like these that stuck in my head, put a pit in my stomach and gave me doubts.\n\nThankfully, I am not one to let anyone or anything get the best of me. I went on to share in another very personal piece how I became pregnant with twins via an egg donor, and I still write about and share my experiences with fertility, pregnancy and motherhood after age 40.\n\nI am contacted by many women seeking advice, words of encouragement or a shoulder to lean on. I still get hateful, aggressive, ridiculous critiques, but I have grown a much thicker skin and can let them roll off. I have made a conscious decision to remain transparent despite any negativity thrown my way. I am frequently asked why I speak so freely and am willing to take a hit for the infertility struggle. The answer I give is simple.\n\nIf I can help just one woman on a path similar to mine or any woman living with infertility, it is worth it, and I have every intention of being honest about every step of the path I took.\n\nMaybe it is the doctor in me who wants to help and heal. Maybe, in some way, sharing my experiences has been therapeutic for me. Maybe I am willing to be the cautionary tale for other women who think they can easily get pregnant later in life, when the reality is that many women in the media who are getting pregnant well into their 40s are doing so with assisted reproductive technology and egg donor but aren\u2019t willing to share that part of their story. Maybe I hope my choice to be transparent is making others more willing to share their stories and take away a little of the shame one journey at a time.\n\nSo to Union and all the other women sharing their unconventional journeys to motherhood, thank you. Thank you for your openness and transparency. You are brave, you are strong, and you are my heroes. You are helping many women who haven\u2019t found a voice and are still waiting. The good that will come of your efforts will far outweigh the bad and the ugly. I promise.\n\nDo you have a personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Inaugural Fund and Super PAC Said to Be Scrutinized for Illegal Foreign Donations", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:25", "body_paragraphs": "The prosecutors in Manhattan were apparently following up on leads from their case against Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former longtime fixer. Mr. Cohen was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in prison, in part for organizing payments to cover up sex scandals that could have threatened Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House.\n\nAmong other documents seized during raids on Mr. Cohen\u2019s home and office in the spring, investigators found a tape recording of a conversation with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a friend of Melania Trump\u2019s, who ran entities that collected $26 million from the fund. Ms. Winston Wolkoff blamed Mr. Barrack for news reports questioning the payments to her and criticized him for failing to properly manage the account, according to people who spoke with her. She complained about how he had handled the money to several friends, including Mr. Cohen, those people said.\n\nThe inaugural committee complied with all laws and \u201chas not been contacted by any prosecutors,\u201d said Mr. Blicksilver, who is also a spokesman for the fund. Its finances \u201cwere fully audited internally and independently,\u201d and donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, as required, he said.\n\nIn fact, though, the fund has already run into trouble related for both donations and expenditures. Mr. Gates, who is awaiting sentencing for crimes related to a financial fraud scheme he executed with Mr. Manafort, has testified that he may have submitted personal expenses for reimbursement from the fund. A later review of the inaugural expenses found no issue with his reimbursements, a person close to Mr. Gates said.\n\nAnd this year, a well-known Republican lobbyist, Sam Patten, pleaded guilty to arranging for a Ukrainian oligarch and another foreigner to buy $50,000 worth of tickets to an inaugural event, using an American as a straw purchaser.\n\nInvestigators have asked witnesses whether other foreigners also contributed illegally to the inaugural committee. Once Mr. Trump was elected, foreign governments were frantically trying to build connections to the incoming administration, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although it hosts and heavily subsidizes an American military base, Qatar is constantly striving to counter the influence of its powerful neighbors, also allies of the United States."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Maria Butina Pleads Guilty to Role in a Russian Effort to Influence Conservatives", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/butina-guilty.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:25", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 To the conservative Americans she courted, Maria Butina was the right kind of Russian.\n\nShe loved guns and the church and networking with top officials in the National Rifle Association.

She spent Thanksgiving at a congressman\u2019s country house, took a Trump campaign aide to see the rock band Styx and helped a Rockefeller heir organize \u201cfriendship dinners\u201d with influential Washingtonians.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Butina, 30, pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to act as a foreign agent in a deal with federal prosecutors. In doing so, she acknowledged that her activities were motivated by more than mere personal conviction.\n\nAs part of the deal, Ms. Butina admitted to being involved in an organized effort, backed by Russian officials, to open up unofficial lines of communication with influential Americans in the N.R.A. and in the Republican Party, and to win them over to the idea of Russia as a friend, not a foe.\n\nMs. Butina\u2019s guilty plea now casts a spotlight on the Americans she worked with, including prominent members of the N.R.A. and her boyfriend, Paul Erickson, 56, a longtime Republican operative who ran Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign and who now faces accusations of fraud in three states. Officials have said federal investigators are examining what Mr. Erickson and others who helped Ms. Butina knew about her links to the Russian government."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Improvises New Defense in Hush Money Payments", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-cohen-blame.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:25", "body_paragraphs": "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump firmly told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had not known about the payments.

Eisen, the co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said prosecutors in the Southern District of New York appeared to be building a broader case against the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign, possibly for whatever role they may have played regarding illegal campaign donations, using Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea as a steppingstone.\n\n\u201cThe big fish here are the Trump campaign, the Trump Organization and, as an unindicted co-conspirator, the president himself,\u201d Mr. Eisen said.\n\nFor months, the president has demeaned Mr. Cohen, calling him weak and praising other former aides who have refused to cooperate with the authorities.

Weight training may not have the same effect, the study found, raising interesting questions about how various types of exercise affect us at a microscopic level and whether the differences should perhaps influence how we choose to move.\n\nThere is mounting and rousing evidence that being physically active affects how we age, with older people who exercise typically being healthier, more fit, better muscled and less likely to develop a variety of diseases and disabilities than their sedentary peers. But precisely how, at an interior, molecular level, exercise might be keeping us youthful has not been altogether clear. Past studies have shown that exercise alters the workings of many genes, as well as the immune system, muscle-repair mechanisms and many other systems within the body.\n\nSome researchers have speculated that the most pervasive anti-aging effects of exercise may occur at the tips of our chromosomes, which are capped with tiny bits of matter known as telomeres. Telomeres seem to protect our DNA from damage during cell division but, unfortunately, shorten and fray as a cell ages. At some point, they no longer safeguard our DNA, and the cell becomes frail and inactive or dies.\n\nMany scientists believe that telomere length is a useful measure of a cell\u2019s functional age.\n\nBut researchers also have found that telomeres are mutable. They can be lengthened or shortened by lifestyle, including exercise. A 2009 study, for instance, found that middle-aged competitive runners tended to have much longer telomeres than inactive people of the same age. Their telomeres were, in fact, almost as lengthy of those of healthy, young people. But that study was associational; it showed only that older people who ran also were people with extended telomeres, not that the exercise necessarily caused that desirable condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "MIND: Can We Really Inherit Trauma?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/mind-epigenetics-genes.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-14 09:12:30", "body_paragraphs": "One working theory is based on animal research. In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M. Greally, a professor of genetics, medicine, and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cBut as usual, the story that\u2019s often told is overblown relative to the results, and too much causality is claimed.\u201d"}]
