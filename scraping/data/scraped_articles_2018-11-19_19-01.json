They're below.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. \"And I will tell you I'm extremely upbeat, the White House is running like a well-oiled machine. It's doing really well, I have great people.\"\n\nAnd away we go!\n\n2. \"My wife did a great job in Africa, and she was not treated properly by the press.\"\n\nThe question Trump was asked? Why First Lady Melania Trump publicly called for the firing of the firing of an aide on the National Security Council . But sure, Trump says the media is unfair!\n\n3. \"She was with me for a long time, although I don't know her. She's really somebody I don't know very well. But we're going to move her around because she's got certain talents.\"\n\nOK, so here's Trump on Mira Ricardel , the NSC staffer removed at the request of Melania Trump: 1) She was with him for a long time b) He doesn't know her c) He doesn't know her very well c) She'll stay within the administration because she has \"certain talents.\" We all clear on that? Good!\n\n4. \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\"\n\nIf you are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, this answer can't be terribly comforting. The problem for anyone in Trump's administration tasked with managing the border is that you will never do well enough in his eyes; it's the issue he ran on and cares deeply about but also has totally unrealistic expectations of what can be done there.\n\n5. \"Well there's a chance.\"\n\nTrump's take on whether there's a \"chance\" Nielsen stays in her job is utterly Trumpian. \"Well there's a chance\" could, literally, function as his answer to every single question ever asked of him.\n\n6. \"There are certain things I love what he does. And there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- that aren't his strength.\"\n\nIt's remarkable how willing Trump is to assess his top staffers in a public forum like an interview on Fox News Channel. If you are White House chief of staff John Kelly, who Trump is talking about here, and you watch this on TV, you have to start looking for another job ASAP, right?\n\n7. \"It could happen. Yes it could -- I mean it could be. But let's see what happens.\"\n\nThis Trump answer is about Kelly lasting through 2020. But much like \"there's a chance,\" this answer could function as a sort of catch-all for Trump's response to ANY query. Might happen. Might not. Let's see how it plays out.\n\n8. \"I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\"\n\nIf you believe that Trump had NO idea that Matt Whitaker had been publicly opposed to many aspects of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, I have a guy named Carmelo Anthony who will DEFINITELY make your NBA team better.\n\n9. \"If you look at those statements -- those statements that can -- they really can be viewed really either way.\"\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel. If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\" -- Matt Whitaker, November 2017 . Totally can see that in a lot of different ways....\n\n10. \"So if he said there is collusion, I'm supposed to be taking somebody that says there is?\"\n\nThis shows just how little Trump gets about how Justice Department officials should behave. He has no conception that Whitaker concluding that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians even as the probe is ongoing might not be seen as the right thing to do. And to be clear: There is no public proof that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in 2016. There may never be any proof. But since this is an ongoing investigation, all we can say is that there is not currently evidence of collusion. And, yes, that nuance is lost on Trump.\n\n11. \"And all these people that say I'm going to end the investigation, you know, they've been saying that now for -- how long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for, what?\"\n\n12. \"There was no collusion whatsoever, and the whole thing is a scam.\"\n\n13. \"I'm the one that does the answering.\"\n\nTrump is VERY focused on ensuring that everyone knows that he is the one answering the questions from Mueller's team. Why? I think because he wants to look as smart and as tough as possible. And he hates any perception that he has to have other people do something because he's not strong enough or smart enough to do it himself.\n\n14. \"They're writing what I tell them to write.\"\n\nSee #13.\n\n15. 'I would say probably. Probably. I mean, I can change my mind, but probably.\"\n\nThis is Trump on whether he's ruled out sitting down in person with Mueller's team. It's amazing how he simply cannot or will not be definitive about, well, anything. Everything is a negotiation, a possible deal.\n\n16. \"I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished.\"\n\n17. WALLACE: \"You ran a casino, sir.\" TRUMP: \"You're right, and very successfully, actually.\"\n\n18. \"Because it's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it.\"\n\nLook, I can understand the desire of ANY human not to hear the suffering of another human -- in this case the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was tortured and murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. But Trump is not just anyone. He's the President of the United States. And an argument can be made that listening to the last moments of Khashoggi's life might, finally, drive home the atrocity of what happened here and how the Saudis continue to play fast and loose with the truth.\n\n19. \"I don't -- I don't know. You know, who can really know? But I can say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.\"\n\nAnother example of Trump willing to bend over backward to give an ally -- in this case Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman -- the benefit of the doubt. Trump's comments about MBS came on the same day that sources told CNN that the CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered Khashoggi's murder\n\n20. \"Well, will anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know?\"\n\nTrump's moral relativism is on stark display here. The CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered the murder of Khashoggi. MBS has denied it to Trump. So Trump concludes that we can never, ever know the truth. Just throw your hands up and move on.\n\n21. \"But at the same time we do have an ally, and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\"\n\nAnd now we are at the key point of the MBS-Khashoggi situation. The Saudis have repeatedly changed their story. They said Khashoggi's death was an accident. Then they said he was murdered. Then they said MBS and his people knew nothing. Then they admitted people close to MBS carried out the murder. Now the CIA has concluded that MBS personally ordered the murder. But because Saudi Arabia is an important economic ally, Trump is willing to suspend disbelief and say, essentially, \"Who can know what happened???\"\n\n22. \"I won the Senate, you don't mention that.\"\n\nHe won the Senate. Not the candidates, or the party -- Donald Trump won it.\n\n23. \"I won the Senate. ... Number two, I wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\nUm. So, Trump won the Senate but any losses can't be blamed on him because he wasn't on the ballot. [Puts on green accountant visor thing-y] Yup, this all adds up.\n\n24. \"But I had people and you see the polls, how good they are, I had people that won't vote unless I'm on the ballot, OK? And I wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\nI love a good word salad.\n\n25. \"And it was all stacked against Brian, and I was the one that went for Brian and Brian won.\"\n\nBrian Kemp did win the Georgia governor's race. But it was not stacked against him. At all. The last time a Democrat was elected governor of Georgia was Roy Barnes in 1998.The last time a Democrat won Georgia in a presidential race was Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\n26. \"Rick Scott won and he won by a lot.\"\n\nScott won by 10,033 votes. Out of more than 8 million cast.\n\n27. \"If I didn't put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would have lost that election, OK?\"\n\nIn which the President of the United States take credit for blocking non-existent voter fraud.\n\n28. \"I didn't run. I wasn't running. My name wasn't on the ballot.\"\n\n\"I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me. I want you to vote. Pretend I'm on the ballot.\" -- Donald Trump, last month\n\n29. \"Nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do.\"\n\nSo, um, the thing is ... well, yeah, OK.\n\n30. \"Actually, I like to do it but in many cases I don't.\"\n\nThis is Donald Trump's answer to the question of why he calls on CNN's Jim Acosta. If you can explain what he means, I owe you a Coke\n\n31. \"They know when the news is fake, and they get angry when they see all of the fakeness.\"\n\nRemember that when Trump says \"fake news\" you should read that as \"news that is not as favorable to me as I would like.\"\n\n32. \"I don't mind getting bad news if I'm wrong.\"\n\nThe catch here is that Trump, truly, never thinks he does anything wrong. And therefore, the news is always fake if it suggests he has made any sort of mistake -- ever.\n\n33. \"The news about me is largely phony. It's false. Even sometimes they'll say, 'Sources say.' There is no source, in many cases -- in cases there is.\"\n\nAgain, this is about Donald Trump not liking the news. Not about the news being \"largely phony.\" And the idea that mainstream media organizations make up sources is beyond ridiculous.\n\n34. \"He's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama backer.\"\n\nTrump is talking here about William McRaven, the former head of US Special Operations Command and the architect of the raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. Why? Because McRaven said that Trump's attempts to undermine the press were a threat to democracy. And because Trump is incapable of seeing anything outside of a purely partisan lens. Also, Trump is wrong about McRaven's political preferences; \"I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else,\" McRaven told CNN\n\n35. \"Would it have been nicer if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it been nice? Living -- think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan and what I guess in what they considered a nice mansion. I don't know, I've seen nicer.\"\n\nA truly incredible take on the bin Laden raid.\n\n36. \"I can tell what's fair and what's not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people.\"\n\n[narrator voice] He can't.\n\n37. \"And, Chris, you know that better, you don't have to sit here and act like a perfect little, wonderful, innocent angel. I know you too well. I knew your father too well, that's not your gene.\"\n\nI am frankly surprised that it took this long for Trump to turn on Wallace. Despite the obvious pro-Trump bias of lots of the shows (and people) on Fox news, Wallace is a straight-shooter and tough questioner. I'm actually surprised, given that, that Trump agreed to sit down for an interview with him.\n\n38. \"I think I'm doing a great job. We have the best economy we've ever had.\"\n\nModesty has never been Trump's strong suit.\n\n39. \"I would give myself, I would -- look, I hate to do it, but I will do it. I would give myself an A-plus, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\"\n\nTwo things: 1) He doesn't hate to do it 2) The President asked if he could give himself a grade higher than an \"A+.\" So, here we are.\n\n40. \"I should have done that, I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling as you know.\"\n\nThis is Trump's explanation on why he didn't go to Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran's Day. \"Extremely busy\" on calls. \"For the country.\"\n\n41. \"I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened.\"\n\nThe question? \"Why haven't you visited our troops serving in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan in the two years you've been in office as commander in chief?\" So, yeah.\n\n42. \"But tone is something that is important to me. But a lot of times you can't practice tone because you have people coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous way, you're not going to win. And we have to win. This country has to win.\"\n\n[nods head very slowly] This feels like a good place to end."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump attacks leading House Democrat in profane tweet", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/uCTiVah-XsM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump disparaged Rep.

Yet others have argued that the appointment is valid because he's only serving on a temporary basis under the Federal Vacancies Act.\n\nAfter firing former Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who angered Trump by recusing himself from issues related to the 2016 campaign, the President chose Whitaker over Rosenstein, who had overseen the Mueller probe.\n\nMueller's appointment and constitutional authority was upheld in August by a federal judge appointed by Trump, who wrote in an opinion that Mueller's \"appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles.\"\n\nSchiff shot back at Trump on Sunday, insinuating in a tweet that the President's lawyers are writing Trump's answers to Mueller's questions in the Russia investigation for the President.\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday that he was personally crafting the answers to Mueller, saying, \"My lawyers don't write answers. I write answers. I was asked a series of questions.

I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush, both of whom I worked for.\"\n\nMcRaven's crime, as far as Trump seems to be concerned, is that he publicly defended former CIA director, John Brennan, in August when the President revoked Brennan's security clearance because of his criticism of Trump.\n\nMcRaven has also stood up for the press, which Trump routinely derides as \"the enemy of the people.\" In a speech in Texas last year McRaven said, \"This sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.\"\n\nIn Sunday's interview, Trump went on to claim that bin Laden was \"living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there.\"\n\nThis is complete nonsense. When I was researching a book about the hunt for bin Laden, I spoke to dozens of key government, intelligence and military officials involved in the bin Laden operation and they all said that the Pakistanis had no clue that al Qaeda's leader was living in the city of Abbottabad, Pakistan where he was found.\n\nOn the night of the bin Laden operation, US officials eavesdropped on the communications of top Pakistani officials who were completely surprised by the news that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad.\n\nIn the interview Sunday, Trump went on to say, \"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that.\" This is an appalling smear on the many dozens of men and women at the CIA who dedicated their entire careers to finding bin Laden both before and after 9/11.\n\nThe fact is that finding bin Laden took a decade after the 9/11 attacks because he wasn't using any form of electronic communication and relied instead on handheld messages delivered by his trusted courier. As a result, even senior leaders of al Qaeda didn't know where bin Laden was hiding.\n\nThe whole issue of the hunt for bin Laden may be a sore subject for Trump because the final countdown for the operation took place during the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner when Obama roasted Trump mercilessly for his penchant for spreading conspiracy theories, such as the so-called \"birther\" conspiracy, which claimed that Obama wasn't an American citizen.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDuring a break from rehearsing that speech for the correspondents' dinner, Obama called McRaven for a final status check.\n\n\"What do you think about the intel?\" Obama asked. The intelligence that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad was entirely circumstantial.\n\n\"Well, if he's there, we're going to get him. If he's not, we won't,\" McRaven answered.\n\n\"Exactly! It's 50-50,\" Obama said, according to reporting from my book about the hunt for bin Laden.\n\nThe president wrapped up the call, saying, \"I couldn't have any more confidence in you than the confidence I have in you and your force. Godspeed to you and your forces. Please pass on to them my personal thanks for their service and the message that I personally will be following this mission very closely.\"\n\nThe bin Laden raid was, of course, a success. Not only was bin Laden killed, but also thousands of important documents about al Qaeda were recovered during the operation. As a result, it is arguably the most successful special operations mission in American history.\n\nAfter stepping down from leading the Special Operations Command, McRaven became the chancellor of the University of Texas, where as an undergraduate he had majored in journalism. (He has since retired from that role.)\n\nIt's an experience that seems to have shaped McRaven's continuing pushback against Trump's assaults on the press."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump on bin Laden: Told you so", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/yopi_HwewLo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is once again claiming he knows best -- this time, criticizing the past military and political leadership for the timeline of the Osama bin Laden capture.\n\nThe issue re-emerged Sunday in a taped interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace.

Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nCNN has spoken to nine aviation experts, including pilots who fly the 737 MAX 8 planes, about the crash. While they all emphasized that only a complete investigation will give a full picture of what actually happened in the cockpit that morning, all have concluded that, in one way or another, Boeing's actions fell short -- leaving not only the families of the victims shaken, but also the aviation industry.\n\nBoeing declined to comment for this article, referring CNN to its most recent statement cited above.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Lion Air plane crashes off Indonesia A relative of one of the crash victims tosses flower petals from an Indonesian Navy ship on Tuesday, November 6.

Hide Caption 27 of 27\n\nA facelift\n\nIn recent years, Lion Air, the popular Indonesian budget carrier, had given itself a makeover.\n\nThe privately owned carrier was the first airline to put Boeing's 737 MAX 8 -- a more efficient and environmentally friendly upgrade of a jet introduced in 1967 -- into service. According to Boeing, the Max jets are said to be 10% to 12% more efficient than their predecessors.\n\nIn 2011, Lion Air announced a $21.7 billion order for 230 of the single-aisle, twin-engine jets -- the largest single order for commercial jets in its history at the time, according to Boeing.\n\nLion Air became the first airline to put the 737 MAX 8 into service, and later started buying more versions -- the 9 and larger 10 in a $6.24 billion deal this year.\n\nThose upgrades may have signaled a bid by Lion Air to rectify its spotty safety record over the last decade, including a 2013 non-fatal crash and a ban from European and US airspace between 2007 and 2016.\n\nThe MAX 8s have been a visible part of that boost. But with any new fleet, pilots must undergo additional training.\n\n\"Generally speaking, when there is a new delivery of aircraft -- even though they are the same family -- airline operators are required to send their pilots for training,\" Bijan Vasigh, professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CNN.\n\nThose training sessions generally take only a few days, but they give the pilots time to familiarize themselves with any new features or changes to the system, Vasigh said.\n\nOne of the MAX 8's new features is an anti-stalling device, the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS). If the MCAS detects that the plane is flying too slowly or steeply, and at risk of stalling, it can automatically lower the airplane's nose.\n\nIt's meant to be a safety mechanism. But the problem, according to Lion Air and a growing chorus of international pilots, was that no one knew about that system.\n\nZwingli Silalahi, Lion Air's operational director, said that Boeing did not suggest additional training for pilots operating the 737 MAX 8. \"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" Zwingli told CNN Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether an angle of attack (AOA) sensor on the outside of the Lion Air plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the MCAS to force the plane's nose down.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nInvestigators said that the day before the crash, the jet experienced problems with its AOA sensor, which was replaced. The last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), also had problems.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Southwest Airlines, a US carrier that also has a fleet of MAX 8 planes, replaced two malfunctioning AOA sensors, during the three weeks before the Lion Air crash.\n\nLion Air was was the first airline to put Boeing's 737 Max 8 into service.\n\nCNN has asked Boeing for a copy of the original manuals issued to carriers who bought the Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing has not provided those operation manuals to CNN. Representatives from American, United and Southwest airlines have all told CNN that Boeing did not include information in its Flight Crew Operations Manual that explained the functions of the new feature.\n\nLion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new system, according to Reuters , which has seen the manual.\n\nCNN has reviewed updated guidance issued by Boeing on November 6, and a subsequent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) emergency directive that reinforced Boeing's update on November 7.\n\n'Doomed'\n\nMary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and the former inspector general of the United States Department of Transportation, said that one of the selling points of the Boeing 737 fleet is that pilots can move from one plane to another easily if they are already trained on one of the jets.\n\nThe fact that Boeing could have failed to include the proper guidance on the new manual could have been an oversight, she said. She also said that updating a manual can be a long process for manufacturers and airlines.\n\nIt's possible that Boeing could have downplayed the changes to the system as a selling point, according to Schiavo, who added that she hoped the error was an \"innocent\" one.\n\nBoeing likely \"assumed it would save the plane when it looks like it might have doomed the plane,\" she added.\n\nA Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) emergency directive sent to all MAX 8 operators on November 7 explained that pilots can stop a malfunctioning automated system on those planes by pressing two buttons.\n\nThe FAA bulletin said that all carriers were to revise their manuals within three days. \"This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain,\" it said.\n\nAutomated systems are known to occasionally malfunction, but trained pilots will know how to counteract those systems. Not sharing that information, Schiavo said, is another matter.\n\nIf pilots were unaware of a new feature -- or how to shut it off if it malfunctions -- they would be set up for failure, she said.\n\n\"All these improvements they (Boeing) market as more efficient and safe. To do that without the training on how to turn it off... I think that the investigators and the reports ... will find it was not an excusable mistake,\" she said, referencing another flight, the 2003 Colgan Air 9446 crash, where the aircraft also experienced a full trim nose down, and was unable to recover.\n\nThere's no way of being able to physically overcome the strength it takes to counteract a full nose stop down, she said, estimating the weight at around 800 pounds of force in the 2003 Colgan Air crash, noting that it was a much smaller regional plane where the pilots were not fighting a computer.\n\n\"I think the industry, the pilot's union -- everyone is so stunned that the plane could do this and that the pilots weren't trained to turn it off knowing it could be a fatal dive,\" Schiavo said.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the aerospace and defense consulting company, Teal Group Corporation, told CNN that he couldn't imagine that Boeing would intentionally leave out important information to pilots just to get a competitive edge over its industry rival.\n\n\"I really can't imagine that being the case, because the system doesn't really require a lot of extra training -- frankly (adding) just an extra page in the book would have sufficed. So, the idea that they did it for competitive reasons, I just don't get that,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nInstead, he believes that it's possible that it might have been an oversight or a \"technical error.\"\n\nAboulafia says that it's \"encouraging\" that pilots are voicing their concerns as their feedback helps keep the industry safe.\n\n\"If I were a consumer I would feel happy that the pilots were making their voices heard. And happy that there was cooperation between manufacturers and regulatory authorities and between the airlines and the pilots -- it's exactly that process that's made the system what it is over the past century of aviation. It's a very healthy triangle of people who communicate and you are seeing that unfold right now as we speak.\"\n\nUnaware of safety features\n\nDennis Tajer is one of those pilots who has flown the 737 MAX 8 planes. The veteran 737 captain for American Airlines, who is a spokesperson for its 15,000 member pilot union, the Allied Pilots Association (APA), told CNN the first time he learned about the MCAS safety feature was through a bulletin issued by Boeing on November 6.\n\nThe company said the bulletin was meant to reinforce procedures already in the 737 MAX flight manual. The APA rejects that claim. Tajer said Boeing broke his trust, the key component of a safety culture that he has been an active part of for over 10 years.\n\n\"When you are describing components of the aircraft that we had no idea that existed, that's what's troubling,\" Tajer said of his first read of that bulletin.\n\n\"We want to know about the new system -- and you are using the cloak of the stabilizer checklist (another related system) to describe things to which I had no knowledge existed,\" he said.\n\nTajer imagines what it might have been like for the Lion Air pilots, who he believes were also unaware of the new system and would have been struggling to understand what was going in the cockpit.\n\n\"They are human beings that are trying to process just what the heck was going on. Like a crowd of 10 people yelling at them while a nefarious and insidious system they had no idea was running on the airplane, is actually running against you.\"\n\nBut not all pilots are pointing the finger at Boeing.\n\nThis week the Seattle Times reported that the chairman of the United Airlines pilots union, which is represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), said that although the original 737 MAX 8 manual did not specify the new safety system, it did include steps on how to shut down the \"flight-control behavior it induces.\"\n\nCapt. Todd Insler, ALPA's chairman of the United branch, said that Lion Air pilots should have been aware of that procedure and that it was too soon to say anything more about the cause of the Lion Air crash.\n\n\"The story here is not why we didn't know about (the new system), it's why the pilots didn't fly the plane,\" Insler said.\n\nIn a letter sent by the ALPA President Capt. Tim Canoll to the FAA and the US National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday, the ALPA said they were \"concerned that a potential, significant aviation system safety deficiency exists\" and asked for \"immediate help and assistance in clarifying the issues with respect to the pitch control system of the aircraft.\"\n\nIt added: \"More importantly...reports indicate that information regarding the normal and non-normal operation of this system was not provided to the frontline airline employees -- the flight crews and maintenance technicians.\"\n\nAn Indonesian National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT) official examines a turbine engine from the Lion Air crash.\n\nVeteran pilot and author Patrick Smith, who does not fly 737 MAX planes, told CNN that it's too soon to determine what could have gone wrong, but that it's possible to say that an alleged system malfunction isn't entirely to blame.\n\nOn Smith's blog , \"Ask a Pilot,\" he wrote: \"Is it too big a step to say that this system, and its apparent malfunction, were entirely to blame? Is there not some basic, seat-of-the-pants airmanship skills that the pilots could have, or should have, fallen back on? If the plane was nosing over, should they not have suspected something was askew with the stabilizers or stabilizer trim, and disconnected power to those controls? Well, that's easy to ask when sitting safely in front of a keyboard, days later. The truth is, we don't know exactly what they were dealing with -- the sights, the sounds, the sensations -- in that cockpit as it was all going to hell.\"\n\nBoth Smith and Tajer believe though, that as dark and horrific as the Lion Air crash was, it has compelled the industry to face difficult questions and push for more transparency and positive learning outcomes, with passengers' safety at the helm.\n\nTajer says that now, his trust in the company is slowly rebuilding and that MAX 8 pilots aren't flying with hesitation now because they have broken through the \"sound barrier\" of information.\n\n\"We won't fly an airplane that's not safe, we've got our customers' backs.\"\n\nAboulafia agrees that there is no reason for consumers to be concerned about what could be a freak incident, adding that technological advances in the industry over the last century have demonstrated that flying is \"now the safest form of transportation ever designed in the history of mankind.\"\n\n\"We don't know the full details of this crash yet, but as for other systems have never been safer,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nSchiavo is a bit more cautious.\n\n\"I personally would avoid the 737 MAX until there is time for the pilots to be retrained,\" she said. \"I like my pilots to know how to troubleshoot in the air.\"\n\nBoeing, which made no comment on the allegations, said it was \"deeply saddened by the loss of Lion Air Flight JT 610.\"\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board.\"\n\nAutomation as collaboration\n\nThe Lion Air crash has again reignited a larger conversation about the use of automated control systems and whether cockpit procedures surrounding these systems are as safe as they should be.\n\nIt's the latest fatal crash involving an auto flight control system. Both the Air France 447 and AirAsia Flight 8501 crashes had flight-control systems and pilots working against each other with disastrous outcomes, begging the question of whether these systems help or hinder pilots.\n\nPeter Goetz, a CNN aviation analyst and former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, believes that ultimately the onus is on transparency and training, and not on automation.\n\n\"Pilots are extraordinarily skilled and if they have the right training and information they will make the right decisions, they will do the right thing. But if they don't know what's confronting them and there's been an increasing reliance on the infallibility of fly-by-wire systems, then you are faced with a real challenge. That's a broader question that's going to be looked at.\"\n\nTajer agrees. He says that technology has definitely increased the safety of our global flight systems but just like a singular dietary plan, it's not always healthy.\n\n\"Automation is an outstanding addition to the aircraft when it's in collaboration,\" Tajer said.\n\n\"But when you don't tell the human about it, it disconnects the human being from the system.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to a safety rating issued by ICAO."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "APEC summit wraps with no joint statement amid US-China discord", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/H0XQQ-O9QGs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) For the first time in its 25-year history, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit ended Sunday with its leaders failing to agree on a formal joint statement.\n\nAll 21 APEC leaders at the annual meeting in Papua New Guinea were in agreement except China, a source within the meeting told CNN.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed late Sunday that disagreements on trade stood in the way of a final statement.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence waves after delivering his keynote speech for the CEO Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Port Moresby on November 17, 2018.\n\n\"There are differing visions on particular elements,\" Trudeau said.\n\nChina may have been concerned about a specific line about unfair trade practices, according to a US official involved in the negotiations.

It was one of several icons looted from the church during this time and believed to be the last recovered.\n\nDutch art detective Arthur Brand poses with the missing mosaic of St. Mark, a rare piece of stolen Byzantine art from Cyprus.

It's one of the last and most beautiful examples of art from the early Byzantine era,\" Brand told Agence France-Presse.\n\nIt was the hunt of a lifetime for Brand and one that took him across Europe, where \"informants were arrested in unrelated cases\" and \"people got scared and disappeared,\" he claimed in a post on his website.\n\nBrand managed to trace the mosaic to an apartment of a British family in Monaco who were \"horrified\" to find out the piece was looted treasure.\n\nHow do art auctions really work?\n\n\"It was in the possession of a British family, who bought the mosaic in good faith more than four decades ago,\" he told AFP.\n\nThe owner, according to Brand, agreed to return the artwork to Cyprus and was offered a symbolic compensation for taking care of it over the years.\n\nBrand is a well known figure in the art crime world. He's recovered well over 200 works of art, including ancient Aztec artifacts, antique porcelain plates and numerous paintings looted by the Nazis.\n\nIn one of his most high profile cases , Brand aided German police in the retrieval of a pair of bronze horse sculptures by Josef Thorak that once belonged to Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn 2016, Brand helped to recover five stolen artworks of the Dutch Golden Age from a Ukrainian militia force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 22 The \"Apollo and Venus\" painting by 16th-century Dutch master Otto van Veen (1556-1629) was discovered in the closet of an art gallery in Iowa, and is likely worth over $4 million.\n\n\n\nScroll through the gallery for other examples of lost and found artworks.

And with 993 people still unaccounted for, officials fear the death toll could keep rising.\n\nCrews are combing the remnants of houses where all evidence of life has been wiped out by flames. Many of the searchers have lost their own homes and are looking for the remains of their neighbors.\n\nWhile the search for the dead and missing continues, thousands of firefighters are trying to control the blaze. As of late Sunday, the Camp Fire had seared 150,000 acres and was 65% contained\n\n'People don't know that we're looking for them'\n\nThough the number of people missing from the Camp Fire has skyrocketed, it's hard to tell exactly how many are lost and how many may be safe elsewhere, officials said.\n\n\"That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls, emails and the 911 system,\" Honea said. \"It's not perfect data, but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection, we're trying to get some progress going.\"\n\nHundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, coroners and anthropologists are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains.\n\n\"There are a lot of people displaced, and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them,\" the sheriff said.\n\n'We're not the only family that's going through this'\n\nSadia Quint has no idea what happened to her uncle, David William Marbury, who lived in a house in the largely obliterated town of Paradise.\n\n\"We already know that his house has been burned down and his car was in his garage,\" Quint said. \"So now we're just waiting for the sheriff's department to go out there and let us know if his body's in there or not.\"\n\nHer family has provided DNA samples in case authorities find Marbury's remains.\n\n\"We're being patient just because we know we're not the only family that's going through this right now,\" Quint said. \"So everyone's kind of in it together and everyone's being really supportive.\"\n\nBut as the hours pass with no news on her uncle, Quint said she's prepared for the worst.\n\n\"He had respiratory issues and he had back problems,\" Quint said. \"It's hard to think about him not being here anymore. But as a family, we have accepted whether we get good or bad news. So we're just prepared for both.\"\n\nEscaping through ditches, front yards\n\nThe harrowing escape from fast-moving flames still haunt Dan Newman.\n\nPhotos: Wildfire evacuees take refuge in Walmart parking lot Photos: Wildfire evacuees take refuge in Walmart parking lot A wildfire evacuee sifts through a pile of clothing at a tent city in a Walmart parking lot in Chico, California, on Saturday, November 17.

William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command, and attacked the military for not having killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before 2011.\n\nHe also dismissed a Washington Post report that the CIA believes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of the paper's journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a possible fresh example of the President ignoring his intelligence agencies when it conflicts with his political goals.\n\nAnd Trump revived alarmist talk over a caravan of asylum seekers marching across Mexico toward the southern border, on which he anchored a midterm campaign that was laced with falsehoods and racism.\n\n\"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months'\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nFor any other president, these attacks and comments would represent an extraordinary breach of White House norms.\n\nFor Trump, they reflect his own combative temperament and willingness to flout conventions and political correctness that he clearly believes are key to his strong bond with his most loyal supporters.\n\nHis jab at Schiff was also a reminder of how the Russia investigation, now thought to be in a critical stage, hovers over everything else that happens in Trump's presidency.\n\nTrump said he will submit written answers to questions posed by Mueller about alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia this week.\n\nNo changing course\n\nThe President's determination to follow his instincts and reluctance to moderate his confrontational approach suggests that there has been little self reflection about the Democratic capture of the House that was fueled on a rejection of Trump by suburban voters.\n\nIt may also indicate that the President will win or lose in his re-election race in 2020 by betting on his strategy of mobilizing an angry political base to win the electoral college, as he did in 2016. Such an approach helped him win Senate seats -- albeit on a favorable electoral map for the GOP -- this year.\n\nBut exit polls showed that 38% of people who cast a vote in House races did so to oppose Trump, compared to 26% who did so to support him.\n\nOne possible remedy would be for Trump to moderate the polarizing behavior that damaged him with women voters and independents in urban areas, to try to win them back to the fold in 2020.\n\nThere have been rare moments of bipartisanship from Trump in recent days. Democrats and Republicans gathered at the White House to celebrate a bill that represents a small step towards criminal justice reform.\n\nTrump tweeted tributes to two foes he had furiously criticized during the midterms -- Democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Andrew Gillum of Florida after they formally conceded defeat.\n\nCongratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia.

His failure to do so in the midterms may have cost him House seats.\n\n\"I recognize it's boring to go out every single day and remind everybody that unemployment is below 4%,\" said Scott Jennings, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush, on CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday.\n\n\"But I think embracing the boring here and doing what he hates, which is to stick with the script, rather than create original programing every day is the right answer.\"\n\nThere are clear signs, however, that Trump is planning to become even less constrained by norms, as evident in his talk of changing his Cabinet.\n\nBy appointing Whitaker, a Mueller critic, in place of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the President has already removed an impediment to his desire to control the Justice Department.\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday\" he said he wants more aggressive enforcement of his hardline immigration policies.\n\nReferring to reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on the way out, Trump said: \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\"\n\nOne senior administration official characterized the President's goals in reshaping his team for CNN's Jake Tapper last week.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" the official said.\n\nRetrenchment still\n\nThe weekend's developments with McRaven and in the Khashoggi case were revealing of the President's approach.\n\nMcRaven was prominent during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and so he was a characteristic target for the President.\n\n\"OK, he's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama-backer, and frankly ... wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?\" Trump told Chris Wallace of Fox News.\n\nMcRaven responded by telling CNN that he did not \"back Hillary Clinton or anyone else\" and said he admired Obama and Bush for leadership in challenging times.\n\n\"I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime,\" McRaven said.\n\nThe Washington Post report about the CIA's conclusions on Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul complicated Trump's efforts to safeguard his close relationship with the Saudi crown prince and will fuel a building confrontation with those in Congress who want serious action against Riyadh.\n\nThe President and the State Department said that no final determination has been made about who ordered Khashoggi's death."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Democrats file suit challenging Whitaker appointment", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/fa48RbuKywo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Three Democratic senators on Monday filed a lawsuit challenging the appointment of acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, ratcheting up the court effort to declare his placement atop the Justice Department as unconstitutional.\n\nSens.

Yet others have argued that the appointment is valid because he's only serving on a temporary basis under the Federal Vacancies Act.\n\nAfter firing former Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who angered Trump by recusing himself from issues related to the 2016 campaign, the President chose Whitaker over Rosenstein, who had overseen the Mueller probe.\n\nMueller's appointment and constitutional authority was upheld in August by a federal judge appointed by Trump, who wrote in an opinion that Mueller's \"appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles.\"\n\nSchiff shot back at Trump on Sunday, insinuating in a tweet that the President's lawyers are writing Trump's answers to Mueller's questions in the Russia investigation for the President.\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday that he was personally crafting the answers to Mueller, saying, \"My lawyers don't write answers.

But there is no pocket of America where the erosion in GOP support is more striking than Orange County.\n\nLaboring against a strong tide of disdain, and even disgust, for President Donald Trump, Republicans lost their grip on the wealthy enclaves along the coast in northern Orange County that comprise the district held by 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. They lost by a much larger margin along the coast farther south in the district of retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which includes the San Clemente home where Richard Nixon holed up to write his memoirs after resigning from the White House.\n\nOn the days leading up to Election Day, GOP officials had been slightly more optimistic that they would hold the inland Orange County district represented by GOP Rep. Mimi Walters, who had served as the deputy chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington. But Walters conceded to her rival, UC-Irvine law professor and Elizabeth Warren prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Katie Porter late last week after the latest batch of ballots counted by election officials made a GOP victory seem impossible.\n\nThe last of the four seats to fall was California's racially-diverse 39th District in northern Orange County. Republican Young Kim, an immigrant from South Korea who highlighted her family's journey to America, was one of the GOP's best hopes for reflecting the growing diversity of a district that is more than a third Hispanic and 31% Asian.\n\nBut Kim conceded to Democrat Gil Cisneros late Saturday night in their race for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce.\n\n\"We are seeing a realignment with college-educated voters and Orange County is ground zero for this phenomenon,\" said Sean Clegg, a California-based Democratic strategist who advises US Sen. Kamala Harris and California Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom. \"This election was a clear referendum on Trump and Trumpism and people want the reality show to end, particularly suburban women.\"\n\nThe Democrats' success in flipping all four seats from red to blue is a stunning development for a county that served as the North Star for Reagan-style conservatism.\n\n\"The cataclysmic losses in Orange County are the manifestation of changing demographics that have been in motion for a couple decades. Trump has accelerated the political consequences the GOP,\" said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist, noting that the lesser-known GOP candidate for governor, John Cox, is still winning the county by a slender margin, according to the latest results posted by the Orange County Registrar of Voters.\n\n\"That's good evidence that the congressional losses are a Trump effect,\" said Stutzman. \"The GOP can compete to win those seats back in two years and new district maps in 2022 will possibly yield a clear GOP seat. The 'Orange Curtain' has fallen but Republicans will still compete in Orange County for the next few election cycles. They'll be more likely to succeed without Trump on the ballot.\"\n\nFred Smoller, an associate professor of political science at Chapman University in Orange County, noted that the GOP now has a 1% registration advantage in the county, compared to a 22% advantage in 1990.\n\n\"The Republican Party has taken a serious hit in Orange County, but it has not collapsed,\" Smoller said in an email. \"The congress folks who won -- Levin and Cisneros -- got their winning margins in San Diego and Los Angeles counties. (The Congressional districts overlap OC). Republicans control the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, and most city councils.\"\n\nStill the sting of the losses was pronounced because of the region's history. Orange County was the place that fostered the conservative movement driven by the John Birch Society in the 1960s.\n\nOrange County activists powered the passage of Prop 13, which limited property taxes, and later the passage of Prop 187 -- the 1994 ballot measure that would have barred immigrants from getting basic state services. That measure, which was ultimately struck down by the courts, irrevocably shifted Latinos in California toward the Democratic Party.\n\nThis time Orange County voters revolted against the racially-tinged and misogynistic rhetoric of Trump. Well-liked incumbents like Walters labored against Trump's villainy of immigrants and the migrant caravan and his suggestion that he could alter birthright citizenship.\n\nMoreover, the Republican tax bill became an albatross for Walters and Rohrabacher because of the way it altered state and local deductions -- a blow to homeowners in a county where the median home price is now beyond $715,000.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Republican losses in the white-collar suburbs of Orange County mark the death knell of establishment Republicans, or if the losses after Trump's hostile takeover of the party alter the calculus in 2020.\n\nBut the possibility that \"Orange is the new blue,\" as Newsom and his Democratic colleagues like to say, marks a stunning transformation for the region and a chilling sign for the establishment wing of the Republicans Party.\n\nReagan delighted in making his \"good Republicans\" quip at fundraisers before GOP donors.\n\nAt one event where he made that joke in Anaheim in November 1986, the then-President also noted how essential Orange County had been to his own success (in his run for governor) and the success of the party.\n\n\"Everything we've accomplished since then in Sacramento and, yes, in Washington began with that margin of victory provided here in Orange County,\" Reagan said.\n\nAfter just one cycle of Trump -- and decades of demographic changes that weigh in Democrats' favor -- the Republican Party is now watching all that work unravel in the place where it began."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Experimental treatment helps 2 out of 3 peanut allergy sufferers, study finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/fsAbGBhY3gg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\"I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,\" the 10-year-old said. \"If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that \"it's not a cure.\"\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\nStill, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is \"treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,\" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nTwo-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\nDr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is \"the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.\"\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

He told the Times: \"It will end up making us look like we're hunting the prime minister down as happened with Margaret Thatcher. It will do the party untold damage in the eyes of the public.\"\n\nAnd former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction.\n\nWhat's the reaction from the EU?\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to \"remain calm\" and focus on the future agreement.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting with the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was \"fair and balanced\" and both sides \"want to avoid using the backstop\".\n\nHe said a transition period extension could not be indefinite, \"it has to be a fixed period of time\".\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory.\n\nThe BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter\n\nMichel Barnier has gone from finger-wagger extraordinaire to salesman-in-chief.\n\nHis remarks about the Withdrawal Agreement could have been scripted by the British government to help sell the deal: it's a fair compromise, the

During this time, the two sides hope to negotiate a permanent trade deal.\n\nThe UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border whatever happens, so they agreed to a \"backstop\" - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - aimed at achieving this if the sides cannot agree a trade deal that avoids a physically visible border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One questioner at the CBI spells out his concerns with the planned deal\n\nThe backstop would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the whole of the UK would be in a single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nThe critics say that during the transition period, the UK will still abide by most of the EU's rules but have no power over setting them - and there is no system for the UK being able to leave any backstop deal without the EU's agreement, so it could become a permanent arrangement.\n\nCould the transition period be extended?\n\nWhen asked whether the transition period could last until the end of 2022, Business Secretary Greg Clark BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It would be at our request and that would be a maximum period.\"\n\nHe said it could be extended for a matter of \"weeks or months\", and added: \"If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that, then it may make sense to extend the transition period.\"\n\nLater, Mrs May told the CBI conference that it was \"important\" to be out of the implementation period before the next general election - which is due in June 2022.\n\nWhat is the latest Tory reaction?\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the five cabinet ministers who were believed to be trying to change the wording of the deal, said on Monday that the prime minister \"has my full support\" and she is doing a \"very good job\".\n\n\"I hope people will get behind her as she endeavours to get the very, very best deal for Britain,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nBut former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson used his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph to renew his criticism of the draft agreement, describing it as a \"585-page fig-leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".\n\nTory MP Anne Marie Morris, from the pro-Brexit ERG faction, told the BBC that she knows of 48 MPs who wish to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May, but \"many of them are holding back their letters, waiting for that meaningful vote\" on the deal.\n\nBut former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell warned against trying to replace Mrs May. He told the Times: \"It will end up making us look like we're hunting the prime minister down as happened with Margaret Thatcher. It will do the party untold damage in the eyes of the public.\"\n\nAnd former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction.\n\nWhat's the reaction from the EU?\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to \"remain calm\" and focus on the future agreement.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting with the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was \"fair and balanced\" and both sides \"want to avoid using the backstop\".\n\nHe said a transition period extension could not be indefinite, \"it has to be a fixed period of time\".\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory.\n\nThe BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter\n\nMichel Barnier has gone from finger-wagger extraordinaire to salesman-in-chief.\n\nHis remarks about the Withdrawal Agreement could have been scripted by the British government to help sell the deal: it's a fair compromise, the EU has moved towards the British position on the Irish backstop which, by the way, won't even be needed because we are going to have a deep and special relationship.\n\nHis call for people to keep calm sounds like it was aimed at the Brexiteer backbenchers who are trying to torpedo the whole package but it may also have been a message to the EU members states not to rock the boat at this last stage, particularly Spain which is kicking up a fuss about how Brexit affects the status of Gibraltar."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link":

During this time, the two sides hope to negotiate a permanent trade deal.\n\nThe UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border whatever happens, so they agreed to a \"backstop\" - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - aimed at achieving this if the sides cannot agree a trade deal that avoids a physically visible border.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One questioner at the CBI spells out his concerns with the planned deal\n\nThe backstop would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the whole of the UK would be in a single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nThe critics say that during the transition period, the UK will still abide by most of the EU's rules but have no power over setting them - and there is no system for the UK being able to leave any backstop deal without the EU's agreement, so it could become a permanent arrangement.\n\nCould the transition period be extended?\n\nWhen asked whether the transition period could last until the end of 2022, Business Secretary Greg Clark BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It would be at our request and that would be a maximum period.\"\n\nHe said it could be extended for a matter of \"weeks or months\", and added: \"If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that, then it may make sense to extend the transition period.\"\n\nLater, Mrs May told the CBI conference that it was \"important\" to be out of the implementation period before the next general election - which is due in June 2022.\n\nWhat is the latest Tory reaction?\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the five cabinet ministers who were believed to be trying to change the wording of the deal, said on Monday that the prime minister \"has my full support\" and she is doing a \"very good job\".\n\n\"I hope people will get behind her as she endeavours to get the very, very best deal for Britain,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nBut former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson used his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph to renew his criticism of the draft agreement, describing it as a \"585-page fig-leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat\".\n\nTory MP Anne Marie Morris, from the pro-Brexit ERG faction, told the BBC that she knows of 48 MPs who wish to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May, but \"many of them are holding back their letters, waiting for that meaningful vote\" on the deal.\n\nBut former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell warned against trying to replace Mrs May. He told the Times: \"It will end up making us look like we're hunting the prime minister down as happened with Margaret Thatcher. It will do the party untold damage in the eyes of the public.\"\n\nAnd former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction.\n\nWhat's the reaction from the EU?\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to \"remain calm\" and focus on the future agreement.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting with the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was \"fair and balanced\" and both sides \"want to avoid using the backstop\".\n\nHe said a transition period extension could not be indefinite, \"it has to be a fixed period of time\".\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory.\n\nThe BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter\n\nMichel Barnier has gone from finger-wagger extraordinaire to salesman-in-chief.\n\nHis remarks about the Withdrawal Agreement could have been scripted by the British government to help sell the deal: it's a fair compromise, the EU has moved towards the British position on the Irish backstop which, by the way, won't even be needed because we are going to have a deep and special relationship.\n\nHis call for people to keep calm sounds like it was aimed at the Brexiteer backbenchers who are trying to torpedo the whole package but it may also have been a message to the EU members states not to rock the boat at this last stage, particularly Spain which is kicking up a fuss about how Brexit affects the status of Gibraltar."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46237012", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:38", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.\n\nChris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.\n\nTransition\n\nThe transition period (which the UK government calls \"implementation period\") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMoney\n\nThe draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or \"divorce bill\") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.\n\nWhile no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least \u00a339bn and it will be paid over a number of years.\n\nPart of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn.\n\nIf the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the \"divorce bill\" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.\n\nMoney remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.\n\nCitizens' rights\n\nThis is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.\n\nUK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.\n\nCitizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.\n\nAnyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nBritish citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.\n\nNorthern Ireland/the backstop\n\nIf no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of \"a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom\" will be triggered.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.\n\nAs long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to \"level playing field conditions\", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.\n\nThe UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.\n\nThat upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nThe agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.\n\nThe document says: \"The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.\n\nIt's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.\n\nLaws and disputes\n\nThe UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.\n\nA joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIf the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.\n\nInstead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.\n\nThat is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\nElsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.\n\nThere's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.\n\nEU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like \"Welsh Lamb\" or \"Parma Ham\" remain.\n\nAlongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Rudd 'to listen to universal credit concerns'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46265558", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:40", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amber Rudd: \"I know there are problems with universal credit despite its good intentions...I know it can be better.\"\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has agreed to listen \"very carefully\" to concerns over universal credit, conceding the system \"can be better\".\n\nMaking her first Commons appearance since getting the job on Friday, she faced calls from Labour and the SNP to halt the rollout of the single benefit.\n\nShe said she would \"learn from errors\" and \"adjust\" the system, which she admitted had problems, where needed.\n\nShe also rejected a UN report on UK poverty as \"extraordinarily political\".\n\nAnd she made clear that universal credit had an important role to play in reducing the number of workless families and tackling in-work poverty.\n\nThe ex-home secretary replaced Esther McVey on Friday after she quit over Brexit.\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she expected a change in tone from Ms Rudd and although not necessarily a major shift in policy.\n\nThe government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit - which replaces six working age benefits - by the end of 2023.\n\nBut the new system has been hit by delays and claims it is forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution.\n\nLabour has called for the next stage of the rollout - which will see 2.87 million people moved onto universal credit next summer - to be abandoned while the whole system is reconsidered.\n\n'Expert guidance'\n\nAnswering questions from MPs about her department's work, Ms Rudd was pressed by Tory Sir Desmond Swayne to ensure the changes were \"measured and continually improved\".\n\nShe replied: \"I share his view that it is vital as it is rolled out that we do learn from any errors, we do adjust it to make sure it properly serves the people it is intended to.\"\n\nMs Rudd said she would take heed of what campaigners have said about universal credit, following a call by 80 charities and other organisations for it to be halted.\n\nWhat is universal credit?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nUniversal credit is a benefit for working-age people.\n\nIt replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merge them into one payment:\n\nIt was designed to make claiming benefits simpler.\n\nA single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible.\n\nClaimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord).\n\nThe latest available figures show that there were 1.1 million universal credit claimants in August.\n\nThis makes up about half of all households claiming unemployment benefit, but only 10% of households claiming housing support and 2% of those claiming disability-related support.\n\n\"I am certainly going to be listening very carefully. Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years and we will certainly be doing that.\"\n\nBut Ms Rudd took issue with the findings of a report by the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty who claimed last week that ministers were in a \"state of denial\" about poverty levels.\n\nDespite the UK being one of the world's richest countries, Philip Alston said he had encountered \"misery\" during his 12-day tour.\n\nAsked about the report in the Commons, she said: \"We are not so proud that we don't think we can learn as we try to adjust to universal credit for the benefit of everybody, but that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying.\"\n\nThe government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK.\n\nMs McVey announced earlier this month that claimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit.\n\nAmong a number of other changes, she said they would not have to wait as long for their money and debt repayments would be reduced.\n\nIn the Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra \u00a31bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a \u00a31,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to \u00a31.7bn a year."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Jeremy Corbyn tells CBI business must act for 'common good'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46265560", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn says the government must \"change course or stand aside and let an election take place.\"\n\nLabour is not planning a \"war on business\", Jeremy Corbyn has insisted, as he told the CBI Brexit should be a catalyst for economic transformation.\n\nHe defended plans to give employees shares in their firms, saying despite the \"frenzied reaction\" in some quarters, it would \"strengthen\" them.\n\nThe \"rules of the game\" on boardroom pay and financial regulation needed to change to address inequality, he said.\n\nThe CBI said Labour should work with business, not seek to control it.\n\nLabour is committed to nationalising Royal Mail, the train operating companies, water firms in England and Wales and some parts of the energy network in a series of market interventions which the Conservatives have said will see borrowing increase by up to \u00a31 trillion.\n\nMr Corbyn told business leaders that the plans were part of a radical programme of \"industrial and economic renewal\" needed after years of under-investment and economic deregulation.\n\n\"Rigid and outdated\" economic thinking, he said, had contributed to widening inequality, with 20% of the country's wealth in the hands of only 1% of the population.\n\n'New settlement'\n\nThe UK's \"profoundly unbalanced economy\" had been a factor in the Brexit vote, he said, and the UK's departure from the EU must lead to \"real change\"\n\nBusiness must play its part in boosting productivity and ensuring prosperity was shared more equally, particularly in areas of the country that felt \"left behind\" in recent years.\n\nHe defended plans to force all large firms to put 1% of their share capital aside every year to give workers up to \u00a3500 in shares and to use the remainder to fund public services and welfare.\n\n\"Despite the frenzied reaction in certain sections of the press, there certainly is not any kind of war on business,\" he said of the plans. \"Actually it is the opposite, rather.\n\n\"We recognise the vast and vital contribution businesses make to our society and our economy and at the heart of that contribution are your employees.\n\n\"They have an interest in the long-term success of your company...Workers create profits.

It calculates that industrial emissions can be eradicated a cost of less than 1% of global GDP, with a marginal impact on living standards.\n\nThe ETC - a coalition of business, finance and civil society leaders from energy producers and users - supports the aim of the 2015 Paris climate deal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, or at the very least, well below 2C.\n\nIt sees benefits to society of cutting industrial emissions because this would save the costs associated with pollution and climate change impact.\n\nIt would also generate economic growth through technological innovation and increased productivity of resources.\n\nThe commission says this will require rapid improvements in energy efficiency across the whole economy.\n\nThis should be combined with vastly increased wind and solar electricity to power cars, vans, manufacturing, and a significant part of domestic cooking, heating and cooling.\n\nWhere are the biggest problems?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Steel is one of the industrial sectors targeted by the Energy Transitions Commission report\n\nThe focus of the report is on the tough nuts of climate change: cement, steel, chemicals, trucking and aviation.\n\nThese sectors account for close to a third of total global carbon dioxide emissions, but on current trends that is likely to increase just as the rest of the economy is cleaning up.\n\nThe report says it is technically possible to decarbonise all of them by the middle of the next century.\n\nIt recommends:\n\nMuch greater energy efficiency to boost progress in the 2020s, while more innovative technologies are still being developed\n\nDemand management to reduce demand for carbon-intensive products through smarter design and recycling\n\nCarbon capture and storage for the emissions that cannot be avoided from, say, the steel industry\n\nThe authors say we can decarbonise the difficult sectors at costs per tonne of carbon dioxide saved of $60 or less for steel, $120 or less in cement, and $270 or less in the case of plastics.\n\nIs there enough urgency?\n\nThe chair of the ETC, Adair Turner, said there was an \"incredible disconnect\" between the urgency of the climate problem and the \"glacial\" pace of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, where emissions are captured then pumped underground.\n\n\"Making the transition involves a step change in the way we do things,\" said the former CBI chief. \"It can be done and it won't break the bank ... but it will require real urgency from policy-makers, from business leaders and from investors and financiers.\"\n\nLord Turner admitted that having the climate change sceptic Donald Trump as US President was unhelpful.\n\nEnvironmentalists have applauded the ETC for laying out a possible pathway for emissions cuts, but are highly sceptical that the required level of urgency can be generated.\n\nThey note that the UK government, for instance, says it leads the world in climate policy, yet has just agreed a \u00a330bn road-building programme and a new runway for Heathrow, which will increase emissions.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Workers install photovoltaic panels at a farm in Zhangjiakou in China's Hebei province.\n\nKevin Anderson, a professor of economics at Manchester University, points out that the UK's proud record of carbon emission cuts does not count statistics on key polluting sectors.\n\n\"If we include CO2 from international aviation; shipping; imports and exports - then UK plc has made no real dent in CO2 since 1990, nor have the other climate-progressive EU nations.\n\n\"Until we dispense with our rose-tinted specs we'll not even recognise the problem - let alone the solutions.

Monday's procurement represents two of only seven big platforms that have been openly competed globally in 2018.\n\nNicolas Chamussy, the director of space systems at Airbus, said he thought the market would bounce back eventually, and that Neo especially would prove popular as operators started to overhaul their ageing fleets.\n\n\"This new-generation platform is of extreme importance because it is the inception of a new product.

This type of propulsion system, which produces thrust by accelerating atoms of xenon through a nozzle, is highly efficient. Much less fuel is carried on a mission in comparison with the needs of established chemical thrusters.\n\nThe savings in weight and volume can either be used to pack in more payload and performance, or to produce a lighter platform that can ride a smaller, cheaper rocket to orbit.\n\nIn the case of the new Hotbirds, they will go to the launchpad in 2021 weighing 4.5 tonnes each. Without electric propulsion they would easily top six tonnes.\n\nAirbus says the new modular design of the satellites means their production timelines can also be trimmed, from 30 months to 24 months.\n\nThe development of the new spacecraft architecture was supported by Esa's Artes programme which aims to find the technologies to keep European manufacturers competitive on the world stage.\n\nImage copyright AIRBUS Image caption Sam Gyimah (C) is flanked by Rodolphe Belmer (R) and Nicolas Chamussy (L)\n\nThe UK is the member-state that makes the largest contribution to this agency programme, investing \u20ac500m over the period 2016-2021.\n\nSix of Eutelsat's next seven spacecraft are bing built in Britain, which includes another Esa-Artes-inspired project called Quantum. This will be a \"software defined\" telecoms satellite, meaning its coverage, bandwidth, power and frequency can all be reprogrammed from the ground. This flexibility will enable Eutelsat to move Quantum to a different part of the globe and service its markets, instead of launching another bespoke satellite.\n\nEutelsat CEO Rodolphe Belmer commented: \"We continue to be hugely impressed by the expansion of the UK space sector, particularly its growing industrial capabilities, the development of cutting-edge technology, and the quality of the people working in the sector.\"\n\nScience Minister, Sam Gyimah, was present at the Airbus-Eutelsat contract signing in London.

That was a mystery,\" Georgia Institute of Technology's Patricia Yang said.\n\nAfter studying the digestive tracts of wombats put down after road accidents in Tasmania, a team led by Ms Yang presented its findings at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics' annual meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\"We opened those intestines up like it was Christmas,\" said co-author David Hu, also from Georgia Tech, according to Science News.\n\nThe team compared the wombat intestines to pig intestines by inserting a balloon into the animals' digestive tracts to see how it stretched to fit the balloon.\n\nIn wombats, the faeces changed from a liquid-like state into a solid state in the last 25% of the intestines - but then in the final 8% a varied elasticity of the walls meant the poop would take shape as separated cubes.\n\nThis, the scientists explain, resulted in 2cm (0.8in) cube-shaped poops unique to wombats and the natural world.\n\nThe marsupial then stacks the cubes - the higher the better so as to communicate with and attract other wombats.\n\n\"We currently have only two methods to manufacture cubes: We mould it, or we cut it. Now we have this third method,\" Ms Yang said.\n\n\"It would be a cool method to apply to the manufacturing process,\" she suggested, \"how to make a cube with soft tissue instead of just moulding it.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Kilogram gets a new definition", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46143399", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright SPL Image caption There are now discrepancies between copies of the kilogram and the master version held in a French vault\n\nScientists have changed the way the kilogram is defined.\n\nCurrently, it is defined by the weight of a platinum-based ingot called \"Le Grand K\" which is locked away in a safe in Paris.\n\nOn Friday, researchers meeting in Versailles voted to get rid of it in favour of defining a kilogram in terms of an electric current.\n\nThe decision was made at the General Conference on Weights and Measures.\n\nBut some scientists, such as Perdi Williams at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, have expressed mixed feelings about the change.\n\n\"I haven't been on this project for too long but I feel a weird attachment to the kilogram,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it is such an exciting thing and this is a really big moment. So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Woman Amazed She Found Perfect Partner Just When She Was Getting Desperate Enough To Accept Anything", "article_link": "https://local.theonion.com/woman-amazed-she-found-perfect-partner-just-when-she-wa-1830541888", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "ELKINS PARK, PA\u2014Saying that \u201cthe universe works in mysterious ways,\u201d local woman Rebecca Ellis claimed Monday to be amazed at how she found the perfect partner just when she was getting desperate enough to accept anything. \u201cWho would have thought I\u2019d find the most perfect guy for me at almost the same instant I lowered my standards to a level I\u2019d once have found unthinkable?

It had been done before, many times. In fact, over the past two years, Israel had been successful in carrying out two high-profile covert operations, assassinating Hamas drone expert Mohammed al-Zawari in Tunisia in December 2016 and engineer and scholar Fadi al-Batsh in Malaysia in April 2018.\n\nBut the Israeli intelligence operation on November 11 in Gaza did not go according to plan. Hamas intercepted it in its early stages, attacking the Israeli commandoes and pursuing them as they tried to flee the strip under the cover of heavy air attacks by Israeli jets. Seven Palestinians were killed in the botched operation, including a prominent al-Qassam Brigades commander, Nour Baraka, and one Israeli officer - an unnamed lieutenant colonel.\n\nHamas responded by firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, some intercepted by the Iron Dome, others landing in civilian areas, killing one Israeli civilian and injuring dozens of others. Its military wing went as far as targeting an Israeli military bus with a Kornet rocket, a Russian anti-tank guided missile; it was the first time it had used such weapons since the 2014 Gaza war.\n\nThe Israeli government also launched days-long air raids on Gaza, bombing civilian buildings and killing five Palestinians, but it could not repair the political damage that had been done.\n\nHamas was victorious. A video of the Kornet attack was widely circulated in Arab and Israeli media; Palestinians in Gaza started saying \"the Kornet defeated the cabinet\".\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had little space for manoeuvre: he was forced to settle for a ceasefire with Gaza armed groups, which prompted Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman to resign and plunged his government into a major political crisis.\n\nThis time, provoking a new conflict in Gaza in order to take attention away from the domestic political mess he has made is not an option for Netanyahu. He is cornered by a resurgent Hamas and his own geopolitical game in the Middle East, so he needs to keep Gaza quiet.\n\nA stronger Hamas\n\nThe Israeli government has insisted that the November 11 operation was not supposed to be an assassination mission, but has not provided further details. Analysts have argued that it was an intelligence gathering operation which was not meant to \"trigger a new war\".\n\nRegardless of what Netanyahu wanted to achieve, the only outcome of the botched operation was a win for Hamas. It not only proved the capabilities of its own intelligence - which managed to uncover the Israeli plot early on - but also demonstrated the weaknesses of the Israeli intelligence apparatus, which, while able to carry out complex operations abroad, is ironically failing in neighbouring Gaza.\n\nThis was not the first time that an intelligence operation had gone terribly wrong under Netanyahu's watch. In 1997, he signed off on an assassination attempt against Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, who at that time was residing in Jordan. After the two Israeli agents, who were supposed to inject him with poison, were caught and beaten up by Meshaal's bodyguard, a major diplomatic crisis erupted between Israel and Jordan, forcing the Israeli intelligence to hand in the antidote.\n\nAlthough Netanyahu was cleared of any wrongdoing in a subsequent domestic investigation, the botched operation contributed to his massive defeat in the general elections two years later.\n\nThe assassination attempt in 1997 was a win for Hamas, and so was the November 11 failed operation. It has allowed the resistance movement to consolidate its political gains domestically and internationally and demonstrate its military strength.\n\nIt has also made evident the fact that Israel's decade-old blockade of Gaza has done little to weaken Hamas or the resolve of the Palestinian people to resist. Keeping two million people in \"the biggest open-air prison\" in the world for more than 10 years is not an effective \"pacifying\" tool.\n\nWith a stronger Hamas and a population determined to resist, another war in Gaza would be an even greater disaster for the Israeli government and Netanyahu is well-aware of that. Therefore, after a few days of air attacks on the strip, he had to seek a ceasefire.\n\nThe Iran problem\n\nThere was also another reason why the Israeli prime minister risked the collapse of his government to maintain calm with Gaza: Iran.\n\nNetanyahu's top regional priority is countering Iran and its allies with whatever means possible. Keeping Gaza \"conflict-free\" allows him to curb Iranian influence in the strip and focus his attention on his larger project of confronting Iran in the rest of the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister is seeking to solidify an anti-Iran front in the Middle East by establishing an alliance with the Arab Gulf states - mainly Saudi Arabia - and the United States and pursuing what has come to be known as \"the ultimate deal\".\n\nThis \"deal\" envisions forcing some form of territorial solution for the Palestinian issue onto the Palestinian leadership and full normalisation of relations with Arab states, with the aim of isolating Iran even further in the region. Over the past few months, Netanyahu has upped the ante on normalisation efforts, paying a visit last month to Oman, which traditionally had enjoyed good relations with Iran.\n\nThe latest Gaza ceasefire should be seen within this context. Over the past year, Egypt - under US patronage - has made extensive efforts to broker a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel as part of the \"ultimate deal\". Calming down the situation after the recent escalation was meant to salvage the progress Cairo had made in that direction.\n\nNetanyahu is also eager to keep Gaza quiet because he is feeling increasingly anxious about countering Iranian presence in Israel's immediate neighbourhood - Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe downing of a Russian military plane over Syria in September complicated relations with Russia, which until then had allowed the Israeli Air Force to target Iranian facilities at will.\n\nAs a result, Russian-Israeli military coordination in Syria is no longer and while Israel still does occasional air attacks, Russia is no longer making it easy for its fighter jets.\n\nThe Israeli government is also increasingly wary of Iran's presence in Lebanon, which could strengthen the military capabilities of Hezbollah.\n\nAlthough Israel scored another gain against Iran when the US re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil earlier this month, it has also suffered a major setback in the aftermath of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The uncertainty surrounding the fate of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - seen as seriously committed to normalisation with Israel - has worried Netanyahu. This has further motivated him to seek some form of a settlement with Hamas.\n\nIn this sense, Israel will continue to search for a long-term truce with Hamas as long as the project of confronting Iran remains on the table. For this reason, another full-fledged conflict in Gaza in the near future is unlikely.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Three Democratic US Senators Sue to Challenge Whitaker Appointment", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/two-democratic-us-senators-sue-to-challenge-whitaker-appointment/4664995.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Three Democratic senators launched a new legal challenge on Monday to President Donald Trump's naming of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, accusing Trump of depriving the U.S. Senate of its constitutional power to act on such appointments.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington by Senators Richard Blumenthal, Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator Mazie Hirono, all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that customarily reviews attorney general nominations.\n\nCongressional Democrats have expressed concern that Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, could undermine or even fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation of Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency.\n\n\"Americans prize a system of checks and balances, which President Trump's dictatorial appointment betrays,\" Blumenthal said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused Trump of violating a federal law that establishes the line of succession if the attorney general post becomes vacant \u2014 giving full authority to the deputy attorney general \u2014 and rejected the Justice Department's legal reasoning in its support of the Republican president's action.\n\nWhitaker took over supervision of Mueller's investigation when Trump appointed him on November 7 as the chief U.S. law enforcement official to replace Jeff Sessions, who the president ousted.

Out!\" referring to the migrant caravan that arrived in the border city last week.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road _ and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nSome Tijuana residents supported the migrants, but others accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \"invasion.\" And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\"We don't want them in Tijuana,\" protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants.

The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \"We are fleeing violence,\" said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \"How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\"\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S.\n\nEdwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain.

Mora lays out a future scenario in which in 2100 New York will be constantly dealing with the potentially devastating effects of four different climate hazards, including extreme weather and sea level rise.\n\nAll of these effects are measurable and in the future a city like Miami might be dealing with drought, extreme heat, sea level rise and more numerous and more powerful hurricanes. \"Any coastal area in the tropics is going to be on fire\" Mora says. Sydney, Los Angeles, Brazil and Mexico City are all at risk as the effects of climate change stack up.\"\n\nMora's study is impressive in its detail, noting, \"Planes can\u2019t fly during heat waves ... wires short circuit during heat waves,\" Mora says. And for people who work outdoors it can literally get too hot and \"their livelihoods depend on their job ability to work out doors.\"\n\nAll of these impacts add up and have a profound economic effect. Mora says they create stressed communities that have less economic ability to deal with change, plus higher financial costs thanks to the infrastructure damage and repair associated with predicted extreme weather events.\n\nIs it too late?\n\nBut despite all of the bad news in this assessment, Mora is bullish on our ability to head off the effects of climate change.\n\n\"This is not game over,\" he says. \"We are not too late to turn this around and we have pathways to reduce emissions what we need to do is implement them.\"\n\nMora says the solution to the world's carbon problem will not come from the world's leaders, despite agreements like the Paris Accord for which hundreds of the world's leaders came together to commit to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHe says the real change to mitigate climate change through gradual cutting of emissions will come from the public, and he points to efforts like Hawaii's decision to become a carbon neutral state by 2045 and to shift to 100 percent renewable energy.\n\nMora is also involved with tree planting efforts in Hawaii that he says if done worldwide could help the planet actually remove carbon from the atmosphere, not just stop putting it in.

Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution. Nuon Chea was considered the main ideologist of the Khmer Rouge and the right-hand man of the group\u2019s late leader, Pol Pot, while Khieu Samphan served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nMembers of the Cham community were among the large crowd of spectators who attended Friday\u2019s session.\n\nThe court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for insuffient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u201cauto-genocide\u201d through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nOne of the spectators at Friday\u2019s hearing was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed by the Khmer Rouge, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that the both Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Missing North Carolina Teacher Was Killed In Mexico By Drug Trafficker: Governor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patrick-braxton-andrew-killed-mexico_us_5bf2d23ae4b0b84243e494c8", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "A North Carolina high school teacher reported missing in Mexico last month was murdered by a local drug trafficker, authorities said, ending a desperate weeks-long search by his family and friends.\n\nThe man, Patrick Braxton-Andrew, 34, taught Spanish at a private school in Mooresville, about 30 miles north of Charlotte.

It certainly seems so, despite a lot of smoke and bluff from her detractors.\n\nFor starters, it is dawning on the newly elected House Democrats, most of whom are progressives, that the hardcore anti-Pelosi opposition is comprised of men who want to push the party to the center.\n\nThe hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys nicely sums up what\u2019s at work. The white guys in question are Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Tim Ryan of Ohio, Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Bill Foster of Illinois. They want a party that has more appeal to the middle.\n\nBut the 2018 election was all about grassroots energy, women\u2019s leadership and Democrats running as pocketbook progressives flipping House seats. So, why would the Democratic caucus want to displace a leader who is effective and progressive, as well as female?\n\nAnyone who closely follows House politics knows that Pelosi is the most skilled Democratic leader since Tip O\u2019Neill, maybe even better. That\u2019s why the Republicans keep demonizing her.\n\nPelosi was brilliant holding the caucus together under President Barack Obama to get the Affordable Care Act passed, and even more brilliant in opposition, making sure the Republican Congress didn\u2019t kill it. She was superb at organizing the caucus last year so that not a single Democrat broke ranks and voted for the Trump tax bill, as dozens had voted for Bush and Reagan tax cuts.\n\nPelosi was also masterful at keeping Democratic House candidates focused on bread-and-butter issues such as health care, prescription drug costs, Social Security, jobs and wages, and making sure that Democrats did not fall into the Trump trap of leading with identity politics.\n\nThanks to this strategy, not only did at least 37 Democrats flip Republican House seats \u2015 many of them in improbable places \u2015 but several African Americans took Republican seats in majority white districts by staying focused on pocketbook issues. When the history of Trump\u2019s downfall is written, one of the most dramatic and ennobling aspects of November 2018 as a turning point will be the fact that several Trump districts voted for black progressives for Congress.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi movement is a mashup of opportunism on the part of a few wannabe leaders, such as Moulton and Ryan, combined with a dose of ageism, sexism and defensive tactical moves by a few Democrats who won in conservative districts. There are 10 incoming freshmen who felt they had to take the Republicans\u2019 Pelosi attacks off the table during their campaigns by pledging not to support her.\n\nBut this past week, Pelosi demonstrated just how astute a politician she is. She understands the desire for a generational shift and for younger members to assume more leadership positions.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who is expected to co-chair the House Progressive Caucus next year, met with Pelosi and won a commitment that caucus members would have more seats on major committees. Jayapal, previously uncommitted, gave Pelosi a full endorsement. She described the centrist effort to displace Pelosi as \u201cthe opposite of what the election really told us.\u201d\n\nThe end game of this farce will come in two parts. The first will come on Nov. 28, when Democrats elect their new leader. Pelosi will likely win this vote overwhelmingly.\n\nThen on Jan. 3 comes the vote for speaker. The 10 newly elected House Democrats, in theory, could be joined by the swath of centrist incumbents who have previously said they will not support Pelosi. That adds up to more than 20 Democrats who have said they will not support Pelosi.\n\nIf you work out that arithmetic statically, and assume that Democrats eventually have 233 or 234 seats, the defection of all those declared against her would leave Pelosi short of the 218 she presumably needs to be elected speaker. But that\u2019s not how this is likely to play out.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, arrives for the House Democrats' caucus meeting in the Capitol on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.\n\nAfter Pelosi is overwhelmingly elected as Democratic leader, the pressure will be immense on wavering members not to allow a Republican to be elected speaker. And even if several vote against Pelosi, or vote present, she can be elected speaker with fewer than 218 votes.\n\nThis has happened before. In 2015, John Boehner was elected speaker with 216 votes. So was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nLet\u2019s say that Democrats end up with 234 seats and Republicans with 201. It\u2019s inconceivable that anti-Pelosi Democrats would vote to make Republican leader Kevin McCarthy the speaker. The greater likelihood is that Democrats opposed to Pelosi will vote present. Assume that 20 Democrats vote present and all Republicans vote for McCarthy. Pelosi still wins 214 votes, to McCarthy\u2019s 201, and becomes the next speaker.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi forces hope that a bandwagon effect creates a groundswell of support for some other candidate and Pelosi will step aside before the vote. Their problem is that the bandwagon is going in the opposite direction, as Pelosi solidifies her support.\n\nThe other problem is that there isn\u2019t anyone else with Pelosi\u2019s stature, skill, or popularity in the caucus. The only member who has announced a possible run for the job is Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio\u2019s 11th District.

(Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nBy DAVID EGGERT, Associated Press\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 With their grip on power set to loosen come January, Republicans in several states are considering last-ditch laws that would weaken existing or incoming Democratic governors and advance their own conservative agendas.\n\nIn Michigan, where the GOP has held the levers of power for nearly eight years, Republican legislators want to water down a minimum wage law they approved before the election so that it would not go to voters and would now be easier to amend.\n\nRepublicans in neighboring Wisconsin are discussing ways to dilute Democrat Tony Evers\u2019 power before he takes over for GOP Gov. Scott Walker. And in North Carolina, Republicans may try to hash out the requirements of a new voter ID constitutional amendment before they lose their legislative supermajorities and their ability to unilaterally override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\nRepublicans downplay the tactics and point out that Democrats have also run lame-duck sessions, including in Wisconsin in 2010 before Walker took office and the GOP took control of the Legislature. But some of the steps Republicans are expected to take will almost surely be challenged in court, and critics say such maneuvers undermine the political system and the will of the people, who voted for change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that smacks every Michigan voter in the face and tells them that this Republican Party doesn\u2019t care about their voice, their perspective,\u201d House Democratic Leader Sam Singh said of the strategizing to control the fate of minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.\n\nThe moves would follow midterm elections in which Democrats swept statewide offices in Michigan and Wisconsin for the first time in decades but fell short of taking over their gerrymandered legislatures. That gives Republicans a final shot to lock in new policies, with Democrats unable to undo them anytime soon.\n\nMichigan\u2019s new minimum wage and sick time laws began as ballot drives but because they were preemptively adopted by lawmakers in September rather than by voters, they can be altered with simple majority votes rather than the support of three-fourths of both chambers.\n\nOne measure would gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and increase a lower wage for tipped workers until it is in line with the minimum. The other would require that employees qualify for between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave, depending on the size of their employer.\n\nIt is unclear how the laws may be changed to appease an anxious business lobby. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce says mandatory sick time \u2014 10 other states also require it \u2014 will place \u201csevere compliance burdens\u201d on employers, including those with paid leave policies in place currently. The group also is urging lawmakers to \u201cbe pragmatic, not extreme\u201d and revisit the wage hikes that would make Michigan\u2019s minimum the highest in the Midwest.\n\nRepublicans seem unfazed by criticism that scaling back the measures would thwart the will of voters who resoundingly elected Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to replace GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, who reached his term limit. The Michigan Senate\u2019s majority leader, Arlan Meekhof, said changes to the laws are needed to \u201ccontinue to keep our economy on track and not put a roadblock or hindrance\u201d in the way of businesses.\n\nLame-duck sessions, which are commonplace in Congress but rare among many state legislatures, are frenetic, as legislators rush to consider bills that are controversial or were put on the backburner during election season. Michigan\u2019s 2012 session, for example, produced right-to-work laws and a contentious revised emergency manager statute for cities in financial peril, despite voters having just repealed the previous law.\n\nThe lame-duck period may be especially intense this year in Michigan and Wisconsin because they are among just four states in which Republicans are losing full control the governorship and both legislative chambers. Lawmakers in the other two states, Kansas and New Hampshire, will not convene until next year.\n\nSix states with a split government now will be fully controlled by Democrats in 2019, and Alaska will be fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nWisconsin Republicans plan to consider a variety of ways to protect laws enacted by Walker\ufeff. Those include limiting Evers\u2019 ability to make appointments, restricting his authority over the rule-making process and making it more difficult for him to block a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. They might also change the date of the 2020 presidential primary so that a Walker-appointed state Supreme Court justice has better odds to win election.\n\nIn North Carolina, GOP legislators may use the session for more than approving additional bipartisan Hurricane Florence relief. They are expected to implement a voter photo ID requirement passed this month by the electorate and to consider other legislation that the Democratic governor would be powerless to stop until Republicans can no longer easily override his vetoes come 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, they reduced Cooper\u2019s powers before he took office. He successfully sued over a law that diminished his role in managing elections. Other suits remain pending.\n\nMichigan\u2019s outgoing governor, Snyder, hasn\u2019t weighed in on the plan to amend the minimum wage and sick leave laws, which would require his signature, unlike when they were passed. He is trying to persuade his fellow Republicans to boost and add new fees for environmental cleanup and water infrastructure upgrades, and he wants the Legislature to help facilitate a deal to drill an oil pipeline tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac. The agreement is opposed by Whitmer and the state\u2019s Democratic Attorney General-elect, Dana Nessel.\n\nSupporters of the existing wage and sick time laws have been mobilizing to keep them intact. MI Time to Care \u2014 the campaign backing guaranteed paid time off for workers who are sick or need to stay home with an ill family member \u2014 launched ads, mailed postcards and went door to door before the election reminding people of their rights under the law that is scheduled to take effect in March.\n\nChairwoman Danielle Atkinson said the sick leave proposal would have been approved in a \u201clandslide\u201d if it had been on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly why the Legislature moved to pass it, and now they should uphold it as the promise that they made to the voters,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wis., and Gary Robertson in Raleigh, N.C., contributed to this report.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Carl Bernstein: Media Should Rethink Coverage Of Trump\u2019s \u2018Propagandist\u2019 Press Conferences", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carl-bernstein-white-house-press-briefings_us_5bf2b4e6e4b075738820814a", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Veteran journalist Carl Bernstein on Sunday urged cable news networks to reconsider live broadcasts of President Donald Trump\u2019s press conferences, denouncing them as \u201cpropagandist exercises\u201d packed with \u201cdishonesty and lying.\u201d\n\nBernstein, famously part of the duo of reporters who unearthed the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post during the Nixon administration, scolded the media for treating the president\u2019s press conferences and briefings as \u201ccampaign\u201d rallies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be taping them live all the time and just pasting them up on there because they\u2019re basically propagandist exercises, because they are overwhelmed by [Trump\u2019s] dishonesty and lying,\u201d Bernstein said during an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d\n\n.@carlbernstein's thoughts on how the media should cover Trump\u2019s events: \"I don't think we should be taking them live all the time and just pasting them up on the air because they're basically just propagandist exercises\u2026\" pic.twitter.com/JHPGlPCBSo \u2014 Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) November 18, 2018\n\nBernstein, a frequent critic of the Trump administration, suggested media outlets continue to attend Trump\u2019s press conferences, but \u201cedit\u201d and \u201cdecide as reporters what is news.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can put up the total press conference on our website so that everybody has the chance to see it,\u201d Bernstein continued. \u201cBut we need to start editing.

Researchers hope to gather tens of thousands of responses from drug users in the U.S., which they\u2019ll use to promote safer habits and inform future debates around drug policy.\n\nThe surveys are conducted anonymously. Go here for more information on how respondents\u2019 data is used.\n\nThe Global Drug Survey is an independent research company that, since 2012, has partnered with medical experts and media groups to distribute and analyze a yearly questionnaire. Previous editions have compiled more than half a million responses from respondents in dozens of countries.\n\nThe resulting data has provided valuable insights into drug use habits. The 2017 survey showed that hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD were among the safest recreational drugs. In 2018, it revealed that a relatively large percentage of marijuana users around the world report signs of dependence.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey touches on a number of topics that are particularly relevant to Americans, said Adam Winstock, the British psychiatrist and addiction researcher who created the Global Drug Survey.\n\nThe survey includes questions about legal marijuana markets, with a particular focus on the growing popularity of cannabis edibles, which are more popular in the U.S. than anywhere, said Winstock. It will also look at consumer responses to warning labels on recreational weed products. With 10 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., now having legalized marijuana, it\u2019s important for officials to have solid data to work with when crafting rules and regulations associated with commercial sales, said Winstock.\n\nThe 2019 Global Drug Survey also asks a number of questions about sexual assault and drug use. Winstock said it was a natural topic to explore amid the Me Too movement, which has led to numerous claims against men who have allegedly sexually mistreated women.

Clinical trials are currently underway to probe the use of MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and LSD in treating a variety of conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety related to terminal illness, substance addiction and depression.\n\nAlthough early studies have suggested that these psychedelic drugs could have promising therapeutic applications, Winstock said he wants to know how receptive the general public would be to such an alternative treatment method.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good running a small clinical trial with a bunch of people who\u2019ve got a defined mental illness, but how the wider population would feel about going into a clinic and snorting ketamine as part of their treatment, or going in and having an intense psychedelic experience to deal with their mental health, I just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Winstock."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Florida Sues Walgreens, CVS, Alleging They Added To State's Opioid Crisis", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-sues-walgreens-cvs-over-opioids_us_5bf1ab4ee4b07573881f714d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Most of the opioids would then be taken out of state to be resold illegally at huge markups, creating a drug crisis in many communities throughout the Eastern United States.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Walgreens has dispensed billions of opioid dosages from its Florida pharmacies since 2006. The Illinois-based chain is the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chain and has more than 13,200 stores globally.\n\nThe company distributed 2.2 million opioid tablets from its store in Hudson, a Tampa-area town of 12,000, and in one unidentified town of 3,000, sold 285,000 pills in a month, the lawsuit says. In some stores, its opioid sales jumped six-fold in two years.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u2019s Chairman, Is Arrested Over Financial Misconduct", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/nissan-carlos-ghosn-misconduct.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "TOKYO \u2014 The Nissan chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested on Monday after an internal company investigation found that he had underreported his compensation to the Japanese financial authorities for several years.\n\nNissan said it was cooperating with Japanese prosecutors.

In interviews, she has audaciously declared herself to be a \u201cmaster legislator\u201d; issued policy statements on behalf of the Democratic caucus; and implicitly dared any challenger to make themselves known while also quelling opposition to her speakership by hinting in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in October that she was open to being a \u201ctransitional figure.\u201d When I asked Pelosi about this olive branch two weeks later, however, she abruptly walked it back: \u201cI think every leader is a transitional figure.\u201d\n\nHer torrid October schedule, spanning more than two dozen cities, involved meeting with candidates whose victories on Nov. 6 were mostly all but assured, while taking care to avoid hotly contested races where the presence of one of the least popular and most reliably demonized figures in American politics might cost a Democrat votes. Pelosi had spent the previous day in Arizona, rallying volunteers and donors on behalf of Ann Kirkpatrick \u2014 a candidate who, then seven points ahead of her Republican opponent in internal polls, didn\u2019t really need Pelosi\u2019s help. But Kirkpatrick had publicly stated that she would vote for Pelosi as speaker, and Pelosi was offering a display of gratitude. And no doubt when the time came for Kirkpatrick to ask for a plum committee assignment \u2014 the Appropriations Committee happened to be her first choice \u2014 the speaker would be only too happy to demonstrate what loyalty got you with Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\u201cShe is, in my view, the best speaker I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Obey, the cantankerous former Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who served under eight different speakers, including Pelosi, over the course of his 42-year congressional career. \u201cShe understands her caucus, and she doesn\u2019t run it like a San Francisco liberal. She runs it by trying to find its center of gravity. She works harder than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen, and I think she has more determination to stand for something than anybody I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Obey whether such skills were of any use in negotiating with a president like Trump, he acknowledged with a grunt, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s damn near an impossible task for anybody to work with him. But to the extent that it\u2019s possible, she\u2019s the one who would have the best chance. If Trump plays that game of agreeing to something and then backing off, she has the talent to unify her caucus so that they have a unified message to take to the American people \u2014 because in cases like that, only the American people can set matters straight.\u201d\n\nPelosi is something of a paradox in the world of politics. A Gallup poll five months ago found her favorability rating to be at a dismal 29 percent, and yet \u2014 unlike other unpopular political figures such as Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2014 her 31 years in public life have been free of scandal. She has been excoriated from the right as the quintessence of California limousine liberalism. But she is also a practicing Catholic whose first career was as a stay-at-home mother of five children, with little in common with \u2014 and at times little patience for \u2014 the new generation of activists in her party, to whom she sometimes refers as \u201cthe lefties.\u201d Pelosi \u2014 who with her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, owns a large house in San Francisco\u2019s upper-crust Presidio Heights as well as a Napa Valley vineyard \u2014 is indeed rich. But 29 members of Congress, 18 of them Republicans, are richer.\n\nWhat sets her apart from other legislators of her stature is her gender. Pelosi has been known to say: \u201cNo one gives you power.

A joint project between Duke and Yale\u2019s Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science, published this fall in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research, found that when certain popular flavors are added to a common solvent in the vaping liquids, they produce chemicals that irritate airways and lungs. A 2016 study in the journal Chest said that smoking e-cigarettes had an effect on the heart and arteries which, while was not as pronounced as that of combustible cigarettes, was still distinctive.\n\nImage The e-cigarettes are extremely discreet, making them particularly popular among high school and even middle school students.

Between the cost of the ride service plus the Juul \u201cstarter\u201d kit, he spent $100 to sate his need.\n\nSoon, he escalated to a daily pod, sometimes more.

Users inhale and exhale the vapor. The devices come in numerous shapes, including ones that look like pens, flash drives and hookahs. Many consumers are confused about the health implications of e-cigarettes. This is a primer about what research so far shows about these devices.\n\nAre they safer than traditional cigarettes?\n\nYes. But that does not mean they are safe.\n\nE-cigarettes contain far fewer dangerous chemicals than those released in burning tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes typically contain 7,000 chemicals, including nearly 70 known to be carcinogenic. E-cigarettes also don\u2019t release tar, the tobacco residue that damages lungs but also contributes to the flavor of tobacco products. In the United States, cigarettes are associated with 480,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease, stroke and numerous cancers, among other illnesses.\n\nThe research on e-cigarettes is young because the products have only been around for a little over a decade. Exacerbated by the voltage of a given device, certain e-cigarette flavors can irritate the airways, researchers say: benzaldehyde (added to cherry flavored liquids), cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon flavor), and diacetyl (a buttery flavor that can cause lung tissue damage called \u201cpopcorn lung.\u201d) Some flavors become irritants when added to vaping liquids. The process of turning liquid chemicals into vapor releases harmful particulates deep into the lungs and atmosphere, including heavy metals."}]
