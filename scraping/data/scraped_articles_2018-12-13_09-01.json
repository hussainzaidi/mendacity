Sharp-eyed readers may have noticed the shift. Instead of covers that celebrated Trump and attacked his enemies, the Enquirer has been sticking with tried-and-true stories about celebrity scandals.\n\nIn other words, the Enquirer stopped being a part of Trump's promotional media machine.\n\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., is controlled by David Pecker \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump's.\n\nAmerican Media Inc. declined to comment on the cover choices on Wednesday.\n\nBut the change came at the same time when prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York zeroed in on Michael Cohen's financial dealings with Pecker and American Media. It has now been established that Cohen worked with Pecker to set up a $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal before the 2016 election. The payment effectively silenced her, ensuring that her claims of an affair with Trump would not be made public.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign-finance violations relating to McDougal and Stormy Daniels.\n\n(Trump has denied having affairs with both McDougal and Daniels.)\n\nBut the revelations about the payments started to strain the Trump-Enquirer relationship many months ago.\n\nIn June, the Wall Street Journal reported that the prosecutors had subpoenaed records from the National Enquirer as part of the Cohen probe.\n\nBy then, the Trump-related covers had already stopped appearing.\n\nThis was a big change for the Enquirer. In 2016, anti-Hillary Clinton covers were a steady part of the Enquirer's campaign coverage. Distorted and exaggerated stories about Clinton controversies had the added effect of pumping up Trump's candidacy. After all, The Enquirer has always had prime placement at supermarkets.\n\nOne pre-election cover even promised an \"explosive\" anti-Clinton story \"that will change the election.\"\n\nThe anti-Clinton covers continued into 2017, joined by headlines that portrayed Trump as a resolute hero standing up to Clinton, Barack Obama, the FBI and other so-called enemies.\n\nAs recently as March 19, 2018, the cover said, \"Surrounded by traitors!: Donald & Melania fight back!\" The headline was subtitled, \"Exposing the lies, leaks, & intimidation\" and \"How they'll crush their enemies!\"\n\nIn April, the FBI raided Cohen's office, seizing documents and email related to Daniels. That same month, AMI released McDougal from a contract that kept her from talking about her alleged affair with Trump.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, the cover was devoted to tearing down Cohen, which is noteworthy in light of the later revelations about Cohen and Pecker's collaboration.\n\n\"Trump fixer's secrets and lies!,\" read the headline. A small photo of Cohen appeared next to a big photo of Trump. The banner above them said, \"payoffs and threats exposed.\"\n\nAnd that was it. The cover headlines about Trump suddenly stopped.\n\nIt is possible that the Trump-promoting covers simply stopped being a reader draw. The Enquirer is famously reactive to circulation trends, with editors who pay very close attention to which cover subjects sell more copies than others. But the timeline matches up exactly to the federal investigation.\n\nSince May, only one story on the Enquirer's web site has been tagged with Trump's name, and it was about a past contestant on the \"Celebrity Apprentice\" television show.\n\nSo the president has lost one of his friendliest news sources \u2014 a magazine that previously propped him up and promoted his candidacy and presidency.\n\nHe appears to have lost a friend, as well. Pecker has declined to comment on Trump, but prosecutors said on Wednesday that American Media Inc. has helped with the investigation into Cohen.\n\nThis confirmed reports dating back to August that Pecker had been granted immunity. Numerous headlines have portrayed Pecker and the Enquirer as \"flipping\" on Trump.\n\nThe Southern District of New York said in a statement on Wednesday that its office \"has agreed not to prosecute AMI for its role\" in the $150,000 payment, as long as the company continues to cooperate.\n\nA spokesman for the tabloid declined to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump 'seething' after Cohen sentencing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RBwpWRnkk5M/trump-seething-cohen-sentencing-jim-acosta-dnt-tsr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "President Trump's public silence belied his rising fury over longtime lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who the President still insists is not telling the truth, after he turned against him and was sentenced to three years in prison.

But inevitably, it's going to spill over into other areas, and I think the more national security is tied up in this, the more difficult it will be to reach an agreement.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's top national security official told lawmakers on Wednesday the administration is reacting to China's \"steadily increasing\" economic espionage activity, which costs the US an estimated $225 billion a year.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2018, more than 90% of the DOJ's cases alleging economic espionage by a state have involved China, and more than two-thirds of trade secret thefts have a nexus to China, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said.\n\n\"From underwater drones and autonomous vehicles to critical chemical compounds and inbred corn seeds, China has targeted advanced technology across sectors that align with China's publicly announced strategic goals,\" Demers said. \"The play book is simple: rob, replicate and replace.\"\n\n'Rob, replicate and replace'\n\n\"Rob American companies of information technology, replicate and replace that American company in the Chinese market and then the global market,\" Demers outlined.\n\nUS prosecutions of the cases began in 2014 as the department prioritized the crimes.\n\n\"We've been able to bring a number of cases because the activity is tremendous and the grounds for those cases is very fertile,\" Demers said.\n\nBeijing's espionage focus is clear, Demers said, pointing to a 10-year strategic plan China published in 2015 that outlined 10 advanced technology industries for development.\n\n\"What they're telling us overtly is where they want to lead the world\" in areas they believe will be the future of technology, Demers said. \"What they deny ritually, openly, is that they're also using illegal means to advance their development goals.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Inside the US-China rivalry Replay More Videos ...

Instead, it is now \"relying today on people from all walks of life to carry out their aims,\" Priestap said.\n\n\"They have a great ability to lean on people -- some who are witting, some who are not witting -- in their society to carry out their aims. Whether they be researchers, scientists, students, businessmen, otherwise tourists, the Chinese intelligence services don't hesitate to ask those people to carry out their aims,\" Priestap said.\n\nNo demonizing\n\nThe FBI official said, \"I'm not trying to demonize any people,\" but emphasized the reach of the Communist Party and its control of all aspects of Chinese life. Businesses that refuse to meet a party request that might contravene US laws \"risk being shut down,\" Priestap said.\n\nChina views members of its diaspora in the US including students and technology company executives as \"being beholden to them,\" Priestap said. They will \"utilize, lean on those students, say if you want your tuition paid ... then you better not come home empty-handed,\" he added.\n\n\"They think of them as just simply an extension of their power of their nation,\" Priestap said. The awareness level of knowledge Chinese nationals in the US have about the way they're being used by their government varies, he said.\n\n\"Based on FBI interaction with some of those individuals, it really is a case-by-case basis,\" he said. \"Some are not knowledgeable in the least and are completely unwitting of doing anything in furtherance of their government's aims and others ... understand they have obligations to meet.\"\n\nDemers said the US is considering new steps for dealing with non-traditional espionage, both in and outside the US. One possibility, he said, is the creation of a body akin to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. The interagency committee reviews transactions involving foreign investment in the US that involve sensitive technology and can veto sales.\n\n\"We also need to be looking at activity that's perfectly legal, but may pose a national security threat,\" Demers told the committee, saying it may require legislation and should include measures to counter theft of US intellectual property outside the US by non-Americans. That kind of activity is currently outside the scope of current US law, he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "British PM Theresa May survives no-confidence vote", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/tVJiq3bTC68/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) UK Prime Minister Theresa May survived a vote of no-confidence triggered by members of her own party over her handling of Britain's departure from the European Union, but her margin of victory was significantly narrower than her supporters expected.\n\nMay won by 200 votes to 117, meaning that a third of her parliamentary party failed to back her.

The news illustrates a disturbing trend, civil rights groups say.\n\nOn Friday, December 7, a fire destroyed a Jehovah's Witnesses house of worship. It was the fifth attack this year targeting the religious group in Washington state, federal officials said.\n\nThe next day, a black man was assaulted at a bar in Lynnwood, Washington, by eight self-professed members of a neo-Nazi skinhead group, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Members of the group allegedly yelled racist slurs during the incident, and an employee identified as an Asian man was injured as he tried to intervene.\n\nOn Sunday, Pittsburgh officials said that anti-Semitic pamphlets were being spread throughout the city, including in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the site of a mass shooting that targeted Jews in October. The same day, Nazi-themed posters were found in various locations around the State University of New York's Purchase College. A student was arrested in connection with the posters and charged with a hate crime, the Westchester County District Attorney's Office said.\n\nOn Monday, a 21-year-old man was arrested for allegedly plotting to kill worshipers in a Jewish synagogue in Toledo, officials said.\n\nThe recent headlines reflect a broader trend, according to civil rights groups. There's been a rise in reports of such incidents over the past three years, they say -- a trend that is also borne out by federal data.\n\nEach year, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) releases the Hate Crime Statistics report based on incidents law enforcement agencies submit to the FBI. In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, hate crime reports rose by about 17% from 2016.\n\nAnd that estimate may well be a low estimate. Reporting of hate crimes to the FBI is notoriously low , and an analysis of the 2017 UCR report by the Arab American Institute found that some apparent hate crimes that made headlines were not included in the report.\n\nNumerous factors account for the low rates of reporting, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute. Reporting is voluntary, and different law enforcement agencies follow different state laws or internal policies that dictate reporting of hate crimes.\n\nSteady increases in hate crimes numbers since 2015\n\nIn 2015, reports of anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 67% , according to FBI numbers, from 154 incidents in 2014 to 257 in 2015.\n\nCivil rights groups say it was a turning point, with the following years showing a steady year-to-year increase.\n\nThe next year, 2016, hate crimes reached a historic high. There was a surge in reports around the time of the 2016 presidential election , and reports continued to rise in 2017. Of 7,106 single-bias hate crimes reported in 2017 , 59.6% of victims were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry; 20.6% were targeted because of their religion; and 15.8% were targeted because of their sexual orientation.\n\nOf the 5,060 victims targeted for their race , ethnicity or ancestry, 48.6% were attacked because of the offenders' anti-Black or African-American bias. Of the 1,749 anti-religious hate crimes, 58.1% were the product of anti-Jewish bias.\n\n\"Rising hate crimes continue to be a reality in America,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. \"The rash of incidents we've seen recently are a reminder that we need to be vigilant against hate and anti-Semitism in all forms.\"\n\nWhile hate is not new to America, experts say the divisive political climate and the rise of hate speech, among other factors, are emboldening people to act on hateful impulses.\n\nThe Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 was a byproduct of that emboldened hate, said Nadia Aziz of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nMainstream America was seemingly caught off guard by scenes of torch-wielding white nationalists chanting racist and anti-Semitic slurs. Tensions boiled over as counterprotesters clashed with rally participants, and a Nazi sympathizer killed one person and injured dozens more with his car. But anti-hate groups say white supremacists and far-right extremist groups have been gathering momentum online and in underground movements for years.\n\nThe driver in the Charlottesville incident, James Fields, was convicted in state court of first-degree murder in Heather Heyer's death, and on nine more charges stemming from the incident.\n\nBut the Charlottesville case demonstrates how statistics can be unreliable -- the FBI's 2017 data does not appear to include Fields' case, even though he also faces 30 federal hate crime charges stemming from the incident.\n\nHeyer was killed on August 12, 2017. But Charlottesville police did not report any incidents in the third quarter, the data shows . The agency only reported one incident in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nFBI data paints an incomplete picture\n\nAnother reason why statistics don't tell the full story is because many crime victims don't report to law enforcement, said Logan Casey, policy researcher with Movement Advancement Project, which tracks laws and policies affecting the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Given that only some jurisdictions keep statistics on hate crimes, and that as many as half of crime victims don't report their experiences to authorities, it's difficult to know the true incidence of these crimes,\" he said in an email.\n\nAlthough the LGBT community is not reflected in the series of apparent hate crimes of the past few days, \"one of the trends we're seeing is a rise in hate crimes against LGBT people,\" he said. He pointed to data suggesting that 25 transgender people in have been murdered in the US this year, a record high for another year in a row.\n\n\"The vast majority of these victims are transgender women of color, illustrating the intersections of racist and anti-LGBT violence.\"\n\nCivil rights groups say it remains to be seen if the recent incidents are reported to the FBI or counted in the UCR's report next year.\n\nWhat might be behind the trend\n\nNo single factor explains the apparent increase in hate incidents, experts say.\n\n\"Part of the problem is the increasing mainstream acceptance of hate speech and online hate,\" Greenblatt, of the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\n\"Words have consequences. It's time for all leaders to step forward and clearly denounce hate. After the tragedy the Jewish community witnessed in Pittsburgh, it is not just something that we as Americans are asking of our leaders -- but something we should come to expect.\"\n\nAziz, Berry and Logan attributed the rise of hate crimes to divisive rhetoric from the Trump administration pertaining to marginalized communities, including immigrants and people of color, as well as policies that undermine the rights of those groups.\n\nThe White House has not responded to CNN's request for a response to those allegations.\n\n\"The President of the United States, both from his social media presence and his remarks during formal White House events, is regularly referring to fear as a motive for policy,\" Berry said. \"We're seeing the presidential bully pulpit being used to divide and spread fear, and without question that has consequences in real peoples' lives.\"\n\nThe upshot of the present state of affairs is that more groups are emerging to support victims of hate -- and more people appear to be reporting incidents of bias, Aziz said.\n\nAziz heads up the group's Stop Hate Project , which works to ensure individuals and organizations have resources to combat hate in their communities. Hate crimes require proof of the additional element of bias to the underlying crime, which makes it different from other crimes, especially in states with narrow categories of protected classes, she said.\n\nAcknowledging that many communities may not feel comfortable reporting to law enforcement, Aziz urged victims to go to police whenever possible -- or to find someone to advocate on their behalf. She suggested calling the Lawyers' Committee hotline, or reporting an incident through a community group's website.\n\nIf someone paints swastikas or racist slurs on a home or public property, Aziz advised documenting those examples before covering them up.\n\n\"As we talk hate crimes more and more, I hope people will be more comfortable about talking about them when they're targeted,\" she said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "'I begged them for help': Wells Fargo foreclosure nightmare", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/rP4fhUfTMcY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) Foreclosures can be extremely painful events. Imagine finding out years later that it was all a big mistake.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Jeff and Eva Reiner. The couple turned to Wells Fargo ( WFC ), their mortgage servicer, for help making their payments after Eva, the family's breadwinner, was laid off by Verizon ( VZ ) in 2010.\n\n\"We were desperate. I begged them for help,\" Eva Reiner told CNN Business.\n\nBut Wells Fargo did not accept their requests for a mortgage modification for their beloved 6-acre property in rural South Carolina. Wells Fargo eventually foreclosed on the home, forcing the couple to move their teenage son, give up three dogs and forfeit the equity they had built up in the house.\n\nThis fall, the Reiners learned from media reports they were among the approximately 545 homeowners who lost their homes because of an apparent software glitch with Wells Fargo's loan modification process.\n\nThe Reiner family, whose home was foreclosed on by Wells Fargo after a glitch.\n\nThe latest was last week. A lawsuit was filed against Wells Fargo seeking justice for borrowers like the Reiners who say they were victimized by the bank's wrongful foreclosures.\n\n'I had a breakdown'\n\nIn September 2018, Wells Fargo sent the Reiners a letter explaining that the bank had \"difficult news\" to share: The family's plea for a mortgage modification would have been accepted if not for a \"faulty calculation. Wells Fargo said the couple should have been approved for a trial modification \u2014 a reduction in monthly payments that would have saved their house from foreclosure.\n\n\"I had a breakdown. I could not believe we'd get a letter of that nature so many years later,\" said Eva, who is on her fifth round of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. The couple now lives in an apartment in Virginia.\n\nJeff Reiner, a stay-at-home dad who took care of their special needs son, said the mortgage modification would have allowed the family to remain in their home. \"Without assistance, we just didn't have a chance,\" he said.\n\nIn the letter, Wells Fargo apologized for the mistake, enclosed a check for $15,000 to help \"make things right\" and offered free mediation for further compensation.\n\nThe letter did not explain how Wells Fargo decided on the $15,000 sum, but it did say the couple could cash it and still pursue mediation.\n\n\"We realize our decision impacted you at a time you were facing a hardship,\" a Wells Fargo mortgage executive wrote.\n\nA Wells Fargo spokesman told CNN Business that the bank should have sent the Reiner family a proactive modification offer in 2012, but it didn't because of the calculation error. He said that loans like this one that are backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were eligible for modification even before the borrower requests one.\n\n\"If they had accepted the offer [that Wells Fargo never made] and kept up with the payments, then the foreclosure would have been avoidable potentially,\" the Wells Fargo spokesman said.\n\nHe added that the October 2012 foreclosure occurred after the family filed for bankruptcy and the loan was nearly 17 months past due.\n\n'Don't just blame it on the software'\n\nJeff Reiner said he appreciates that Wells Fargo has admitted its error, but that $15,000 is woefully insufficient given the financial and emotional loss the family suffered.\n\n\"It doesn't even begin to compare to the chain of events that were started by their denial of assistance,\" he said. He compared it to someone saying: \"Sorry about cutting off your arm. Here's a Band-Aid.\"\n\nJeff said he wants Wells Fargo to at least show that it understands the consequences of its mistake. \"And don't just blame it on the software,\" he said. \"Where was the human oversight?\"\n\nThe Reiner family was forced to say goodbye to their six-acre property in South Carolina and move their special needs son after the foreclosure.\n\nJeff and Eva Reiner are now represented by Gibbs Law Group, the Oakland law firm that filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo. The complaint, filed on December 5 in US District Court for the Northern District of California, is seeking class action status.\n\n\"We think Wells Fargo's errors are having devastating and long-lasting effects on people's lives,\" Michael Schrag, a partner at Gibbs Law Group, told CNN Business.\n\nThe Wells Fargo spokesman said the bank was served the lawsuit \"only recently\" and \"can't comment specifically on many of its claims at this time.\"\n\nHe added that while Wells Fargo \"would prefer to work directly with each customer to resolve the matter,\" if they aren't satisfied with the offer or mediation then borrowers are able to pursue other legal options.\n\nHundreds of customers lost their homes\n\nDuring the mortgage crisis, Congress created the Home Affordable Modification Program , which aimed to keep struggling homeowners out of foreclosure. Wells Fargo, one of America's biggest mortgage lenders, was among the many banks that chose to participate in HAMP.\n\nUnder Treasury Department guidelines, mortgage servicers were required to issue modifications to borrowers who had documented financial hardships and an ability to make their monthly mortgage payments after a modification.\n\nLenders were directed to reduce monthly mortgage payments to as close as possible to 31% of the borrower's monthly income by slashing interest rates, extending the length of mortgages or taking other steps.\n\nIn August, Wells Fargo made a shocking admission in an SEC filing: about 400 homeowners were foreclosed upon between April 2010 and October 2015 because of a \"calculation error\" in the bank's mortgage modification underwriting software. That glitch caused customers who were otherwise qualified to get denied for a loan modification.\n\nLast month, Wells Fargo said in a new SEC filing that it identified another 145 customers whose homes were wrongly foreclosed on. The bank said an expanded review found additional \"errors\" that inflated the estimate of attorneys' fees for homeowners in the foreclosure process. Legal fees are taken into account when banks determine if customers qualify for mortgage modification.\n\nAll told, Wells Fargo said in the filing that about 870 customers were incorrectly denied a loan modification or were not offered a loan modification plan in cases where they would have otherwise qualified.\n\nWhy didn't Wells Fargo act earlier?\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of \"concealing\" the glitch. It says that Wells Fargo failed to disclose the problem years ago even though the bank said in SEC filings the calculation error was corrected in October 2015.\n\nThe Wells Fargo spokesman told CNN Business that while the bank initially identified and fixed the calculation error in October 2015, it was only later determined that accounts should be reviewed to determine if the problem led to any \"unintended issues\" for customers. He said those later reviews identified customer impact and \"shortly thereafter\" the bank publicly disclosed the matter.\n\nVictims of Wells Fargo's wrongful foreclosure suffered \"significant stress causing physical injuries and emotional distress,\" the lawsuit alleges. The complaint accuses Wells Fargo of engaging in business practices that are \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous,\" and harmful to consumers.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the lawsuit is Alicia Hernandez, who sought a mortgage modification from Wells Fargo after getting laid off during the Great Recession. Wells Fargo told Hernandez that she didn't qualify for help and eventually foreclosed on her North Bergen, New Jersey, condo in late 2015, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWells Fargo informed Hernandez in a September 2018 letter that it discovered the rejection was because of a \"faulty calculation,\" according to the lawsuit. The bank sent Hernandez a check for $15,000.\n\n\"The check does not make up for the severe financial and other consequences that Wells Fargo's calculation inflicted on Ms. Hernandez,\" the lawsuit said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Remains found in Long Island basement are homeowner's father, police confirm", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/xUMkTXuwcrI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Human remains discovered by a man digging below his basement in October have been identified as his missing father, who disappeared in 1961, according to the Suffolk County Police Department.\n\n\"Now that we know he didn't abandon us it makes us feel better,\" the son, Michael Carroll, 57, said on Wednesday, adding \"it was what I expected.\"\n\nHe said his family is taking it very hard. \"When fiction becomes nonfiction, it changes the way you see the world.\"\n\nPolice released a statement Wednesday confirming that the remains belong to George Carroll, who disappeared when Michael was an infant.

I stand before your Honor humbly and painfully aware that we are here today for one reason: Because of my actions that I pled guilty to on August 21, and as well on November 29. I take full responsibility for each act that I pled guilty to, the personal ones to me and those involving the President of the United States of America. Viktor Frankl in his book, \"Man's Search for Meaning,\" he wrote, \"There are forces beyond your control that can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.\" Your Honor, this may seem hard to believe, but today is one of the most meaningful days of my life.\n\nThe irony is today is the day I am getting my freedom back as you sit at the bench and you contemplate my fate. I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the fateful day that I accepted the offer to work for a famous real estate mogul whose business acumen I truly admired. In fact, I now know that there is little to be admired. I want to be clear. I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today, and it was my own weakness, and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light. It is for these reasons I chose to participate in the elicit act of the President rather than to listen to my own inner voice which should have warned me that the campaign finance violations that I later pled guilty to were insidious.\n\nRecently, the President Tweeted a statement calling me weak, and he was correct, but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds rather than to listen to my own inner voice and my moral compass. My weakness can be characterized as a blind loyalty to Donald Trump, and I was weak for not having the strength to question and to refuse his demands.

In August, he pleaded guilty in a Manhattan US attorney's case to two campaign-finance violations tied to payments he made or orchestrated to women during the campaign -- adult-film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- to stay silent about alleged sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nProsecutors have said that in executing the payments, Cohen \"acted in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump, who has denied having the affairs with the two women. Cohen also pleaded guilty to five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a bank.\n\nIn late November, Cohen was charged in a separate case from the special counsel's office with one count of lying to Congress about how long discussions involving a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow had extended into the 2016 campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, US District Judge William Pauley III sentenced Cohen to 36 months in prison for the case from New York federal prosecutors and two months for the special counsel's matter; the sentences will be served concurrently.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen pled guilty to a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct,\" Pauley told the courtroom. \"Each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition.\"\n\nWhile the judge agreed with the special counsel's office that Cohen should receive some leniency for his efforts to provide information that was valuable to its investigation, Pauley criticized Cohen for his crimes, his lies and his willingness to commit both in his capacity as an attorney.\n\n\"Our democratic institutions depend on the honesty of our citizenry in dealing with the government,\" Pauley said.\n\nPauley also ordered Cohen to pay $1.39 million in restitution, $500,000 in forfeiture and $100,000 in fines. He must report to prison on March 6.\n\nAs he addressed the court, Cohen was visibly emotional, pausing several times to collect himself. His wife, son and daughter, who appeared in court alongside his elderly parents and in-laws, sobbed through much of the remarks. His father, in a wheelchair, observed the events with his hands clasped at his mouth.\n\n'Eroded faith in the electoral process'\n\nThe cases against Cohen have emerged as one of the most significant threats to date for Trump. Both Cohen and prosecutors pinned Cohen's crimes on Trump's orders, and the judge on Wednesday said Cohen's election violations \"implicate a far more insidious harm\" to democracy. Cohen's attorney compared the special counsel probe to the inquiry that ultimately toppled President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn seeking a lighter sentence for his client, Cohen's attorney, Guy Petrillo, said that the special counsel's office \"investigation is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40-plus years ago in the days of Watergate.\"\n\nPetrillo also sought to convey the stakes of Cohen's efforts to aid investigators, saying that when Cohen attempted to help the special counsel, \"he knew the President might shut down the investigation.\"\n\n\"He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country,\" Petrillo said.\n\nBut Assistant US Attorney Nicholas Roos told the courtroom that Cohen's campaign finance crimes carried a \"tremendous societal cost.\"\n\n\"Together, these crimes implicate core defining parts of our democracy: Government funded by the people, free and transparent elections,\" Roos said. \"And in committing these crimes, Mr. Cohen has eroded faith in the electoral process and compromised the rule of law.\"\n\nNational Enquirer parent makes deal\n\nWednesday's events also introduced even further potential peril for the President.\n\nMoments after Cohen's sentencing, the Manhattan US Attorney's office revealed that in September it had reached an agreement with American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, in which it will not prosecute the company in exchange for its admission that it participated in the $150,000 payment Cohen arranged to silence McDougal \"in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign.\"\n\nProsecutors noted that the agreement also requires the company -- whose chairman and CEO, longtime Trump ally David Pecker, received immunity from prosecutors in their investigation of Cohen -- to \"provide cooperation in the future.\"\n\nCooperation with Mueller\n\nThough the Manhattan US Attorney's office had described Cohen in court filings as minimally helpful to its investigations, the special counsel's office again stressed to the court on Wednesday that Cohen had provided \"helpful\" and \"valuable\" information to its investigation.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen has sought to tell us the truth,\" special counsel prosecutor Jeannie Rhee told the judge, after acknowledging that Cohen initially lied to her office. \"He has provided our office with credible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation and within the purview of the special counsel's office.\"\n\nThe special counsel said in a filing last week that Cohen had told investigators about a set of efforts to communicate between Trump, his associates and the Russian government during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFor his part, Cohen vowed on Wednesday that he could continue to try to assist investigators, and Cohen adviser Lanny Davis said in a statement after the sentencing that \"after Mr. Mueller completes his investigation and issues his final report, I look forward to assisting Michael to state publicly all he knows about Mr. Trump.\"\n\nIn court, Cohen vowed that what he described as his efforts to cooperate against the President wouldn't be in vain. \"Despite being vilified by the press and inundated with character assassinations over the past almost two years, I still stand today, and I am committed to proving my integrity and ensuring that history will not remember me as the villain of his story.\"\n\nSeveral senior Trump officials have pleaded guilty in the special counsel's investigation, including Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, but none were as close to the President for as long as Cohen."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The 4 people sentenced to prison so far in Mueller's investigation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/26KOQYIY7qQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Four people have been sentenced to prison as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, with the latest being former Donald Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen. Here's a roundup of the four people, their crimes and their punishments.\n\nMichael Cohen\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to evading taxes from his personal business ventures, violating campaign finance laws at the direction of candidate Trump and lying to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Russia during the campaign. Most of the charges were brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after a referral from Mueller.\n\nAfter asking for a punishment without incarceration, Cohen was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in prison. The judge ordered Cohen to begin his prison term in March 2019.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos\n\nTrump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government. One of his Kremlin-linked contacts told him early in 2016 that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" according to court filings.\n\nA federal judge sentenced Papadopoulos to serve 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI. Papadopoulos cooperated with the investigation and asked the judge for leniency, while prosecutors sought a six-month prison term. He served his punishment at a federal prison in Wisconsin and was released from prison earlier this month.\n\nAlex van der Zwaan\n\nDutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his discussions with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates. Van der Zwaan was previously employed by the international law firm Skadden Arps, which worked on Ukraine projects with Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nHe sentenced by a federal judge to 30 days in prison and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine. He served his time at a federal facility in Pennsylvania and was released in June. He was quickly deported back home to his native Netherlands as a consequence of his felony conviction.\n\nRichard Pinedo\n\nRichard Pinedo of California pleaded guilty to identity fraud connected to Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to court filings. Pinedo acknowledged that he sold dummy bank accounts to Russians who used them for online payment services, like PayPal. Pinedo's lawyer said his client was unaware of the identity or motivation of his customers."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Pelosi announces deal to win votes of Democratic critics", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Ooi_PZsTVl8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced a deal Wednesday that could likely deliver her the votes to become speaker again -- but only for another two terms, laying out a timeline she had been reluctant to articulate until now.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader negotiated an agreement with a small group of Democrats who've been lobbying to block Pelosi from the speakership in their push for a new generation of leadership.\n\nThe deal -- which won over seven of her critics -- would essentially guarantee Pelosi two more years as speaker but she could serve no longer than four years in the job.\n\n\"Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Pelosi is backing a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders. The agreement that would affect Pelosi, as well as her top two deputies, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina -- a trio that's led House Democrats for more than a decade.\n\nThe agreement stipulates that top leaders can serve for only three terms. Another term sought beyond that would require approval by two-thirds of the Democratic caucus, higher than the current simple majority threshold.\n\nThe proposal is retroactive, meaning Pelosi would be entering her third term in 2019. If she did go on to win a fourth term in 2021 with the support of two-thirds of the caucus, it would have to be her last. Pelosi, along with Hoyer and Clyburn, served for two terms in leadership when Democrats controlled the House from from 2007-2011.\n\nPelosi announced the incoming Democratic caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries and the incoming House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern plan to bring it up for a vote in caucus on February 15.\n\nIf the caucus votes against the term limits proposal, Pelosi said she'll still stick by it.\n\n\"I am comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not,\" she said.\n\nWhile the talks at one point also included term limits for lower-level leadership roles and committee chairs, the agreement announced Wednesday only addressed top leadership positions.\n\nPelosi, as she seeks to shore up support for her speaker bid, has been in active conversations with Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, who helped manage a letter signed by more than a dozen Democrats vowing to not support Pelosi for speaker.\n\nMoments after the deal was announced, Perlmutter, along with Reps. Bill Foster, Linda Sanchez, Seth Moulton, Tim Ryan, Filemon Vela, and Rep.-elect Gil Cisernos announced they would support her.\n\n\"We wish to thank Nancy Pelosi for her willingness to work with us to reach this agreement. We are proud that our agreement will make lasting institutional change that will strengthen our caucus and will help develop the next generation of Democratic leaders. We will support and vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House in the 116th Congress.\"\n\nThe speaker vote is set for January 3. While Pelosi won the nomination for speaker last month with than 85% of the caucus behind her, she needs slightly more than that in the full House vote on January 3.\n\nAt that time, she would need a majority of the full House, which traditionally amounts to 218 votes. With 235 Democrats in the House, she can afford to lose 17 of her own and still get to 218. It's expected many of those anti-Pelosi votes will come from freshmen who pledged to oppose her during their campaigns.\n\nIt's still unclear whether the term limits will be officially adopted, as the caucus still has to approve a rule change and many Democrats have already expressed staunch opposition to the idea. On Tuesday, House Democrats held a heated debate over term limits, ultimately deciding to table the discussion until incoming freshmen members can take part in the conversation at the start of the new year.\n\nBroadly, the idea of term limits is a contentious topic among Democrats, where a divide exists between those eager to see a new generation of leaders and those who say seniority and experience matter.\n\nHoyer, who's been in Congress for three decades and served as majority leader when Democrats last held power, passionately decried the idea of term limits this week. Hoyer noted he had repeatedly cosponsored legislation in the past that called for repealing term limits for the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not for term limits. ... Is anybody confused?\" he told reporters on Tuesday, before reiterating it emphatically. \"I. Am. Not. For. Term. Limits.\"\n\nAsked how he feels about Pelosi entertaining the idea of term limits in her negotiations, Hoyer was frank. \"She's not negotiating for me.\"\n\nRep. Cedric Richmond, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, also said he opposed the idea, saying if people don't like a leader, they can just vote them out at the end of a term.\n\n\"This whole thing about these guys needing something so that they can land this damn plane is getting silly,\" Richmond said, referring to the group of rebels. \"Land the plane.

Hoffer answered, and he heard: \"This is the State Department. We have a problem.\"\n\nHoffer was told that an individual in Havana was hearing odd noises, experiencing pain and ringing in the ear, and feeling dizzy and confused.\n\nThat person, and others with similar symptoms, were United States diplomatic personnel living in Cuba -- and the cause of their symptoms remains a medical mystery.\n\nIn August 2017, State Department officials said the cause may have been a possible \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices. Cuba officials have arduously denied such an attack.\n\nHoffer, a professor of otolaryngology and neurological surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida, examined some of those personnel along with his colleagues.\n\nNow Hoffer and his colleagues -- from the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh -- are revealing new details on those symptoms seen among the 25 diplomats in a study, published in the journal Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology on Wednesday.\n\nIn this retrospective study, the researchers described their findings as \"the first report of the acute symptoms in this patient group.\"\n\nA separate study, previously published in the medical journal JAMA in March, described the symptoms of 21 personnel who sought medical attention and found that a majority of them reported problems with memory, concentration, balance, eyesight, hearing, sleeping or headaches that lasted more than three months. Three people eventually needed hearing aids for moderate to severe hearing loss, and others had ringing or pressure in their ears according to that report.\n\nBeginning in 2016 and throughout last year, several diplomats and their family members stationed in Havana reported hearing bizarre noises and experiencing a range of symptoms, such as dizziness, ear pain, and ringing in the ears.\n\nWhen it comes to exactly what they were suffering from, \"what caused it, who did it, why it was done, we don't know any of those things,\" Hoffer said during a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe US State Department and federal investigators have been unable to definitively attribute the source or cause of these symptoms, but in August last year, several department officials told CNN they might have been the result of an \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices.\n\nCuban officials have strenuously denied that there were any targeted attacks on diplomats in Havana and said their symptoms could have been caused by other factors.\n\n\"All has been speculation or manipulated information,\" Cuba's Director General for US Affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Wednesday about the US investigation into the health incidents.\n\n\"The concrete questions have not been asked. Why has the US government not been ready to cooperate with Cuba? What is the US government hiding? Why is it not capable of putting forward concrete, real information that the scientific community can accept?\"\n\nThe study released Wednesday details symptoms experienced by 15 men and 10 women.\n\nThey all reported being exposed to either some strange noise or pressure and then immediately after that exposure, the majority felt intense ear pain and ringing, according to the study. They all then noticed cognitive symptoms, including feeling disoriented.\n\nThe study noted that some of the findings may seem similar to symptoms of a \"mild traumatic brain injury following blast exposure or blunt trauma.\"\n\n\"It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing an inner ear disturbance or demonstrate findings suggestive of an mTBI,\" or mild traumatic brain injury, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nYet the injury pattern seen among these patients had some differences from the typical symptoms seen with a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury, the researchers noted.\n\n\"In addition, the low incidence of headaches (around 25%) is unusual, as many studies of mTBI show that headache is one of the most common and persistent symptoms,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nSince the exposure responsible for the study's findings remains unknown, the researchers wrote, they could not \"exclude any potential directed or non\u2010directed energy sources at this time.\"\n\nDirected energy sources would be some form of energy pointed or focused directly on an object or a person, Carey Balaban, a professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Pittsburgh and one of the authors of the study, said in the news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"The energy may be acoustic, pressure waves, you've probably heard of LRAD devices (or long-range acoustic devices) -- devices they've discussed in the press -- so ultrasound is one mode that could be used for this. We also could have radiofrequency. We could have microwave. We could have light -- lasers are an example of it.

Some countries have used a \"mosquito\" -- which produces a very high-pitched sound that can be perceived by teenagers but not adults -- to prevent teens from loitering.\n\n\"I know of no acoustic effect that would produce concussion-like symptoms; according to my research, strong effects on humans require loudness levels that would be perceived as very loud noise while exposed,\" J\u00fcrgen Altmann, a physics professor at Technischen Universit\u00e4t Dortmund in Berlin, told CNN in May\n\nLimitations of the new study include that a small number of patients with symptoms were evaluated and uncertainty remains around the true cause of the symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"The way we view this is that it's an area for active research,\" Balaban said.\n\n\"I'm currently doing some research sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, where we're looking at using computer simulation and a variety of physical and biological models to just get an idea of what are likely possibilities,\" he said. \"We're not ready to rule anything out yet but we're ready to find evidence so that we can rule things out.

He anticipates that it will continue to rise, partially because of climate change.\n\nThe most common cause of injury is bites from non-venomous arthropods, the group that includes spiders, mosquitoes, ticks and centipedes. As temperatures rise, the habitats of some of these creatures will get larger as they will be able to survive in more places, meaning they are able to injure more people.\n\nThe habitats of larger animals, such as bears, are overlapping more and more with human developments and recreational activities, as well, so injuries from these animals could also increase, the study says.\n\n\"We looked at approximately 20% of the emergency departments in the United States over a span of five years, so 2010 to 2014, and we looked at all the patients who came in who had diagnosis codes that corresponded to animal injury,\" said Dr. Joseph Forrester , one of the authors of the study published Tuesday in the BMJ.\n\nOver the five-year period, over 6 million emergency department admissions were linked to animal-related injuries. That works out to 1,291,507 people annually, or 19 injuries per 10,000 visits.\n\nThe data came from the Nationwide Emergency Department Survey by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Forrester and his co-authors used the World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases to identify those who visited the emergency department with animal-related injuries.\n\n\"First and foremost, the most common injury associated with an animal is not actually a bear or alligator, bottom line, it's actually things much smaller,\" said Forrester, a trauma surgery and critical care fellow at Stanford University.\n\nNearly half of the injuries, 41%, were related to bites from non-venomous arthropods. Dog bites were the next highest cause, accounting for 26% of the injuries. Third were bites and stings from hornets, wasps and bees, which made up 13% of the injuries.\n\nThe largest percentage of ER visits for animal-related injuries -- 42% -- was in the South.\n\nAnother important point noted in the study \"is that those people with the lowest incomes, and likely poor housing, are most impacted by the types of injuries that cause the most severe outcomes,\" Lorann Stallones , director of the graduate degree program in public health at the Colorado School of Public Health at Colorado State University, wrote in an email.\n\nThe study found that the highest group of patients, 34%, were in the lowest 25% household income for their ZIP code. These were also the patients most likely to be injured by bites from venomous snakes, spiders and arthropods.\n\n\"This finding has implications for public health prevention programs targeting injury reduction from preventable causes,\" said Stallones, who was not involved in the research.\n\nOnly 3% of those who were seen in an emergency department were admitted to the hospital. One-third of hospital admissions came from non-venomous arthropod bites. Those who had isolated abdominal injuries were most likely to be admitted to the hospital or die.\n\nAlthough there were a multitude of injuries in the study period, there were only 1,162 deaths, accounting for 0.02% of the emergency visits. Of those deaths, 278 came after a bite from a non-venomous arthropod, the largest number from a single cause.\n\nRat bites were the mechanism of injury with the highest frequency of deaths: 6.5 deaths per 10,000 bites. Bites from venomous snakes and lizards followed closely. Dog bites were responsible for the third highest rate of deaths.\n\nOne possible explanation for the higher frequency of deaths after rat bites could be diseases associated with them, according to Dr. Christopher Holstege , a professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Some of these diseases and infections include staphylococcus, rat bite fever and cellulitis.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that \"in addition to causing pain, injury, or nerve damage, dog bites can become infected, putting the bite victim at risk for illness or in rare cases death.\"\n\nHolstege pointed out that due to the codes used to identify animal injuries, \"it's hard for them to delve further into exactly why certain animals were related to mortality or related to admissions.\"\n\n\"I think what this article really does is give us a better snapshot in the modern era of the cost associated, and when you start looking at the cost and start trying to decrease health care costs, it's good to get data like this out so that we can also look at prevention efforts,\" said Holstege, who was not involved with the research.\n\nDog bites and non-venomous arthropods were the two most costly types of injuries, costing $1.36 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, over the five years analyzed. These categories, along with injuries from venomous snakes and lizards, which cost $898 million, accounted for approximately 60% of all the costs.\n\nHolstege suggests that the costs associated with venomous snake and lizard injuries could be due to the antidotes required.\n\nLooking at other methods of care is another way the costs could be decreased, according to Holstege.\n\n\"Very few of these cases were admitted to the hospital,\" he said. \"The question is, how many actually needed to go to an emergency department, and could costs have been decreased by either calling the poison center if it's envenomation with something that's poisonous, or talking to a primary care doctor?\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe authors note that the total cost of these injuries over the five-year period is $5.96 billion.

The group facing repressive policing was also more likely to have poorer mental health, reports the study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine.\n\nLucy Platt, the lead researcher and an associate professor in public health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that \"repressive police practices increase harms\" for sex workers. The paper also states that policy reform is needed to improve sex workers' safety.\n\nPeter Greenhouse, spokesman and sexual health consultant for the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, agreed. \"This new comprehensive research definitively proves what we've known for many years,\" Greenhouse, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. \"That repressive policing against sex workers increases violence against women and reduces access to sexual health care.\"\n\nSex workers, on average, are 13 times more at risk of HIV than the general population, according to the UK-based charity Avert , which provides HIV education. This is because they are economically vulnerable, are unable to negotiate condom use every time, and experience violence, criminalization and marginalization, Avert says.\n\nThe study looked at peer-reviewed research papers between 1990 and 2018 on sex work, legislation, policing and health. Data from 33 countries, including the UK, was used to estimate the average effects of repressive policing, compared with the effects that sex workers experienced in the absence of this.\n\nSex workers who were not exposed to repressive policing were 30% less likely to have condom-less sex than peers in repressive environments. The risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases doubled and the risk of experiencing physical or sexual violence tripled in sex workers in repressive environments.\n\nBritish campaign collective SWARM, which advocates for the rights of sex workers, connected CNN with one of its members, a sex worker who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym Katy Caradonna. \"It is obvious to sex workers that when we have fewer rights at work -- and any criminalization of sex work reduces our rights at work -- we are less able to protect ourselves from violence or to seek redress, and predators know we are easier targets,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nIn its analysis, the study found many forms of police violence and abuses of power, such as arbitrary arrest, extortion, physical and sexual violence and failure to provide access to justice.\n\nFear of or actual arrest led to sex workers rushing negotiations with clients or working in isolated places that increase dangers, the study explained.\n\nReporting crimes is also an issue. \"Police frequently failed to act on sex workers' reports of such crimes, or blamed and arrested sex workers themselves, meaning that offenders could operate with impunity and sex workers were reluctant to report to the police in [the] future,\" Platt said.\n\nThe study also identified that inequalities within the sex worker community were exacerbated by repressive policing, because police often target specific populations or settings, such as sex workers on the street or trans workers. This \"further marginalized these vulnerable groups,\" Platt explained.\n\nSimilarly, police crackdowns on sex work venues restrict access to health services, making it difficult for outreach programs to find sex workers.\n\nPrevious research showed that decriminalization in New Zealand resulted in sex workers being better able to refuse clients and insist on condom use. Another study showed that decriminalization has the potential to reduce discrimination as well as denials of justice, denigration and verbal abuse.\n\nThe researchers hope that there will be changes to sex work laws. In the meantime, they advocate for the need to scale up funding of specialist sex and sex worker-led services to address the diverse health care and welfare needs of people selling sex.\n\nOne of the researchers, Pippa Grenfell, assistant professor of public health sociology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, added that \"changes to sex work laws alone is not enough.\" She explained that there is a need for wider political action to tackle stigma and discrimination of sex workers by also addressing inequalities in other policies, like housing or social welfare.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere are some limitations to the study. Only a small number of papers that focused on decriminalization of sex work and the criminalization of purchase of sex were included. Similarly, few studies included data on trans female and cis-male sex workers.\n\nCatherine Murphy, senior gender adviser at Amnesty International who was not involved in the study, noted in an email that \"Criminalisation harms sex workers and this study shows that we have nearly three decades of research confirming this.\"\n\nDeborah Gold, chief executive of the UK's National AIDS Trust who was not involved in the study, said in an email that the review presents \"compelling evidence that supports the case that sex workers have been making on HIV for a generation: that repressive criminal law on sex work increases HIV risk and a host of other inequalities.

His time on the show has covered the Iraq War, the 2008 financial crisis and the EU referendum.\n\nIt has also seen the fall of John Major, the rise of Tony Blair and the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.\n\nFrom the growth of social media to the spread of populism, the Dimbleby era has seen the character of political debate change as well - something often reflected in the shifting nature of Question Time itself.\n\n\"I think David was one of the first of a generation who did start challenging the politicians and the people who were on [the programme],\" veteran Tory Kenneth Clarke said on a recent 5 Live podcast.\n\n\"He made a great thing about audience reaction and giving them more space.\"\n\nLabour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also shared her experiences of the host, saying a panellist could never be sure about how Dimbleby would react during a debate.\n\n\"You arrive and he comes up and he is all twinkly and you're thinking 'Yeah, yeah, which David have we got tonight?' - because you don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nNo stranger to controversy\n\nUncertainty has long been an appeal of debate, and Dimbleby has spent more than two decades finding order in the show's weekly mix of politicians and celebrities.\n\nThat mix has not been without its controversies. In 2009 the BBC made the choice to invite then-BNP leader Nick Griffin to be a panellist.\n\nIt was the first time the far-right party had been represented on the programme, and the choice led to a national debate on the BBC's interests and obligations.\n\nIt also led to wider questions about how extremist politicians should be treated by the media, foreshadowing more recent arguments around populism, extremism and 'no platforming'.\n\nImage caption Nick Griffin's appearance was watched by more than eight million people\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme at the time, Dimbleby said he had wanted to \"expose\" the BNP leader to an audience.\n\n\"The idea of exposing the BNP or, to put it more objectively or disinterestedly, allowing the BNP to face an audience and face questions from them seemed to me to be the right thing to do - as long as they were a substantial political party or a party big enough to be included.\"\n\nExposure was certainly what Mr Griffin faced. The episode was watched by more than eight million people, the highest audience since Question Time began broadcasting in 1979.\n\nFuelling social media\n\nPolitical controversy might have had its part in fuelling such large viewing figures. But another possible factor is something that has only continued to grow since 2009: social media.\n\nDimbleby's tenure on Question Time has seen the likes of Twitter and Facebook enter the cultural landscape. In an age of hashtags and instantaneous commentary, the programme has thrived.\n\nStatements and questions can be quoted, parodied and turned into memes long before a panellist has stopped speaking. The term \"gammon\" first emerged as a pejorative by online viewers of Question Time in 2016.\n\n(The term refers, as the journalist Adam Bienkov put it, to \"an angry old man with pink cheeks\" and was not directed at Dimbleby himself.)\n\nDimbleby has been lampooned by the Dimblebot Twitter account, which posts 'all-caps' commentary on the debates and pretty much everything else related to the presenter.\n\nAt the same time, social media also means panellists have become susceptible to attacks that extend far beyond the rows of a studio audience.\n\nDuring one episode, Dimbleby told an audience that online comments levelled against Institute of Economic Affairs associate director Kate Andrews ahead of the debate were \"vile, disgusting, loathsome remarks by people hiding under the cloak of anonymity.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dimbleby criticises 'vile' social media attacks on Question Time panellist\n\nA Roman theatre\n\nWhile Question Time's audience may have extended online, the most memorable moments from Dimbleby's time on the show have involved members of the public in the studio.\n\n\"The thing about the audience is that, over time, they've realised that they are just as big as part of the show as anyone else,\" said Ms Thornberry. \"It's like a Roman theatre sometimes.\"\n\nAs presenter, Dimbleby often found himself stealing the limelight. In the midst of the MPs expenses scandal in 2009, Eric Pickles, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, agreed to appear on Question Time.\n\nThings did not go well for him. When asked about how many houses he owned, Mr Pickles admitted to having two - prompting pantomime boos from the audience.\n\nHe then attempted to defend himself, arguing he needed a property close to the House of Commons to make sure he was there on time for meetings.\n\n\"Like a job in other words,\" quipped Dimbleby.\n\nA degree of theatrics might be embraced, but the line is towed at outright heckling.\n\nWhen a particularly rowdy audience member would not stop interrupting businesswoman and activist Gina Miller in 2017, the presenter firmly told him \"he ought to leave\". The man did.\n\nIt was the Question Time equivalent of a pub brawl.\n\nAt turns sharp and sympathetic, Dimbleby's approach has been at the heart of Question Time for a generation. \"He made this programme the David Dimbleby show,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\nThe programme will soon be headed up by Fiona Bruce, who said she was \"thrilled and not a little daunted\" to be taking over from \"one of her television heroes.\"\n\nHow will the flagship politics programme change under its new leader? The ongoing drama around Brexit means Ms Bruce will hit the ground running, but the show has deeper concerns to contend with.\n\nThe whole concept of public debate is different now to 25 years ago. The meme-generating, Roman theatre format might have proven successful in the past, but how will it fare over the next quarter of a century? And what shape will it take in an age of viral panics and anti-expert sentiments?\n\nPerhaps it just needs to keep people watching.\n\n\"At a time when ratings for many scheduled TV programmes are under strain, just maintaining the show's current audience and editorial integrity, while reflecting a changing country and occasionally creating real news, may well count as success,\" commented BBC media editor Amol Rajan.\n\nAs for Dimbleby himself, he has said he is \"not giving up broadcasting\" and that he intends to return to his \"first love: reporting.\"\n\nWe have not seen the last of the man with the scorpion tattoo.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It does not, in our view, stand up to the same level as the others.\"\n\nOther senior figures at these talks have defended the IPCC and said that by the end of the discussions here, the key role of the research needs to be recognised.\n\n\"Let me make this perfectly clear,\" said Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's conference of the parties.\n\n\"Fiji welcomes the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees. We must all accept the science, which is irrefutable. We accept science in virtually every single other form of human endeavour.

It is a successor and upgrade to the IceSat-1 mission that flew from 2003 to 2009.\n\nThe old spacecraft helped pioneer the assessment of sea-ice volume in the Arctic. This is a measurement that involves sensing the difference in height between the top of the floating floes and the surface of the ocean.\n\nThe offset - known as the freeboard - allows researchers to calculate that part of the ice submerged below water. But it requires the satellite to find the cracks in floes where the measurement can be made - and this has just become a whole lot easier thanks to the new laser's horizontal footprint of about 25-30m.\n\n\"Eighty percent of the cracks are less than 50m across, so the resolution of IceSat is very important,\" said Ron Kwok from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\nHeights are calculated from just 150 photons, or particles, of reflected light, but even from just this small number, IceSat-2 is able to produce an elevation number to an accuracy of a little over 2cm.

For the Beijing-born, US-raised writer, the story of the daughter of a Chinese-American immigrant going to Singapore to meet her fiancee's traditional Asian family hit close to home.\n\n\"The thing that moved me most wasn't the love story,\" says Huang, 31. \"The real fairy tale is for someone from the traditional culture to really understand an immigrant.\"\n\nA Shanghai resident, Huang was eager to see how the film - based on the first book of a three-part series by Singaporean-US author Kevin Kwan - would be received on the mainland. It presented, she said, an opportunity for Chinese audiences to learn about and feel a connection to the wider Asian diaspora, and \"feel part of this family\".\n\nThe first Hollywood movie to feature an all-Asian cast for 25 years, the last being Joy Luck Club in 1993, Crazy Rich Asians was a global box-office smash, generating more than $230m worldwide. It has been hailed as a major step forward for Asian representation in Hollywood, with 2019 Golden Globe nominations for Best Movie and Constance Wu rounding out the trilogy's rapturous launch this year.\n\nBut in China, where the film opened on November 30 under the title An Unexpected Tale of Picking Gold, the response was starkly different.\n\nSince its release, Crazy Rich Asians has only grossed $1.5m in China, an \"atrocious\" performance, according to independent China film industry consultant Jonathan Papish.\n\n\"It ranks in the bottom half of all films released in the country this year,\" Papish told Al Jazeera, pointing out that the film earned even less than Show Dogs, a US family comedy given a paltry 3.6/10 rating on film-ranking website IMDB, which made $2.2m.\n\nAnd while internationally buzz has already been building over Crazy Rich Asians' sequel - China Rich Girlfriend, which producers say will be filmed partly in Shanghai over the coming year - the abysmal performance of the first film at the China box office suggests dubious prospects for the series in the world's fastest-growing film market.\n\n\"My advice is just to make the movie for its core market,\" Papish said, referring to the sequel.\n\nOnline criticism\n\nZhao Yi, manager of Shanghai's Premiere Cinema, said she was shocked by how few tickets Crazy Rich Asians sold. \"It's doing far worse than I expected. I saw the film in advance and thought its box office would be at least 200 million yuan ($29m).\"\n\nWhile most cinemas in the city have discontinued or drastically reduced screenings, Zhao says she's been able to maintain viewings at her theatre only because \"it's popular with foreigners\".\n\n180829064300724\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese cinema lovers have sharply criticised the film online. According to popular reviews posted on Chinese movie websites mtime and douban, Crazy Rich Asians wasn't a celebration of Asian culture - it was a demonisation of it.\n\nMany review writers took issue with the film's extreme materialism and promiscuity. \"It shows the dregs of oriental culture,\" wrote one. \"A film that openly exposes the 'ugliness' of the Chinese is being brought into our cinemas.\"\n\nWhile director John Chu said the film aimed to quash stereotypes of Asians, one reviewer said it propagated them, saying \"all the female elders in the film are given the most stereotypical and cliche image: serious, reserved and maintaining strict control\".\n\nOthers said Crazy Rich Asians presented traditional forces, embodied by the character Eleanor (played by Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh) as villainous and backward. \"The confrontation between Rachel and Eleanor - two women representing completely different countries and ideas about family, marriage and being female - ends with Rachel's victory. It almost implies the destiny of contemporary China: thanks to the wind from the West, the old and unprogressive East is given a new life.\"\n\nFor Huang, the overwhelmingly negative reviews felt like \"a gut punch\". She says Chinese audiences simply failed to relate to the film's main character and even felt rejected by her.\n\n\"Rachel is essentially seen [as] a race traitor. She turns up and doesn't speak Chinese, doesn't understand the customs etc Because of her appearance, she's still considered a Chinese person but one who turned her back on her culture,\" says Huang.\n\n'Panda Express of Chinese culture'\n\nBeijing-based filmmaker Stanley Tsang says scenes where lead male Nick Young, played by English-Malaysian actor Henry Golding, speaks Mandarin with a foreign accent, might have also been off-putting.\n\nHe says the same happened Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a Mandarin-language King-fu epic directed by Taiwanese director Ang Lee which was a major global hit but suffered a similar fate at the box office when it was released on the mainland in 2000.\n\n\"Cantonese was the actors' first language, not Mandarin,\" says Tsang, referring to leads Michelle Yeoh - who also starred in Crazy Rich Asians - and Chow Yun-Fat, adding that the different accent \"might have perplexed the audience at the time\".\n\nUltimately, the filmmaker says the film portrayal's of the Asian culture might lead to its flatlining in China.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians is the 'Panda Express' of Chinese culture,\" says Tsang, referring to the popular US-based food-chain which serves Westernised Chinese dishes. \"I studied in Canada and relate to the overseas Chinese people, so I enjoyed the movie. But the mainland market has a different palate.\"\n\nPapish agrees. \"Mainland audiences prefer their 'Chinese' stories to come from China and their Hollywood stories to come from Hollywood; they walk away when the lines are blurred,\" he said.\n\nIt's a point Huang understands. She says Hollywood's appeal on the mainland is based on presenting an \"exotic white experience\".\n\n\"When they see this movie filled with Asian faces, that's not really what they're used to or want. When they see Chinese faces what they expect is a Chinese story with Chinese sensibilities,\" she says.\n\nBut according to Hu Shan, a Beijing-based creative producer and self-described movie buff, the reason for the film's lacklustre Chinese performance is much more simple: its key selling point - an all-Asian cast - was irrelevant for the world's biggest Asian country. Instead, mainland movie-goers opted to spend money on films like Venom, a Marvel action movie released in early November which has so far grossed more than $240m in China alone.\n\n\"The novelty of Crazy Rich Asians only works for Western people who don't know much about Asian culture and are fascinated by how 'crazy rich' Asians can be \u2026 and the Asian diaspora, who are mostly happy just to see their own culture presented in a Hollywood movie,\" says Hu.\n\n\"For the Chinese, both of these points aren't relevant. The love story itself isn't even touching because it's too distant from their own lives.\"\n\nMarketing complaints\n\nThe film's late release date in China didn't help either. Crazy Rich Asians hit mainland screens almost three months after debuting in the United States, giving any keen Chinese viewers plenty of time to source and watch bootleg versions online.\n\nHu says most of her friends hadn't even heard of the movie. Herself, she only watched it because it was available on-board a recent long-haul flight.\n\nBut for Huang, a die-hard fan of what she described as the movie's unique exploration of the \"misunderstandings and the misgivings between Asian diaspora and the motherland\", the lack of substantial marketing in China was \"lazy and ironic\".\n\n\"They should have known that there's a big gap. You need to reach out and make an effort to establish an understanding between people in China and abroad. The movie is a great metaphor for how to attempt to do this, but that wasn't reflected in the marketing. They just took the American trailer and gave it Chinese subtitles.\"\n\nShe still holds out hope for a better result for the sequel but says one thing at least needs to change.\n\n\"If they don't want it to be a fail from the beginning, their marketing needs to start yesterday.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Michael Spavor: China investigates second Canadian", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/michael-spavor-china-investigates-canadian-181213051229927.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "A second Canadian who has gone missing in China is reportedly under investigation on suspicion of \"engaging in activities that harm China's national security\".\n\nBusinessman Michael Spavor was \"being investigated\" by the Dandong city branch of China's Ministry of State Security and the probe started on December 10, a government news agency reported on Thursday.\n\nMichael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, was also detained by Chinese state security on Monday in Beijing, according to his employer, the International Crisis Group think-tank.\n\nKovrig, too, is suspected of \"engaging in activities\" that endanger China's national security, according to a report Wednesday by Beijing News, a local newspaper.\n\n\n\nThe reported investigations of two Canadian nationals come more than a week after Ottawa infuriated Beijing by arresting Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, at Washington's request.\n\n\n\nMeng was released on $7.5m bail by a court in Vancouver on Tuesday.\n\nThe Canadian government had said it saw no explicit link to the Huawei case.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Wednesday that a second Canadian citizen could be in trouble in China.\n\nCanada's foreign ministry said it has been unable to contact Spavor since he notified the government that he was being questioned by Chinese authorities.\n\n\n\nForeign ministry spokesman Guillaume Berube said in a statement issued in Canada late on Wednesday that Spavor is a businessman based in the northern Chinese city of Dandong and runs cultural exchanges with North Korea.\n\n\n\nCanada was working hard to ascertain Spavor's whereabouts and would continue to raise the issue with the Chinese government, Berube said.\n\nSpavor, who is based in Dandong, a China and UK-based non-profit social enterprise.\n\nThe group says on its website it is \"dedicated to facilitating sustainable cooperation, cross-cultural exchanges, activities, trade, and investment\" with North Korea.\n\nIt also says the organisation maintains an \"array of contacts\" within North Korea and is \"nonpolitical\".\n\nSpavor has acted as a translator and facilitator for former US National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman on trips to North Korea and shared Long Island Iced Teas with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on board one of his private boats after they went jet-skiing in 2013.\n\nMore recently, he has been trying to facilitate investment in North Korea in anticipation of sanctions being lifted, often hosting both North Korean officials and potential investors at his office in Dandong, as well as on trips inside North Korea, Spavor has told the Reuters news agency in previous interviews.\n\nChina's foreign ministry suggested on Wednesday that Kovrig might have broken China's laws on the management of non-governmental organisations if he was conducting work in China for the ICG, which is not registered.\n\nAccusations of harming state security could cover a wide range of suspected crimes, and in China, are often very vague when first levelled.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had earlier commented about Kovrig's case and said Ottawa was engaging with Chinese officials, which in the short term looks to have hurt his government's bid to forge closer trade ties with China."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "UN Pushes for Peace in Yemen", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/un-pushes-for-peace-in-yemen/4698645.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "The U.N. secretary-general will be in Sweden Thursday to attend the final day of the first round of intra-Yemeni peace talks.

A vote is planned for 1:45 p.m. EST (1845 UTC).\n\nA handful of Republican senators are expected to join Democrats in ultimately passing the resolution.\n\nThe Republican-led chamber voted 60-39 Wednesday to begin debate on the measure, acting in defiance of the Trump administration, which had strenuously argued against a rupture of cooperation between Washington and longtime ally Riyadh.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an end to U.S. complicity in the ongoing bombing of civilians and the killing of children (in Yemen), in effect, war crimes,\u201d Connecticut Democratic Sen.

The U.S. legislature has not authorized America\u2019s support role in Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign to combat Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels, a conflict that has led to widespread civilian deaths and stands as one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian catastrophes.\n\nBut some argued that, in this instance, the case for asserting war powers authority is weak.\n\n\u201cThe United States is not involved in combat (in Yemen).

Anger spiked after dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Turkey two months ago.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noted that the Trump administration has sanctioned \u201ca large number of persons who were responsible for the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d adding, \u201c(W)e will continue to investigate and take the facts where they lead and get to a place where we hold those responsible accountable.\u201d\n\nBut Pompeo stressed that \u201cAmerica\u2019s interests in the region are important, and our partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important one. It has delivered American security in important ways in President Trump\u2019s first two years in office, and we intend to continue to work with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to keep America safe.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s death remains an open question, and he noted Riyadh\u2019s repeated denials that the kingdom\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, played a role.\n\nThe Senate took up the Yemen resolution hours after CIA Director Gina Haspel briefed leaders of the House of Representatives on the agency\u2019s conclusions about the Khashoggi killing. Haspel similarly briefed key senators last week, after which lawmakers of both parties said they were convinced MSB ordered the journalist\u2019s grisly demise.\n\nWhile the Senate resolution, if approved, would send a strong signal of displeasure to Saudi Arabia, it is likely to stand as a largely symbolic gesture for now. Swift House action became less likely after the chamber advanced a rule blocking a vote on any war powers resolution relating to Yemen for the remainder of the current Congress.\n\nSenators of both parties have said they expect further consideration of Saudi Arabia-related measures when the new Congress is sworn in at the beginning of next year."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Pelosi, Foes Clinch Deal All But Paving Her Way to Speaker", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pelosi-foes-clinch-deal-all-but-paving-her-way-to-speaker/4698668.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Rep. Nancy Pelosi all but ensured Wednesday that she will become House speaker next month, quelling a revolt by disgruntled younger Democrats by agreeing to limit her tenure to no more than four additional years in the chamber's top post.\n\nWithin moments of announcing she would restrict her time in the job, seven of her critics distributed a statement promising to back the California Democrat.\n\nDemocrats widely agreed that the pledge meant Pelosi had clinched a comeback to the post she held from 2007 until January 2011, the last time her party ran the House and the first time the speaker was a woman.\n\nWednesday's accord gives Pelosi a clear path to becoming the most powerful Democrat in government and a leading role in confronting President Donald Trump during the upcoming 2020 presidential and congressional campaigns. It moves a 78-year-old white woman to the cusp of steering next year's diverse crop of House Democrats, with its large number of female, minority and younger members.\n\nThe agreement also ends what's been a distracting, harsh leadership fight among Democrats that has been waged since Election Day, when they gained at least 39 seats and grabbed House control for the next Congress. It was their biggest gain of House seats since the 1974 post-Watergate election.\n\nDemocrats have been hoping to train public attention on their 2019 agenda focusing on health care, jobs and wages, and building infrastructure projects. They also envision investigations of Trump, his 2016 presidential campaign and his administration.\n\nTo line up support, Pelosi initially resorted to full-court lobbying by congressional allies, outside Democratic luminaries, and liberal and labor organizations. She cut deals with individual lawmakers for committee assignments and roles leading legislative efforts.\n\nBut in the end, she had to make concessions about her tenure to make sure she'll win a majority \u2014 likely 218 votes \u2014 when the new House convenes Jan. 3. Democrats are likely to have 235 seats, meaning she could spare only 17 defections and still prevail if, as expected, Republicans all oppose her.\n\nPelosi OK with decision\n\nPelosi had described herself as a transitional leader over the last several weeks. But she'd resisted defining how long she would serve as speaker, saying it would lessen her negotiating leverage to declare herself a lame duck.\n\nOn Wednesday, she gave in to her opponents' demands that she limit her service. Under the deal, House Democrats will vote by Feb. 15 to change party rules to limit their top three leaders to no more than four two-year terms, including time they've already spent in those jobs.\n\n\u201cI am comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not,\u201d Pelosi said in her statement.\n\nTime for younger leaders\n\nPelosi's opponents have argued it was time for younger leaders to command the party. They also said her demonization as an out-of-touch radical in tens of millions of dollars' worth of Republican television ads was costing Democrats seats.\n\nWhile some Democrats are still certain to vote against Pelosi \u2014 especially incoming freshmen who promised to do so during their campaigns \u2014 most Democrats have remained solidly behind her. She's been a strong fundraiser and unrelenting liberal who doesn't shy from political combat, and her backers complained that her opponents were mostly white men who were largely more moderate than most House Democrats.\n\nPressure to back Pelosi seemed to grow after she calmly went toe-to-toe with Trump at a nationally televised verbal brawl in the Oval Office on Tuesday over his demands for congressional approval of $5 billion for his proposed border wall with Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that our agreement will make lasting institutional change that will strengthen our caucus and will help develop the next generation of Democratic leaders,\u201d the rebellious lawmakers said in a written statement.\n\nTo be nominated to a fourth term under the agreement, Pelosi would need to garner a two-thirds majority of House Democrats. Several aides said they believed restlessness by younger members to move up in leadership would make that difficult for her to achieve.\n\nLimits apply to top lieutenants\n\nThe limits would also apply to Pelosi's top lieutenants, No. 2 leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and No. 3 leader James Clyburn of South Carolina. Both are also in their late 70s.\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., was among 16 Democrats who had signed a letter demanding new leadership but who ultimately helped negotiate the deal with Pelosi.\n\nJoining Perlmutter in saying they would now back her were Democratic Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; Tim Ryan of Ohio; Bill Foster of Illinois; Linda Sanchez and Rep.-elect Gil Cisernos, both of California; and Filemon Vela of Texas."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "McCaskill Says She Won't Run Again but Will Stay Active", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/mccaskill-says-she-won-t-run-again-but-will-stay-active/4697840.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Missouri Sen.

Instead, she said she's planning a yet-to-be-announced initiative and that she sees potential in the non-elected public role that former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, a Republican, has taken since he left office 24 years ago.\n\n\"I am not going to disappear,\" McCaskill said. \"I am going to help and I think I can help in terms of the party recruiting good candidates, being prepared. I envision trying to help teach candidates some of the basics.\"\n\nOne thing she won't miss?\n\n\"I will never make another phone call asking for money,\" said McCaskill, who raised nearly $40 million for her re-election bid, almost four times more than Hawley. \"It's terrible, terrible. It is a horrible part of the job and I have done it for a long time.\"\n\nMcCaskill, 65, told the newspaper that she considered not running this year but did so partly out of duty. She also said she had made up her mind before she announced she was running that it would be her last campaign.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's strong showing in Missouri in 2016 en route to winning the presidency, McCaskill said she felt obliged \"to stand and fight and not just walk off the field. And so we gave it our best. But I am really at peace about being done.\"\n\nDanforth, who has served as United Nations ambassador and in a variety of governmental roles since retiring from the Senate, was among those who called her the day after the election, McCaskill said.\n\n\"She has got a lot of life ahead of her,\" Danforth said of McCaskill. \"There are a lot of opportunities for people who want to continue to be engaged.\"\n\nMcCaskill leaves a Congress torn over Trump's agenda. Lawmakers also face a potential constitutional showdown over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election and the Trump campaign.\n\nMcCaskill said she has no idea what Mueller will ultimately conclude, but warned: \"If it continues down the path it appears to be going, my colleagues here \u2014 if more of them don't speak up \u2014 I think they will have a crisis.\"\n\nShe said Trump's Republican allies in Congress \"are all conflicted right now. They don't know what to do. All you have to do is look at the state of Missouri, where Trump's blessing was all a Republican needed. So you want to risk that if he is not going down?

When she has severe episodes, known as crises, her grades drop.\n\nSickle cell anemia affects red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\nCells that are normally round become hard and look like the C-shaped farm tool called a sickle. They get stuck in blood vessels, causing pain. The cells also die early, causing a constant shortage of red blood cells.\n\nShattered dreams\n\n\n\nTwenty-four-year old Blaise Fora said his hopes of getting married were shattered because he is a sickle cell patient.\n\nHe said he has decided to remain single because when he fell in love once and was preparing to get married, his fiancee's family was vehemently opposed. They did not want him to - in their words - contaminate their daughter with sickle cell.\n\nFora said the family was concerned that the couple's children might be born with the disease. Those types of concerns are shared by many people, and aid agencies are responding by suggesting couples that are about to marry to get genetic tests done first.\n\nHaminatu Hadza Karim from Chad, is among those leading the largely informal campaign, organized by associations of sickle cell patients.\n\nShe says many of the women she works with have been thrown out by their husbands for delivering babies with sickle cell. She says she invites other women dealing with these prejudices to join them so they can fight for their rights and eradicate the disease.\n\nGenetic counseling\n\n\n\nSome people have the sickle cell trait without having the disease. To pass on the disease to a baby, both parents must be carriers.\n\nDr. Oumar Zacki, who takes care of sickle cell patients in Garoua, says a lack of genetic counseling means many people are without crucial knowledge.\n\nHe says the population of Central and West Africa move about with no visible symptoms but who carry sickle cell genes, passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance.\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Ghana and Nigeria, between 20 and 30 percent of the population carries the sickle cell trait. In Uganda, more than 40 percent carry the trait."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Pakistan Hosts Regional Meeting on Countering Afghan Opiates", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-regional-meeting-on-countering-afghan-opiates/4697559.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran have pledged to increase cooperation and information-sharing for effectively combating the trafficking of Afghan opiates.\n\nWar-shattered Afghanistan remains the world\u2019s largest producer of opium, though the U.N.

And today, as Theresa May faces an existential threat to her premiership, a similar flaw is evident in the Tory party\u2019s leadership rules. MPs can get rid of May without having a replacement lined up. They can have their moment of \u2018we\u2019re free!\u2019 cartharsis, but once the exhilarating whiff of liberation has faded, the realisation dawns that their leap of faith is a leap into the unknown. The instability and uncertainty of alternative options has been the threat that has kept May in power since her disastrous snap election. Yet for many of her MPs, May\u2019s exit (can we call it Mexit?) is worth the risk.\n\nAfter Tory backbenchers decided to \u2018take back control\u2019 of their party leadership, they will know that any replacement PM would face the exact same Parliamentary arithmetic and the exact same deadlock over Brexit. That arithmetic can only be changed by a general election, an election that many Tory MPs in marginal seats simply can\u2019t countenance because of the real threat of Jeremy Corbyn running yet another poll-defying election campaign that could make him Prime Minister.\n\nThe Christmas chaos that this contest could provoke is obvious. It\u2019s possible that under the newly centralised party membership system, a ballot could be held by email, but many members would want a postal vote. Add in hustings around the country, and it could be that it is the New Year before a contest could be realistically staged, May\u2019s allies will war. That would mean May would stay on as \u2018caretaker\u2019 PM while her party picks a successor. When Owen Paterson was this morning asked when a new leader could be in place, he replied: \u201cI would have thought mid-January\u2026I\u2019m not an expert.\u201d Then again, maybe Britain has indeed had \u2018enough\u2019 of experts.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss details of the large and ongoing investigation.\n\nSenior Interior Ministry official Laurent Nunez said the man had been radicalized in prison and had been monitored by French intelligence services since his release from jail in late 2015, because of his suspected religious extremism.\n\nNunez, secretary of state for the Interior Ministry, said on France-Inter radio that police sought to arrest the man on Tuesday morning, hours before the shooting, in relation to an attempted murder. He was not at home but five other people were detained, authorities said.\n\nThe government raised the security alert level and sent police reinforcements to Strasbourg, where more than 350 security forces were involved in the massive manhunt. Police officials said he was wounded in a gunfight with soldiers after the Tuesday night attack but escaped, and a top official said he might have fled to neighboring Germany.\n\nChristian Hartmann / Reuters Some 350 security forces and two helicopters were searching for the assailant.\n\nA terrorism investigation was opened, but the motive of the attack is unclear. Nunez said eight of the injured are in serious condition, and the city mayor said some had head wounds.\n\nWitnesses described shots and screams after the gunman opened fire around the Christmas market Tuesday evening in a city that\u2019s home to the European Parliament and considers itself a capital of Europe \u2014 and promotes itself as the \u201ccapital of Christmas.\u201d For several hours swaths of the city were under lockdown.\n\nThe suspected attacker also had a criminal record in Germany. He was convicted of robbery in Germany in 2016 and sentenced to two years and three months in prison for breaking into a dental practice and a pharmacy in two German towns.\n\nThe 2016 verdict from a district court in the southern German city of Singen, obtained by The Associated Press, also said he was sentenced to prison in France in 2008 and in Basel, Switzerland in 2013 for various robberies. News agency dpa reported that he was deported to France in 2017.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Witnesses described hearing gunshots, screams and shouts of police officers.\n\nAccording to that verdict, the suspected attacker grew up with six siblings in Strasbourg, worked for local authorities after leaving school and had been unemployed since 2011. He said that he had been traveling a lot and had already spent four years of his life in prison. The German robberies took place in Mainz, near Frankfurt, in 2012 and in Engen, near the Swiss border, in 2016.\n\nThe attack is a new blow to France, which saw a wave of Islamic extremist killings in 2015 and 2016. It came amid a month of protests against President Emmanuel Macron that have blocked roads around the country, led to rioting in the capital and put heavy strain on police.\n\nWhile authorities urged people in the area to stay inside after Tuesday\u2019s attack, Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries told BFM television Wednesday that \u201clife must go on\u201d so that the city doesn\u2019t cede to a \u201cterrorist who is trying to disrupt our way of life.\u201d\n\nThe assailant got inside a security zone around the venue and opened fire from there, Mayor Roland Ries said on BFM television.\n\nChristian Hartmann / Reuters Authorities had urged the public to remain indoors at the height of the drama.\n\nPolice were out in force in Strasbourg, a city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Paris on France\u2019s border with Germany, on Wednesday morning. The Christmas market, a holiday tradition there, was closed. The market was the target of an al-Qaida-linked plot at the turn of the millennium.\n\nMany of Europe\u2019s deadliest terror attacks in recent years have taken place in France. In response to Tuesday\u2019s shooting, the government decided to take the country\u2019s attack risk up a level on the official threat index and to send security reinforcements to Strasbourg, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in Strasbourg.\n\nSome 350 officers and two helicopters were searching for the assailant after Tuesday\u2019s drama, which involved shooting in multiple neighborhoods of Strasbourg, authorities said. The assailant confronted law enforcement officers twice, exchanging fire, while he \u201csowed terror,\u201d Castaner said.\n\nSEBASTIEN BOZON via Getty Images France has been hit in recent years with high-profile extremist attacks.\n\nThe shooter was shot and wounded by soldiers guarding the Christmas market, according to Stephane Morisse of police union FGP Police.\n\n\u201cI heard two or three shots at around 7:55 p.m., then I heard screams. I got close to the window. I saw people running. After that I closed the shutters. Then I heard more shots, closer this time,\u201d said Yoann Bazard, 27, who lives in central Strasbourg.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe it\u2019s firecrackers,\u201d he said, speaking by phone. \u201cAnd then, as it got close, it was really shocking.

There were police or soldiers shouting \u2018Get inside!\u2019 and \u2018Put your hands on your head.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother witness, Peter Fritz, told the BBC one of the three people killed was a Thai tourist who was shot in the head and didn\u2019t respond to lengthy attempts to revive him."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Knives Out For Theresa May\u2019s Whips Office As Her Brexit Plan Teeters On The Edge Of Collapse", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theresa-may-whips-office-brexit-vote-postponed_us_5c0fb2f7e4b08bcb27ec914c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The first wobble came on Saturday. After weeks of refusing to budge on plans to hold a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, Theresa May let slip to staff that maybe, just maybe, there could be movement.\n\nOn Sunday, the clamour from key cabinet ministers for a postponement grew louder. When she rang Irish PM Leo Varadkar and the EU\u2019s Donald Tusk, May still insisted she was pressing on with the vote planned for Tuesday. But they were told it would be easier to sell the deal to her MPs if she had some extra assurances on the vexed issue of Northern Ireland. Once more, the idea of Britain pleading for more time became palpable.\n\nAnd yet even if Brussels smelled doubt and could feel the timetable slipping, some around her felt that May still wanted to stick to Tuesday. As he was briefed on how to handle the breakfast media on Monday morning, Michael Gove was certainly convinced the famously stubborn PM was not for turning. In a pool clip for TV, he said not once but three times that the vote would go ahead as planned.\n\nWithin minutes of Gove\u2019s broadcast round ending, cabinet were told to expect an emergency conference call. The ministers who had been pushing for a delay knew at that point they had won. When the call was made, at 11.30am, there was no dissent.\n\nOstensibly, the cabinet was being \u2018consulted\u2019 but in fact Chief Whip Julian Smith and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson were among eight ministers who had driven the postponement. The PM had been left with little choice. Unsurprisingly, the news was leaked within seconds.\n\nWhen May got up in the Commons to confirm the news, there was a mix of derision and laughter from Opposition benches - and stony silence from the Tory benches behind her. \u201cOn one issue, the Northern Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern\u2026\u201d she admitted.\n\nThe House was packed tighter than a Budget Day, with cabinet ministers David Gauke, Chris Grayling, Damian Hinds, Jeremy Wright, Karen Bradley forced to stand. Gove arrived late, his earlier broadcast humiliation still ringing in his ears.\n\nReuters Theresa May in the House of Commons\n\nThe Chief Whip was initially missing from his perch at the end of the government front bench, but arrived mid-way through the PM\u2019s statement. \u201cThere is such a weird, unsettling atmosphere in here,\u201d one former minister told HuffPost via text. \u201cJulian looks like he\u2019s just eaten a wasp\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most wounding of all the criticism May suffered during another gruelling, three-hour session came from Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the DUP. \u201cFrankly, what the Prime Minister says today simply is not credible, is it?... Please, Prime Minister, really do start to listen and come back with changes to the withdrawal agreement, or it will be voted down.\u201d\n\nAs Dodds spoke, Gavin Williamson, who had also entered the chamber late behind the Speaker\u2019s chair, was looking avidly at his smartphone. It was apt that he was operating literally behind the scenes, because in many ways it has been Williamson - the former Chief Whip who hammered out the DUP-Tory alliance in the days after the snap election disaster - who has quietly tried to save the PM from herself in recent weeks.\n\nFor some Tory backbenchers, the most telling vignette came on the night of November 19. The DUP had just fired a \u2018warning shot\u2019 across the bows of the government by voting with Labour and against the Tories on the Budget.\n\nIn the wood-panelled Members\u2019 Dining Room overlooking the Thames, Williamson decided to sit with DUP MPs and chat to his old friends to rebuild bridges, despite their apparent break with the confidence and supply agreement that props May up in power.\n\nYet when Chief Whip Julian Smith happened to arrive in the same room, he acknowledged his colleague but blanked the entire DUP gathering. The snub did not go unnoticed. \u201cHe was incapable of dealing with disappointment and of moving on to the next vote,\u201d one backbencher said.\n\nThe DUP also \u2018heartily loathe\u2019 new Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, another MP confided. \u201cShe makes absolutely zero effort to understand them.\u201d The minister\u2019s admission in a House magazine interview in the summer, that she hadn\u2019t previously realised that nationalists and loyalists vote along sectarian lines, was just one example.\n\nPOOL New / Reuters DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson and then Government Chief Whip Gavin Williamson in 2016\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s beloved by the DUP. He gets their concerns, they have contempt for Bradley and for their official handlers, Damian Green and then Lidington, aren\u2019t on their wavelength at all. So even if they had been minded to dilute the sell-out, they were in no shape to sell it,\u201d says one who knows the Northern Irish party well.\n\nMoreover, Williamson \u2013 who actually proposed that May should give the DUP ministerial posts in 2016 - has told friends that \u201cburning the DUP is madness\u201d. He sees the danger as a threat to the life of the Parliament, May\u2019s main weapon with the vast bulk of Tory MPs, who are indifferent to Brexit either way.\n\nBut most of all it is the Whips\u2019 Office under Smith that is being held responsible for the fiasco of the last few weeks, with its roots starting last year.\n\nHe is being blamed for misreading last summer how dangerous it was to break with precedent and force MPs to abstain on Opposition Day motions. And when Labour started using an ancient procedural device of a \u2018Humble Address\u2019 to force the government to act on key issues like releasing Brexit impact assessments, Smith failed to spot how toxic it would ultimately become.\n\nSmith\u2019s allies point out he\u2019s lost just a handful of votes since taking over in 2017, no mean achievement given the wafer-thin, DUP-backed majority. Still, the \u201963 minutes of May-hem\u2019 last week, in which the Government lost three votes in quick succession, is what critics say confirmed the whips\u2019 failure to carry out their basic duty: \u2018count and then warn\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey should have spotted they were going to lose the Contempt of Parliament motion and pulled that vote and published the Attorney General\u2019s legal advice,\u201d one Tory MP said. \u201cThey got their numbers wrong, badly wrong. If they\u2019d got it right, we wouldn\u2019t be in the mess we are now.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the government whips\u2019 office seemed split on the Dominic Grieve amendment that aimed to give parliament more of a say on Brexit alternatives. One whip confided that they felt as if the chief and his deputy, Chris Pincher, were actually encouraging some MPs to back the Grieve plan, while others were advised by more junior whips to oppose it. \u201cIt\u2019s like they so wanted to scare Brexiteers, they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing,\u201d one of those involved said.\n\nHuffPost Michael Gove was among the ministers to insist the deal would go ahead.\n\nEach junior whip has to tend their \u2018flock\u2019 of MPs, normally split up on a regional basis. But several backbenchers have been surprised that their whips appear to have given up on them, and that the PM showed no interest in meeting them.\n\nPincher, known as \u2018Pinch\u2019 to colleagues, is now getting his own share of the blame. \u201cHe\u2019s got no relationship with the DUP and has no idea about policy. The best whips know the policy and the numbers, these guys know neither,\u201d one particularly furious rebel said. \u201cJulian is so often at No.10, it\u2019s Pinch who is the one over here [in the Commons]. And it ain\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nWith the big Brexit vote now expected to be delayed until January, one MP ridiculed the recent whips\u2019 empty threat to make parliament sit longer to eat into their festive break. \u201cIt\u2019s the Pinch who stole Christmas! He can\u2019t count so he\u2019s lucky there\u2019s an advent calendar to help tell him which day is which.\u201d Others point out that Pincher earns the same salary as the Chief Whip [\u00a3109,000]. \u201cIf the PM needs a scalp, surely it\u2019s his that\u2019s for the taking?\u201d\n\nOne grandee said that the most telling incident in recent days was that many MPs had gone to Williamson rather than Smith to pass on their concerns that the party would split if May went ahead with the vote. And Cabinet ministers relate that Smith has gone from reassuring the PM that she had \u2018the numbers\u2019 to becoming one of those warning postponement was vital to protecting the Government.\n\nWhat still rankles for many on the Labour side is the way Smith personally ordered Tory MPs to break their \u2018pair\u2019 with Opposition MPs to win a vote on the Trade Bill this summer. Party chairman Brandon Lewis was told to vote even though he paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who had only recently given birth.\n\nOpposition whips are reluctant to criticise their opposite numbers and in many ways sympathise, though not for long.\n\n\u201cWhips always get the blame when things go wrong but rarely get the credit when things go right,\u201d one said. \u201cBut the government\u2019s big mistake is trying to build relationships with MPs only at times of trouble.\u201d Labour also sees the Smith set-up as very hierarchical, with junior whips unable to be trusted with delegation. Every decision goes through \u2018The Chief\u2019, as he is known.\n\nMost puzzling to Labour has been the total absence of any attempt by either the whips or No.10 to engage with MPs in Leave seats who could possibly be tempted to back May\u2019s deal as at least a way of delivering the 2016 referendum. MPs like Lisa Nandy had no contact at all.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds\n\nOthers on the Tory side point out that the entire government whips\u2019 office lacks experienced, older hands needed to calm nerves in what is increasingly feeling like a minority government. As the ConservativeHome website has pointed out, Smith and Pincher and their loyal colleague Mark Spencer have been in post just two-and-a-half years, and the rest of their team on average just 18 months. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t any grown ups,\u201d one rebel says.\n\nTo make things worse, May has removed some of the better rated whips out into ministerial office. Former ministers who have sent warning shots in various votes have been ignored. Those with experience of Northern Ireland have not been approached for advice on handling the DUP either.\n\nDefenders of the whips say they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for what are ultimately Downing Street\u2019s tactical and strategical errors. Triggering Article 50 too early, ramping up expectation of a hard Brexit, triggering a doomed snap election, misreading the DUP a year ago, and even creating a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 are all blunders laid at the door of May and her top team.\n\nOne loyalist MP also pointed out that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his European Research Group allies had proved even worse \u2018counters\u2019 than the whips, not least when it comes to the 48 signatures needed for a vote of confidence. Yet the ERG has in fact deployed a disciplined whipping operation when its votes are needed to send a message to the PM, a former minister said.\n\nOthers sympathise that this set of whips is facing a group of hardened Brexiteer rebels who have learned from the Maastricht rebellions under John Major in the 1990s. Crucially, they have built an almost impregnable alliance with the DUP.\n\nIronically portraits of some of May\u2019s strongest critics, like David Davis and Michael Fallon, stare down from the Cabinet Office walls near No.9 Downing Street, official home of the Chief Whip. Both Davis and Fallon were whips themselves, and know all the tricks of the trade.\n\nOne incident last week highlighted the inadequacies in the current set-up. When \u2018independent\u2019 backbenchers tabled an amendment to give Parliament more of a say over the \u2018backstop\u2019, a trio of Hugo Swire, Bob Neill and Richard Graham were all keen to stress it was one way to prod the Government into assuaging Brexiteers\u2019 fears.\n\nHowever, the semblance of independence was blown when Pincher allowed himself to be spotted in the Commons Table Office, literally signing an extra name to the amendment. The fiction that this was anything other than a Government ploy was swiftly exposed.\n\nOne Tory had Pincher on the phone asking him to \u2018consider\u2019 signing the Swire amendment. When told it wouldn\u2019t solve deeper problems, the Deputy Chief Whip said he wanted names \u201ceven if you don\u2019t like it because we want to make sure the Speaker selects it.\u201d It was also pointed out that the motion was vital to showing the broader views of the Commons, as a counterbalance to the Hilary Benn motion (opposing \u2018no deal\u2019), if both should be passed.\n\nITV News was granted rare access to the Chief Whip's office, as he tries to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal ahead of Tuesday's vote.\n\nWe caught the argument as vocal Brexiteer Philip Davies insisted he was voting 'no' https://t.co/KHDQTdnQtA pic.twitter.com/MJjE7vdaXb \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) December 6, 2018\n\nSmith\u2019s decision to allow in the ITV News cameras to follow his efforts to win round MPs was also seen as woefully na\u00efve, given he later had to tell the PM he just couldn\u2019t win the vote. No.10 found out about the plan a week after the filming started, one source confided.\n\nOn Monday evening, the chaotic nature of this \u2018zombie\u2019 government on its most shambolic day yet was underlined with yet more ridicule. In line with convention, a junior whip tried to shout \u2018tomorrow!\u2019 to formally defer the Brexit vote to an unspecified date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common in the House to say \u2018tomorrow\u2019, this allow the Government to bring back a debate on a date of its choosing. This does not mean the debate will continue tomorrow,\u201d a No.10 source said.\n\nThe move worked, but it left a sour taste in the mouth of both Tory Brexiteers and Labour MPs. Veteran Conservative Peter Bone complained that he wanted Parliament to decide its own timetable, Labour wags heckled \u2018manana!\u2019\n\nLabour\u2019s Helen Goodman channelled Macbeth. \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day ..will it also be to the last syllable of recorded time?\u201d With Tory leadership contenders all gearing up for a Shakesperean contest of thwarted and unsated ambition, all eyes are indeed on the few days and weeks ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018The Chief\u2019 likes to joke to colleagues that he\u2019s had to deal with more sex scandals and reshuffles (nine in total) than he\u2019d bargained for.

It appeared to be a pre-emptive move to protect the Trump administration\u2019s Yemen policy because the Democratic-backed measure held privileged status, which meant it had to be considered, and its advocates were seeking to bring it up soon after expected passage of a similar bill in the Senate as a way to send an even stronger rebuke of the kingdom and a military campaign held largely responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had already stripped privilege from similar legislation almost immediately after beginning the lame duck session, but his maneuver this week is far more dramatic because it blocks the current Yemen bill and any other similar legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said the measure\u2019s principal author.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who has pushed proposals targeting the Yemen policy throughout the current congressional term. \u201cSpeaker Ryan is preventing Congress from conducting our constitutional duty and \u2026 breaking the rules of the House. While this is happening, the United States Senate is debating and voting on this issue.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders Reps. Steny Hoyer (Md.), Adam Smith (Wash.) and Eliot Engel (N.Y.), were united behind Khanna\u2019s Yemen proposal, and a mix of absences and GOP opposition to the rule meant that had the Democrats held the line, it would have forced Republicans to remove the language on the Yemen debate. Eighteen Republicans voted against the rule \u2015 a rare act of floor defiance, as rule votes almost always go along party lines.\n\nBut support from those five Democrats \u2015 Jim Costa (Calif.), Al Lawson (Fla.), Collin Peterson (Minn.), Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.) and David Scott (Ga.) \u2015 meant Ryan\u2019s gambit succeeded. Democratic opponents of the Yemen policy felt let down and were scrambling to understand why they lost those members, a congressional aide told HuffPost. Party activists like Tommy Vietor, a former aide to President Barack Obama, are already rallying opposition to the five online. \u201cAnyone want to primary some Democrats who voted to continue slaughtering civilians in Yemen?\u201d Vietor wrote on Twitter. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss.\u201d\n\nSome of those five Democrats might have been interested in preserving the glide path for the farm bill, but had the rule gone down, Republicans likely would have just removed the Yemen language and voted on the farm bill rule again, though GOP leaders could have inserted the War Powers provisions into a similar rule when they had fewer absences.\n\nPeterson, who is the ranking member on the Agriculture Committee and rallied Democratic votes to save the farm bill, told The Washington Post on Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I let anybody screw [the farm bill] up.\u201d\n\nHe added that he didn\u2019t know \u201ca damn thing\u201d about the war in Yemen but he didn\u2019t think the legislation the rule blocked would have done much. \u201cAll it did was say they couldn\u2019t have a vote or something.

Many of those Republicans were voted out of Congress on this past Election Day. But there were also six Democrats missing from the vote. Democrats could have blocked the rule if those Democrats had shown up and voted against it.\n\nOf the 18 Republicans who voted against the rule, at least 13 are members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The Freedom Caucus has traditionally opposed GOP leaders legislating on the rule \u2015 a tactic in which leadership uses a procedural vote like a rule to add, remove or block legislation.\n\nRepublicans once decried those procedural gimmicks, but they\u2019ve shown an increasing comfort with legislating on the rule.

Behind the scenes, Pecker agreed to go even further to help his friend become president, coordinating with Cohen in August 2015 to \u201cdeal with negative stories about\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201crelationships with women,\u201d a decision prosecutors say led to the McDougal deal.\n\nBut as outlined in AMI\u2019s agreement with the Justice Department, the company knew at the time that corporations are not legally allowed to make payments in hopes of influencing an election, and it did not tell the Federal Election Commission about the payment to McDougal.\n\nAs prosecutors zeroed in on the idea that AMI\u2019s payment could be considered as an illegal campaign contribution, Pecker ultimately decided to flip on his friend, agreeing to a deal with prosecutors this year that would grant him immunity in exchange for information related to payments made to McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels.

It\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Dr. Holly Hedegaard, lead author of the report and injury epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nMore than 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMost reports on drug overdose deaths only determine what class of drugs were involved. The new report, published Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics, analyzed the text of death certificates and compared it with National Vital Statistics System data, drilling down to determine the specific drug \u2015 not just the class of drugs \u2015 involved in overdose deaths from 2011 to 2016.\n\nWhat researchers found mirrored news reports in recent years. Oxycodone, which was the most common drug cited in fatal overdoses in 2011, was eclipsed by heroin from 2012 to 2015, and then fentanyl in 2016. On average, the U.S. death rate involving fentanyl increased about 113 percent per year from 2013 to 2016.\n\nIn most of these cases, the researchers found that more than one drug was used, and from those data they were able to identify the most common combinations of drugs that led to fatal overdoses.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to tease out what specific effect one drug had versus another used at the same time (or what other medical factors may have contributed to the deaths), better understanding these drug combinations \u201chelps us identify potential areas of risk,\u201d Hedegaard said. For instance, about 40 percent of cocaine deaths also involved fentanyl.\n\nBebeto Matthews/ASSOCIATED PRESS Heroin is prepared using a fentanyl test strip to check for contamination. A new report drilled down to determine the specific drug \u2015 not just the class of drugs \u2015 involved in overdose deaths from 2011 to 2016.\n\nHedegaard and her co-authors used the same death certificates that the CDC typically uses for overdose reports but went deeper in their analysis, scouring the records for drug misspellings, chemical names, brand names and street names recorded by coroners and medical examiners.\n\nThe amount and quality of information on the reports varied widely. Death investigations, resources and reporting requirements differ from county to county and state to state, and medical examiners and coroners are a patchwork of officials and an unregulated group. In some municipalities, coroner is an elected or appointed position, not necessarily a medical doctor.\n\nThough reporting by medical examiners and coroners improved over the course of the report, Hedegaard noted, in 2016, 15 percent of drug overdose death certificates still didn\u2019t include any specific drug.\n\nAfter an in-depth analysis of the information, the researchers also found that certain drugs were more likely to be the cause of death in unintentional overdoses, while others were more likely to be implicated in death by suicide. In 2016, the street drugs fentanyl, heroin and cocaine were most frequently recorded in unintentional fatal overdoses, while prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including oxycodone, diphenhydramine, hydrocodone and alprazolam, were most frequently recorded in deaths by suicide.\n\nBetter understanding those patterns could help experts and policymakers who are working to end the nation\u2019s suicide and overdose crises."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "I\u2019m A Man And It Took Me Years To Recognize I Had Been Sexually Assaulted", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/men-sexual-assault_us_5c095ca1e4b0bf813ef54bb8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "If I could find a way to discuss the complexities of men\u2019s ability to admit when they\u2019ve been made victims of sexual assault without actually recounting my personal experience with it, I\u2019d do it. I can\u2019t.\n\nI still have trouble referring to what happened to me as assault. In fact, I utilize Olympic-level mental gymnastics to avoid that terminology, usually saying that I was on the receiving end of \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d or \u201cwas taken advantage of physically.\u201d It took me a year-and-a-half to even admit to myself that I wasn\u2019t OK with what happened, and another year for me to acknowledge the same thing to someone else.\n\nI was 23 years old, still in college (not-so-fun fact: male college students ages 18 to 24 are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted than members of the same demographic who aren\u2019t in college) and attending a massive event for the industry in which I was just starting to find my footing. At a large party the first night of the event, I was introduced to someone with whom I was familiar through social media. It was immediately evident she wasn\u2019t sober.\n\nAfter what I\u2019d generously estimate to be 90 seconds of small talk, she leaned forward and stuck her tongue down my throat. I pulled back. She proceeded to do it again twice more. I made a clumsy exit from the interaction, but periodically throughout the night she\u2019d find me again and make further drunken passes at me, both physical and verbal. For further context, she was several years older than me and had rising stock in our industry. I was still very much at the bottom of the proverbial totem pole.\n\nWhen I went back to my hotel that night, something felt off. There was a little voice in the back of my head telling me that something about what had happened wasn\u2019t normal, wasn\u2019t appropriate. I stifled that voice. In fact, the next morning, to cover up my abstract shame and discomfort (and to get ahead of any potential embarrassment had somebody seen it) I did the only thing I knew how to do: I bragged about it. I did everything I could to turn it into a crazy party story. I even instigated further contact with her, going so far as to try and see her a few nights later. See? I was OK. I was an active participant in the story, not a victim. Everything was fine.\n\nBut in the months that followed, I began to have panic attacks whenever I saw her at industry events. It only worsened when, in the midst of an interaction with a mutual friend, she joked about what had happened. I realized I never wanted to be in the same room as her again. The problem is that we worked in the same industry, so we were in the same room together often. Rather than speak up or seek closure (whatever that even means in situations like these), I let my feelings fester, until I slowly felt less and less at home in the environment I had worked so hard to earn my place in.\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t recognize what happened as sexual assault. I wouldn\u2019t let myself. Because there\u2019s a huge difference between recognizing that men can be victims of sexual assault and recognizing that you, a man, have been made a victim of sexual assault.\n\nI think one of the greatest fears men are conditioned to hold, even if they don\u2019t realize it, is the loss of autonomy. You are the master of your decisions and of your body. You are, at all times, In Control. To admit that you\u2019re a victim is to relinquish that fabrication of control. Admitting to yourself that you\u2019ve already lost it can break you.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a stereotype in our society that men are, well, always down for sex. A guy can\u2019t be the victim of an unwanted sexual advance because there\u2019s no such thing as a guy who isn\u2019t receptive to ANY sexual advance, at ANY time. Hell, men who do come forward with allegations of sexual assault are often told by someone (usually with an egg avatar on Twitter) that they\u2019re lucky, that they should be thankful for the experience, that they have nothing to complain about.\n\nSo, for nearly two years, I pretended I was OK with what had happened. I never let myself say the words \u201charassment\u201d or \u201cassault\u201d or \u201cvictim\u201d out loud, and every time they\u2019d pop into my head I\u2019d remind myself that I couldn\u2019t have been assaulted \u2015 if I were assaulted, why would I have kept talking to her? After all, I didn\u2019t not want to kiss her, I just didn\u2019t want to do it at that time, and that place, when she were in that condition. Plus it wasn\u2019t like I was, God forbid, forced into sex or anything. What did I have to complain about?\n\nI thought this in total ignorance of facts I already knew to be true \u2015 that victims often return to the people who assault them and try to make peace, and that mutual attraction doesn\u2019t negate a lack of consent. But of course, recognizing these things would mean admitting that I was a victim.\n\nIt\u2019s been some time now since the session with my therapist in which I finally realized that what happened wasn\u2019t consensual, and admitted to myself that I had been sexually assaulted. While it\u2019s still not something I share details of openly, the few friends and peers I\u2019ve talked about it with have been supportive and receptive, wholly understanding the situation and never questioning my take on the experience. I\u2019m lucky I was given the space to realize this, to admit that something had happened to me that contradicted my self-constructed identity as a \u201cman.\u201d\n\nUltimately, admitting you\u2019ve been assaulted doesn\u2019t signify a loss of autonomy or control \u2015 quite the opposite. To take control of your experiences and admit that something bad happened is taking back control. It\u2019s counteracting the negative stigma surrounding men openly discussing sexual assault. The toxicity of conditioned masculinity is a hell of a drug, though, and reaching a point where you\u2019re comfortable taking back that control can be daunting.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for the dialogue started by the Me Too movement and specifically Terry Crews sharing his experience with assault over the last year. It\u2019s created a space in which it feels safer for everyone, including men, to discuss the trauma that comes with being a victim of assault \u2015 a great deal of which is often self-inflicted.\n\nHowever, my situation isn\u2019t unique. I know men who have managed to convince themselves that they weren\u2019t assaulted, who have utilized the same mental gymnastics to remove the stigma of victimhood from their identity. It\u2019s not a healthy way to think.\n\nIn our ongoing and expanding dialogue on the nature of sexual assault, I only hope that we continue to encourage men to feel safe in recognizing their experiences with it. Vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness and victimhood need not be a badge of shame."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

That being said, she carries on. But she\u2019s back where she left off with the Brexit deal.\u201d\n\nMrs. May has long been known for her unruffled exterior, which earned her the nickname \u201cthe Ice Queen of Westminster.\u201d Her approach to obstacles has been to ignore them. An aide once described Mrs. May holding a news conference in a basement room that was suddenly cast into pitch darkness by a power outage. Instead of pausing or even remarking on it, she simply called out \u201cnext question\u201d and continued as if nothing had happened.\n\nThis was her approach on Wednesday, to plow on. Those looking for signs of fragility could spot only one, minor tell: Her husband, Philip, was in sitting in the gallery for Question Time, such an unusual occurrence that The Daily Mail covered it as a separate story, under the headline, \u201cHusband Goals.\u201d\n\nThe awkward timing of the leadership challenge, with a countdown ticking to the March 29 Brexit deadline, may have worked in her favor, some observers said. Its failure provides Mrs. May with a degree of protection, since according to Tory rules, rebel members can call a no-confidence vote only once a year.\n\n\u201cI think maybe there is a degree of emotional release that the moment has finally come,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cI think she was aware that this was a possibility for two or three weeks, and now that it\u2019s happened at least things are out in the open and the battle can be joined.\u201d\n\nModeration has been Mrs. May\u2019s selling point the whole time. In the chaotic wake of the 2016 referendum, she offered herself to the country as a pair of \u201csafe hands,\u201d the epitome of old-fashioned, small-c conservatism in a time of turmoil.

Pecker, had previously claimed it had paid $150,000 to the model, Karen McDougal, to secure the rights to publish her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. But the company never published it, and people familiar with its operations had said it was part of a longstanding practice, known in the tabloid trade as \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d to suppress damaging stories about favored people.\n\nProsecutors said that Mr. Cohen had intended to reimburse A.M.I. for its payment to Ms. McDougal by arranging a bogus $125,000 fee to an A.M.I. affiliate for \u201cadvisory services.\u201d Although Mr. Pecker signed off on the deal, he later contacted Mr. Cohen and called it off. He also instructed Mr. Cohen to tear up the paperwork, prosecutors said.\n\nIn addition to McDougal, Mr. Cohen said he arranged a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, to squelch her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. He said that he used his own money, but that Mr. Trump had agreed to pay him back, with the reimbursement eventually being couched as legal fees billed to the Trump Organization.\n\nA.M.I. was also involved in the early stages of Mr. Cohen\u2019s dealings with Ms. Daniels. Rather than pay her, as it did with Ms. McDougal, the company notified Mr. Cohen that she was trying to sell her story.\n\nUntil this week, it was largely Mr. Cohen\u2019s word against the president\u2019s denials.

It\u2019s that we\u2019re going over their records with much greater scrutiny, and we\u2019re able to obtain more information\u201d because of social media, he said. \u201cBoth parties now are a lot less willing to give nominees the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nBut the selection of more contentious nominees has befuddled others within the party. Mr. Scott told reporters this month, \u201cThere are a lot of folks that can be judges, in states including North Carolina, besides Tom Farr.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Troubled by Lapses, Government\u2019s Voice to the World Braces for New Trump Management", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/voice-of-america-trump.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Mr. Pack, who is awaiting Senate confirmation, has collaborated on films with Mr. Bannon, a former head of Breitbart News, and has asserted that liberal political correctness is stifling the documentary film industry.

Weight training may not have the same effect, the study found, raising interesting questions about how various types of exercise affect us at a microscopic level and whether the differences should perhaps influence how we choose to move.\n\nThere is mounting and rousing evidence that being physically active affects how we age, with older people who exercise typically being healthier, more fit, better muscled and less likely to develop a variety of diseases and disabilities than their sedentary peers. But precisely how, at an interior, molecular level, exercise might be keeping us youthful has not been altogether clear. Past studies have shown that exercise alters the workings of many genes, as well as the immune system, muscle-repair mechanisms and many other systems within the body.\n\nSome researchers have speculated that the most pervasive anti-aging effects of exercise may occur at the tips of our chromosomes, which are capped with tiny bits of matter known as telomeres. Telomeres seem to protect our DNA from damage during cell division but, unfortunately, shorten and fray as a cell ages. At some point, they no longer safeguard our DNA, and the cell becomes frail and inactive or dies.\n\nMany scientists believe that telomere length is a useful measure of a cell\u2019s functional age.\n\nBut researchers also have found that telomeres are mutable. They can be lengthened or shortened by lifestyle, including exercise. A 2009 study, for instance, found that middle-aged competitive runners tended to have much longer telomeres than inactive people of the same age. Their telomeres were, in fact, almost as lengthy of those of healthy, young people. But that study was associational; it showed only that older people who ran also were people with extended telomeres, not that the exercise necessarily caused that desirable condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "MIND: Can We Really Inherit Trauma?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/mind-epigenetics-genes.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "One working theory is based on animal research. In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M. Greally, a professor of genetics, medicine, and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. \u201cBut as usual, the story that\u2019s often told is overblown relative to the results, and too much causality is claimed.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Is Screen Time Bad for Kids\u2019 Brains?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/screen-time-kids-psychology.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nHave any such brain differences been found?\n\nNot convincingly. More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what the N.I.H. study aims to address?\n\nYes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain. Since then, the project has expanded, and now includes other targets such as the effects of brain injury, screen time, genetics, and an array of \u201cother environmental factors.\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Can We Ever Be Truly Fearless?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/well/mind/fear-psychology-trauma-stress.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "What happens when you face your worst fear?
