There is every chance that things will not go well.\n\nThat's because Pelosi is now the face of the congressional oversight and investigation from which Trump was spared by two years of GOP rule on Capitol Hill and that now threatens his presidency itself.\n\nIt's not just that Pelosi and Trump are political and temperamental opposites. Hanging over their most critical relationship is the possibility that she has the power to open impeachment proceedings should special counsel Robert Mueller deliver a damning verdict on Trump.\n\nAs she was sworn in Thursday, the California Democrat preached action on boosting the middle class, combating climate change, shielding children brought to the US by undocumented parents, gender equality and opening up government.\n\nBut she also fired several warnings at the President, notably by passing legislation to reopen the government that ignored his demands for border wall funding as the first bill of the new Democratic majority.\n\n\"We're not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? So that's that,\" she said at a news conference on Thursday evening.\n\nAnd playing on Trump's legal vulnerabilities, Pelosi had declined to rule out impeachment in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show and said it was an open question whether a president can be indicted.\n\nTrump laid the groundwork for his face-to-face encounter with his new top political foe by cementing his demands for wall funding in a hastily orchestrated appearance in the White House Briefing Room that signaled he was a long way from backing down on the shutdown.\n\n\"I have never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance for border security, for border control and for, frankly, the wall or the barrier,\" the President said, flanked by a group of Border Patrol Council members.\n\nPoor omens\n\nWhen Trump and then-House Minority Leader Pelosi last met, earlier this week at the White House, things headed south when the President ordered his homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, to brief lawmakers on border security. At one point, Trump's frustration boiled over at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the President lobbed a glowing personal letter from North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un in the direction of the New York Democrat.\n\nThat massive political disconnect is one reason why expectations are so low for Friday's meeting, along with the fact that at this point neither side seems to have an overwhelming incentive to make a deal.\n\nThe speaker has no desire to celebrate her new majority by giving Trump a win on the wall -- the symbol of his 2016 election victory, which broke Democratic hearts. Her position is supported by Schumer, whose minority party votes are needed to pass Senate funding legislation.\n\nTrump triggered the shutdown while facing a revolt from the conservative commentators who help keep his vital political base engaged -- a constituency at which Thursday's \"briefing\" appeared to be aimed . Climbing down now would expose him to even more of a backlash.\n\nThat's why it's tough to see a way out of the showdown that could allow Trump and Pelosi to both claim victory and build goodwill that might be used in pursuit of bipartisan initiatives -- for instance, an infrastructure package, or in future must-do items like budget bills or raising the debt ceiling.\n\nLittle in common\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump congratulates House Speaker Pelosi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump congratulates House Speaker Pelosi 02:08\n\nTrump and Pelosi could hardly be more different, so it's hard to see how they can forge any kind of bond in the weeks ahead.\n\nPelosi is a political lifer, steeped in the family business from an early age. Trump owes his stunning electoral success to the fact that he is not a politician at all.\n\nThe speaker, by securing a second run at the job despite early rumblings of dissent among younger Democrats, proved once again her mastery of Washington process. Her vote-counting prowess is especially remembered for pushing Obamacare into law during her first turn at running the House.\n\nTrump is a legislative neophyte, and despite enjoying a Republican monopoly on power for two years, his unpredictable nature was often more of a hindrance to his party in advancing its agenda than a help.\n\nPelosi is no stranger to fighting Republican presidents, even if memories are dimming of her bitter battles with President George W. Bush over funding the Iraq War.\n\nDespite their gaping differences, Pelosi and Bush had a cordial personal relationship. Their mutual respect was crucial to navigating the 2008 financial crisis and was in evidence when they hugged at former President George H.W. Bush's lying in state last month.\n\nTrump sought to build a personal rapport with Pelosi by congratulating her on her election as speaker.\n\n\"It's a very, very great achievement, and hopefully we're going to work together, and we're going to get lots of things done,\" he said.\n\nYet Trump is a far more volatile personality than Bush and often sees political differences in deeply personal terms. His default mode of projecting power is to identify an enemy and applying withering political fire.\n\nDan Meyer, who served Bush as deputy assistant for legislative affairs and also experienced shutdowns while working for Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, said the political dynamics of new majorities were often shaped by the issues that brought them to power.\n\n\"There is a different set of issues that brought this majority to power -- the most significant being the Democrats' resistance to President Trump,\" Meyer said.\n\n\"This is going to be much more difficult to do and not have it be personal. They are going to go after him hard,\" he said.\n\nIf that is how it goes, Pelosi will be ready, said Nadeam Elshami, an ex-chief of staff to Pelosi.\n\n\"She has the power to back it up. She has gone toe-to-toe with this President in the past two years,\" Elshami said on CNN's \"New Day,\" citing his former boss's \"resolve, her ability to understand the issues and her ability to look at the President and say, 'Mr President, you are wrong. These are not the facts.' \"\n\nDictating terms\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage 02:19\n\nThe differing approaches of Pelosi and Trump were on display Thursday.\n\nPelosi was legislating, passing the bill to reopen the government that put Republicans -- who had already passed a similar effort to keep the government open last month in the Senate -- in a difficult spot.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was presiding over the propaganda stunt in the White House Briefing Room, designed to change the subject from Pelosi's day of triumph and to provide footage for conservative news channels.\n\nThe Pelosi approach is designed to show that Democrats can govern and can provide stability after two years of chaos fostered by Trump's disruption.\n\nThe President appears to be betting that the longer the shutdown drags on, the more pressure Democrats will feel to end it as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.\n\nOr perhaps a prolonged shutdown could cause voters to sour on both parties and let the President off the hook.\n\nTrump's political team is trying to shape that outcome by portraying Pelosi as of an extreme band of liberals who are soft on immigration and blinded by a ravenous desire to destroy his presidency.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate that you've got an incoming speaker already talking about indictments and impeachment when this President is talking about border security and infrastructure,\" Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway said Thursday.\n\n\"She obviously came here yesterday not serious about border security, so it doesn't surprise me that she would be so partisan and political on day one. That's just too bad,\" Conway said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Pelosi's message to Trump as the press covers a 'power shift'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/j--d4Wc2Hjo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter.

She shouldn't have said that.\n\n\"You're welcome here anytime, Mr. President,\" a reporter said as Trump walked in the briefing room for the first time.\n\nThe event was newsworthy -- Trump defended his decision to force a partial government shutdown and encouraged several border patrol union officials to make remarks. Vox's Dara Lind summed up the message from the union this way: \"It's okay if our agents don't get paid on time, as long as we get the wall.\"\n\nBut it was not a press briefing, as advertised. It was a \"human long-form version of a presidential tweet,\" Hallie Jackson said on MSNBC.\n\nTrump evidently is not confident enough to take questions from the press corps right now. \"It's not a press briefing if you don't take questions,\" CNN's Kaitlan Collins said right afterward...\n\nWhen should Trump events be shown live?\n\nKatie Pellico emails: While CNN and Fox News kept Trump's surprise trip to the podium running live, MSNBC cut away.

Between December 27 and January 2, a total of 463 people died in 3,791 traffic accidents, pretty much on par with last year's 423 deaths, according to the country's Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimated 22,941 people die each year in traffic-related incidents in Thailand, making its roads the deadliest in Southeast Asia.\n\nThat's an average of 62 deaths every day, according to the WHO's 2018 report on global road safety -- just slightly fewer than the average deaths over the New Year period of 66 per day.\n\nThe vast majority of those deaths -- 73% -- are riders of motorcycles, which have exploded in numbers over the past few decades to become the most popular form of transport for most households in the country.\n\nLack of enforcement\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to safer roads is poor enforcement of traffic rules. The Interior Ministry's Road Safety Thailand unit said the majority of deaths during this New Year period (41.5%) were caused by drunk driving and 28% by speeding.\n\nThe northern province of Chiang Mai, which reported the second largest number of incidents this New Year period, with 16 deaths, is a case in point.\n\nIn recent years the number of police traffic stops around the provincial capital of the same name has increased and there are more signs ordering motorcyclists to wear helmets.\n\nBut in many areas of the city it seems the traffic stops are more about making money than road safety. It is common to see drivers in Chiang Mai being stopped by police for failing to produce a driving license or wear a helmet, only to jump back on their bikes and drive away once they've paid a \"fine\".\n\nNikorn Jumnong, former Deputy Transport Minister and Chairman of the People's Safety Foundation, told CNN that if road safety is to be improved, this kind of corruption needs to stop.\n\n\"That is one of our main problems, and it is a two-way problem. Corrupt law enforcers see loopholes (in the law) and the commuters are not following the law too,\" he said.\n\naccording to the WHO report. Nationwide, just over half of motorcycle drivers wear a helmet and a mere 20% of pillion passengers, and only 58% of car drivers wear seatbelts,according to the WHO report.\n\nWhile those figures are an improvement on a decade ago, the WHO estimated that if everyone wore a helmet it could prevent 40% of deaths\n\nIn addition to the failure to wear helmets and seatbelts, speeding, drunk driving, and a lack of restraints for children are among the biggest risks to road safety.\n\n\"We need to change the DNA (of the country) and our instinct to follow the laws,\" Nikorn said. \"Education on law enforcement is the key. We have so many laws and I think they are good and more than enough. But it is all about enforcement.\"\n\nThailand is making some progress.

But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.\n\nTo become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.\n\nAhead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.\n\n\"I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,\" Pelosi said in a statement at the time.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments from Thursday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Welcome to the new Congress.

The findings cannot prove that frequent social media use caused depressive symptoms, or vice versa.\n\nThe study also described other factors, such as lack of sleep and cyberbullying, that could help explain this association.\n\nExplanations for the gender gap\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data on 10,904 14-year-olds who were born between 2000 and 2002 in the United Kingdom. The data, which came from the UK Millennium Cohort Study , included information from questionnaires on the teens' depressive symptoms and social media use.\n\nDepressive symptoms were recorded as scores, and the researchers looked at which teens had high or low scores. They found that on average, girls had higher depressive symptom scores compared with boys.\n\nThe researchers also found that girls reported more social media use than boys; 43.1% of girls said they used social media for three or more hours per day, versus 21.9% of boys.\n\nWhen examining differences between girls and boys who spend the same amount of time on social media, the researchers found the stronger association between social media use and depressive symptoms for girls.\n\nThe data showed that for teens using social media for three to five hours, 26% of girls and 21% of boys had depressive symptom scores higher than those who used social media for only about one to three hours a day.\n\n\"For both girls and boys, the more social media they use, the more likely they are to have mental health problems, but not that many studies have been able to look for the explanations why,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"We looked at four potential explanations simultaneously, and this is the first paper to do that. We looked at sleeping habits; experiences online, so cyberbullying; how they thought about their bodies, or their body image, and whether they were happy with how they looked; and their self-esteem,\" she said. \"All of those four things -- the sleep, the cyberharassment, the body image or happiness with appearance, and the self-esteem -- they are all linked with the risk of having depression.\"\n\nIn other words, those experiences were tied to frequent social media use, which means they could play a role in the depressive symptoms. Among them, sleep and cyberbullying appeared to be the most important, Kelly said.\n\nAs for the big gender difference in the data, the study did not explore any explanations, but Kelly had some ideas.\n\n\"My best bet would be the types of things that girls and boys do online,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"In the UK, girls tend to more likely use things like Snapchat or Instagram, which is more based around physical appearance, taking photographs and commenting on those photographs,\" she said. \"I think it has to do with the nature of use.\"\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that the findings show only a correlation between depressive symptoms and social media use, not a causal relationship.\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether teens who have depressive symptoms are more likely to use social media, versus frequent social media use leading to depressive symptoms.\n\nAlso, the data in the study was self-reported from questionnaires, which runs the risk of a 14-year-old not accurately remembering or revealing the amount of time spent playing a game or watching a video on social media.\n\n'When it comes to depression, girls are more vulnerable'\n\nThe new study serves as \"a good addition to the literature on this important topic,\" said Dr. Anne Glowinski, professor of child psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis , who was not involved in the research.\n\n\"I would say that girls are, and have been for as long as measured, at a greater risk of depression than boys after puberty and that depression is a disorder which is caused by genetic and environmental, including social, determinants and their interaction,\" Glowinski said.\n\n\"If being online more is one of those social factors that makes the emergence of depression more likely -- as opposed to being online more representing already a symptom on the way to depression -- than it does not surprise me that there are gender differences and that girls are more vulnerable,\" she said. \"When it comes to depression, girls are more vulnerable.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Talking to teens about social media Replay More Videos ...

But now there is scientific evidence that respect can potentially save lives among the elderly and keep them both physically and mentally healthy.\n\nAn analysis by the global journalism network Orb Media found that countries with high levels of respect for the elderly recorded better health among older populations and lower poverty levels for over-60s.\n\nAs we enter a new phase of history -- with 2.1 billion people predicted to live beyond 60 by 2050 -- global attitudes toward older people have not kept up.\n\nIn a 2016 World Health Organization survey across 57 countries, 60% of respondents reported that older people are not respected.\n\nA more recent report by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK gauged the feelings of 2,000 British citizens and found some other bleak trends. Almost half -- 47% -- believed that people over 65 struggled to learn new skills. A quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds and 15% of the total respondents agreed that \"it is normal to be unhappy and depressed when you are old.\"\n\nBecca Levy, professor of public health and psychology at Yale School of Public Health, believes that negative attitudes are due to \"the growing medicalization of older adults\" and \"the growing anti-aging industry that promotes and actually profits from a fear of aging.\"\n\nBut in the UK alone, older people made net contributions to the economy of nearly 40 billion pounds (US $52.64 billion) during 2011, according to a 2011 analysis.\n\nThe dangers of stereotypes\n\nNegative stereotypes can be dangerous to older people in a number of ways, including shortening their lives.\n\nLevy analyzed interviews with 660 people from Oxford, Ohio, that were conducted over more than two decades and matched these with mortality information. Her team found that those with a positive attitude toward aging lived on average 7.5 years longer than those who viewed it as something bad.\n\n\"We were very surprised at this difference,\" said Levy, who believes that people with positive mindsets were able to live longer because positive attitudes can influence psychological, behavioral and physiological mechanisms in the body.\n\nPositive thinking can better behavior by leading people to engage in healthier lifestyles such as exercise. A person's positivity can also improve their psychology, making them better at coping with stress -- a contributor to memory loss and brain shrinkage\n\nAccording to one of Levy's studies , in Ireland over the span of 30 years, mental conditions such as depression and anxiety were more common among people with negative ideas about aging.\n\nDr. Luigi Ferrucci, geriatrician and director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging , was skeptical at first when the idea of a link between someone's health and their feelings about age was suggested.\n\nThe Baltimore team's study, which started in 1958, also asked participants about their thoughts on aging, and expecting to find no connection between the two. But they soon discovered that people with a positive attitude toward aging had less cardiovascular disease, they produced less cortisol -- a stress hormone -- over time, and autopsy findings showed less frequent dementia.\n\n\"Using very, very objective measures, we found that they were much better compared to those that had a negative attitude,\" Ferrucci said.\n\nBut he cautioned that, \"while the evidence is really strong, whether we can we generalize this [finding] to the general population is not completely understood.\"\n\nWhere are people most negative?\n\n\"High income countries are the highly industrialized countries and industrialization tends to devalue older people,\" explained Erdman Palmore, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, in an email, adding that traditional rural societies tend to have higher respect because older people can keep working longer and are more valuable to the economy.\n\nRetirement policies make older people seem less valuable to society and a country's economy, he said.\n\nJapan, South Korea and Argentina are the three lowest-ranking countries when it comes to respect for the elderly, according to World Values Survey carried out between 2010 and 2014, despite their large elderly populations. These respect estimates -- recorded in 2014 -- paint a changing picture of perceptions.\n\nIn Japan , for example, middle-age men, who were traditionally valued, are now seen as having lost their honor and value in society.\n\nThe UK report found that most beliefs around age are formed by the age of 6. \"Once prejudice has been learned it is often very hard to unlearn,\" the report's lead author, Toby Green, wrote in an email.\n\n\"For many people the stereotypes they absorb then persist into later life -- at which point they begin to apply them to themselves. This means that negative age stereotypes are embedded among groups of all ages,\" he said.\n\nElderly people walk in the street at Kouganji Temple in Tokyo.\n\nWhere did the stereotypes come from?\n\nRewinding the clock 200 years, researchers found a shift in attitudes toward the elderly in 1880.\n\nIn one study , they analyzed synonyms for the word 'elderly' in a database of 400 million words included in a range or print sources from the past two centuries and found that from 1810 to 1879, the concept of getting older was viewed positively in the United States.\n\nThen, from 1880 onward -- the midst of industrialization -- people started seeing aging as something bad. The researchers suggest the rising number of people over the age of 65 was associated with the increase in negative beliefs around age.\n\nStill, there remain many countries where the elderly are viewed as a valuable part of the population and deserving of respect.\n\nGeorgia, Uzbekistan and Qatar scored top places in the world value survey when asked about whether people aged over 70 are likely to be seen with respect.\n\nPositive mindsets about age have very real impacts on the elderly.\n\n2018 study found that the chances of dementia can be lowered by 49.8% if a positive outlook is maintained. Older people with happy thoughts have also been proven to recover faster from cardiovascular events, according to Levy's work.\n\nThe need for integration\n\nIn 2016, WHO acknowledged the need for ageism to be globally addressed and highlighted that ageism is most likely more widespread than sexism and racism.\n\nGreen believes that one of the solutions to reducing ageism is integrating generations.\n\nHis report for the Royal Society of Public health found that 64% of Brits didn't have a friend who is at least 30 years older than they are.\n\nIntegration is \"really important -- there's so much evidence on the health and wellbeing benefits of this,\" he said.\n\nStarting with young children and encouraging workplace diversity to tackle ageism are other strategies Green recommends. \"Making this progress in workplace settings would do a great deal of good for wider cultural change.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFerrucci believes that \"we need to see our life as a trajectory. Every single period is important.\"\n\nPeople should prepare for aging and make changes to their lives now to expand the years spent in good health, he said. Physical exercise and nutrition were the most important factors in longevity.\n\n\"Our aging population is the strongest, most important change that will occur in the world over the next 20 years,\" he added. \"When aging comes, it's not so bad if you have been planning for it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "New York City birth certificates get gender-neutral option", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/o-EulmGcJH4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A new law in New York City makes it easier for transgender and non-binary New Yorkers to match their birth certificate to their gender identity without needing a signed affidavit from a healthcare provider.\n\nThe law, which went into effect Tuesday, also creates a new label, \"X,\" to reflect a non-binary identity.\n\n\"Transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers deserve the right to choose how they identify and to live with respect and dignity,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement released Monday.\n\n\"Our city respects your gender identity and the right to have it affirmed on your birth certificate,\" de Blasio's office echoed in a Tuesday tweet.\n\nUnder the law, individuals born in New York City can apply to have the gender marker on their birth certificate changed by submitting a notarized application stating that the revision is to reflect their \"true gender identity and is not for any fraudulent purpose.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Controversial tool emerges in opioid fight: fentanyl test strips", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/QKelTf2g84g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A controversial tool has emerged in the fight against opioid overdose deaths. It's a strip that allows people who use street drugs such as cocaine and heroin to test whether their drugs are laced with fentanyl.\n\nIf the drugs test positive, they might choose not to use them or choose to use less of them.\n\nAccording to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , fentanyl is now the deadliest drug in America and was linked to nearly 29% of all overdose deaths in 2016. The synthetic opioid is about 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and produces a powerful high. It's cheap and sometimes mixed into street drugs without the buyer even knowing. Given its potency, it can be deadly.\n\nFentanyl test strip technology was originally developed by a Canadian biotech company BTNX to test urine samples for the presence of the drug, but the strips work basically the same way when they're dipped in the residue of cooked heroin or when a little water is added to empty baggies of cocaine.\n\nIt works like a pregnancy test in reverse. One line on the strip suggests that the drugs are positive for fentanyl. Two lines is interpreted as a negative result.\n\nIn a study , researchers at Johns Hopkins and Brown University determined that the test strips worked to detect even low concentrations of fentanyl in street drugs.\n\n\"Our findings bring to the table evidence that can inform a public health approach to the fentanyl crisis. Smart strategies that reduce harm can save lives,\" Susan Sherman, a co-author on the study, said in a news release\n\nAccording to the study, several programs in the United States that distribute clean syringes to people who use drugs have started to distribute fentanyl test strips, as well.\n\nIn Los Angeles County , emergency departments, first responders and other heath care workers have been advised to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the strips with patients who use street drugs.\n\nThe test strips aren't 100% effective at eliminating the risk of overdose, since they don't identify all forms of fentanyl and can produce false negatives. They also don't let users know how much fentanyl the drugs contain.\n\nStill, the researchers see an opportunity to halt the increase in fentanyl-related overdose deaths.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in the overdose epidemic, and we need to embrace the full range of interventions that can save lives,\" Sherman said.\n\nIn a video , the Urban Survivor's Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of drug users, offers instructions on how to use the strips and what to do if the results are positive.\n\n\"Let's say you had some drugs you were going to inject. ...

Among them is a concern that even if people who use drugs know that their drugs are laced with fentanyl, they will still use the drugs, despite the apparent danger. They might also use the strips to seek out drugs that contain fentanyl to achieve a stronger high.\n\n\"We can't afford to create a false sense of security. ...

In severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated.\n\nYemen has experienced two waves of cholera cases since the war began, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nThe first wave occurred between October 2016 and 26 April 2017, during which 25,800 suspected cases and 129 associated deaths were reported\n\nThe second wave began on 27 April 2017 and has since resulted in 1.336 million cases and 2,641 deaths as of November\n\nTo understand the nature of the strain of bacteria behind the epidemic, the researchers sequenced the genomes of 42 cholera samples collected in Yemen itself and from a Yemeni refugee centre on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border, along with 74 other cholera samples from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThey were compared to a global collection of more than 1,000 cholera samples from the current and ongoing pandemic, known as the seventh cholera pandemic, which began in the 1960s and is caused by a single lineage of Vibrio cholera.\n\nThe researchers found that the cholera strain causing the Yemen epidemic was related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia that had spread globally, but also that the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia or the Middle East.\n\nThis particular cholera strain was circulating and causing outbreaks in Eastern Africa between 2013 and 2014, prior to appearing in Yemen in 2016.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How weather forecasts are used to prevent cholera outbreaks\n\nThe findings contradicted previous theories that the two waves of cholera in Yemen were caused by two different strains.\n\n\"Knowing how cholera moves globally gives us the opportunity to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity.\n\nThe science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin, allowing them to identify variations in its composition.\n\nA third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon.\n\nWhat else might we learn from this mission?\n\nChang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nScientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China\n\nThe lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere.\n\nThe arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say.\n\nOther equipment/experiments include:\n\nA panoramic camera\n\nA radar to probe beneath the lunar surface\n\nAn imaging spectrometer to identify minerals\n\nAn experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nIs there a 'dark side of the Moon'?\n\nThe lunar far side is often referred to as the \"dark side\", though \"dark\" in this case means \"unseen\" rather than \"lacking light\". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime.\n\nBut because of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThe far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the \"maria\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nHow will scientists keep track of the rover?\n\nIn an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: \"The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.\"\n\nSo the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao - or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May.\n\nQueqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.\n\nWhat are China's plans in space?\n\nChina wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia.\n\nIn 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIt will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022.\n\nThe chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as \"an important milestone\" for the country's space effort, state media report.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station\n\nThe BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success.\n\nBut Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa.\n\n\"The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,\" he told the BBC.\n\nYe Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open.\n\n\"They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,\" he said.\n\nChina has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US.\n\nThe far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as \"a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Genetically modified 'shortcut' boosts plant growth by 40%", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46750092", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Brian Stauffer Image caption These genetically modified tobacco plants were found to be 40% more productive\n\nScientists in the US have engineered tobacco plants that can grow up to 40% larger than normal in field trials.\n\nThe researchers say they have found a way of overcoming natural restrictions in the process of photosynthesis that limit crop productivity.\n\nThey believe the method could be used to significantly boost yields from important crops including rice and wheat.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Science.\n\nResearchers are growing increasingly concerned about the ability of the world to feed a growing population in a time of serious climate change.\n\nIt's expected that agricultural demand will increase globally by 60-120% by the middle of this century compared to 2005. Increases in crop yields however are rising by less that 2% per annum, so there's likely to be a significant shortfall by 2050.\n\nWhile the use of fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation have boosted yields over the past few decades, their potential for future growth is limited.\n\nInstead, scientists are increasingly looking to improving the process of photosynthesis as a way of increasing food productivity.\n\nImage copyright James Baltz/College of Agricultural Image caption Aerial view of the 2017 field trials. Researchers found that plants engineered with a synthetic shortcut are about 40% more productive.\n\nWhile plants use the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that fuel the plant's growth, the chemical steps involved produce some toxic compounds that actually limit the potential of the crop.\n\nThese toxins are then recycled by the plant in a process called photorespiration - but this costs the plant precious energy that could have been used to increase yield.\n\nIn this study, researchers set out to developed a way around the photosynthesis glitch.\n\n\"We've tried three different biochemical designs with the aim of shortcutting this very energy expensive process,\" said lead author Dr Paul South with the US Agricultural Research Service.\n\n\"It's been estimated that in plants like soybeans, rice and fruit and vegetables, it can be a significant drag on yield by as much as 36%.

The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.\n\nBut Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after.\n\nThe scientists have decided to call the larger lobe \"Ultima\", and the smaller lobe \"Thule\".

Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nProf Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau volcano: Satellites get clear view of collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46743362", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:09", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Planet Labs, Inc.

interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The fly-by marked the farthest close encounter of an object within our solar system.\n\nSince then, the probe has sent images revealing Ultima Thule to be a contact binary \u2014 two bodies that formed separately and then got stuck together. The formation, resembling a red-hued snowman \u2014 caused by irradiated ice \u2014 is just over 21 miles (34 km) long.\n\nScientists deduced that the conjoined bodies \u2014 one named Ultima and the other Thule \u2014 were once part of a cloud of smaller, rotating space rocks that eventually bound together into two larger bodies orbiting at a much slower speed.\n\nPluto and beyond\n\n\"We're looking for the objects that put the brakes on these objects,\" Showalter said. Finding the moons, which would orbit Ultima Thule up to 500 miles (800 km) from its surface, would also reveal details about the space rock's mass and density.\n\nThe spacecraft, now 3 million miles (5 million km) beyond Ultima Thule, will ping back more detailed images and data in the coming weeks, NASA said.\n\nSince its launch in 2006, New Horizons has traveled 4 billion miles (6.4 billion km) to the solar system\u2019s edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto, its five moons and hundreds of icy Kuiper Belt objects.\n\nScientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched, according to NASA, making the mission unique in that respect. In 2014, astronomers found the rocky formation using the Hubble Space Telescope and the following year selected it for New Horizon\u2019s extended mission.\n\nWhile the mission marks the farthest inspection of an object in our solar system, NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 and 2, a pair of\n\ndeep-space probes launched in 1977, have reached greater distances on a mission to survey extrasolar bodies.

The company said demand for iPhones is waning and revenue for the last quarter of 2018 will fall well below projections, a decrease traced mainly to China.\n\nApple's shares dropped 10 percent Thursday on the news \u2014 its worst loss since 2013. The company shed $74.6 billion in market value, amid a broader sell-off among technology companies, which suffered their worst loss in seven years.\n\nApple's news is a \"wake-up call for the industry,\" said analyst Dan Ives of research firm Wedbush Securities.\n\nAnd it's not just Apple. Demand has been lackluster across the board, Ives said. Samsung, long the leading seller of smartphones, has been hit even harder, as its phone shipments dropped 8 percent during the 12 months ending in September.\n\n\"The smartphone industry is going through significant headwinds,\" Ives said. \"Smartphone makers used to be like teenagers, and the industry was on fire. Now it feels like they're more like senior citizens in terms of maturity.\"\n\nVictim of its own success\n\nTech innovations in phones grew in leaps and bounds earlier in the 2010s, with dramatic improvements in screen size, screen resolution, battery life, cameras and processor speed every year.\n\nBut the industry is a victim of its own success. Innovation began to slow down around 2014, once Apple boosted the screen size with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models. While phones kept improving, new features tended to be incremental, such as a new flash technique to already excellent phone cameras. It's the stuff consumers won't typically notice \u2014 or want to shell out for.\n\n\"Since the iPhone 6 you've seen it has been tough to innovate to continue to raise the bar,\" Ives said.\n\nApple customers now upgrade every 33 months on average, longer than the 24 or 25 months three years ago, he said.\n\nApple's diminished growth projections, fueled by plummeting sales in China, have reinforced fears the world's second-largest economy is losing steam. Its $1,000 iPhone is a tough sell to Chinese consumers unnerved by an economic slump and the trade war with the U.S. They also have a slew of cheaper smartphones from homegrown competitors such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo to choose from.\n\nThe fact that even Apple's iPhone juggernaut is suffering cements a larger trend for all major smartphone makers. After a steady rise for a decade, worldwide smartphone shipments fell 3 percent to 1.42 billion in 2018, the first annual drop, according to International Data Corp., which tracks such movements. IDC estimates that shipments will rebound 3 percent in 2019 to 1.46 billion, but that still falls short of 2017 levels.\n\nNo 'silver bullet'\n\nIt doesn't help that top phones come with four-digit price tags \u2014 $1,100 for the iPhone XS Max and $1,000 for Samsung's Galaxy Note 9. The top-end Max model sells for $1,450 in the U.S.\n\n\"They're getting more and more expensive while offering fewer and fewer new, innovative features that I'll actually use,\" said Zachary Pardes, a tech-savvy 31-year-old in Fairfield, Connecticut. \"I'll upgrade when the battery stops working. When I'm forced to buy a new phone, I'll buy a new phone.\"\n\nVivian Yang, a manager at a Beijing technology company, also balked at the price. \"Nobody needs such a phone,\" she said.\n\nIDC analyst Ramon Llamas said the cycle might bottom out and start growing again in 2021 or 2022, when people's current phones start reaching the end of their useful life. \"People will still replace their phones. It's going to happen eventually,\" he said.\n\nBut there's no \"silver bullet\" that will spur growth to levels seen in the past when the industry was less mature.\n\nFoldable smartphones, with screens that unfold like a wallet to increase display size, are one thing that could spur excitement, but they're expensive and not due out until at least the end of the year.\n\nAnother thing that might spur growth: 5G, the next-generation that telecom companies are currently in the process of building, expected to be faster and more reliable than the current 4G network. The first 5G compatible phones are due out this year.\n\n\"There's more pressure on 5G as the next-wave smartphone,\" since sales are so lackluster, said Ives. \"There will be a battle royale for 5G phones.\"\n\nBut 5G will take years for broad, nationwide deployment, so the new 5G smartphones coming out this year are not likely to make much of a splash immediately either.\n\nAnalysts say smartphone makers need to push into under-saturated areas like Africa and elsewhere, and also sell more services like cloud storage, streaming music and phone software. But the glory days of untrammeled growth appear to be over.\n\n\"It's going to be a slow slog,\" Llamas said. \"By no means is this the end of the smartphone market. But this is an indication that the smartphone market can be a victim of its own success.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Snacks on Wheels: PepsiCo Tests Self-driving Robot Delivery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/snacks-on-wheels-pepsico-tests-self-driving-robot-delivery/4727515.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Forget vending machines, PepsiCo is testing a way to bring snacks directly to college students.\n\nThe chip and beverage maker says it will start making deliveries with self-driving robots on Thursday at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.

Our casting director recommended a Saudi comedian, who happened to be in LA for a couple months shooting a tv show. His name is Fahad Albutairi. \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI looked him up. He was the first Saudi stand-up comedian to appear on stage professionally in the Kingdom, the \u201cJerry Seinfeld of Saudi Arabia.\u201d He had a couple million Twitter followers. (He has none now; I\u2019ll get to that.) He was, frankly, more interesting than the part. \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThe day of the recording, I walked to the booth to meet Fahad and direct his session \u2013 it was just a couple lines; I\u2019d say hi, run it a few times, and we\u2019d both be on our way.\n\n\n\nFahad was standing with a woman, who he introduced as his wife, @LoujainHathloul. \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nLoujain didn\u2019t know anyone in LA, so she was tagging along with Fahad for the day. They were young, cool, cosmopolitan, and incredibly nice. I liked them right away. We chatted. \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nI asked Fahad about being a Saudi comedian \u2013 about doing something that didn\u2019t exist before in his country. I had recently had breakfast with Trevor Noah to talk about a project, and it seemed like he was coming from a similar place... \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\n...growing up without hearing other stand-ups and being unfamiliar with the standard rhythms. So Trevor had to create his own. Fahad was fascinated. Yes, he had had a similar experience. But his voice was also shaped by the fact that comedy in the Kingdom was...dangerous. \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nSo now we dipped into politics.\n\n\n\nI mentioned the young, \u201cprogressive\u201d Prince Mohammed bin Salman. All the press in the US seemed pretty positive about the guy. He was meeting people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Were they feeling optimistic about the future of Saudi Arabia? \u2014 Kirk Rudell (@krudell) January 2, 2019\n\nThey were hopeful but warned there was still a long way to go on human rights. Which is why they\u2019d moved to the UAE.\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh. At least you\u2019re safe,\u201d I said. With millions of fans, he was too high profile to mess with.

(AP) \u2014 A California parole panel on Thursday recommended for the first time that Charles Manson follower Robert Beausoleil be freed after serving nearly a half-century in prison for murder.\n\nBeausoleil, 71, was not involved in the most notorious killings of actress Sharon Tate and six others by the Manson \u201cfamily\u201d in 1969. He was convicted in the slaying of musician Gary Hinman that same year.\n\nHinman was tortured for three days, according to testimony at previous parole hearings, including when Manson cut his face with a sword.\n\nParole panels ruled against releasing Beausoleil 18 prior times.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s incoming governor, Gavin Newsom, could block the parole in coming months. Termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown has consistently stopped releases for followers of the cult leader, who died in prison in 2017.\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which has opposed such paroles, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Parole panels have ruled against releasing Beausoleil 18 prior times.\n\nGary Hinman\u2019s cousin, Kay Hinman Martley, who attended Thursday\u2019s hearing, said Beausoleil was already lucky once when his death sentence in 1970 was reduced to life in prison by an appeals court in 1973.\n\n\u201cI constantly have hope that they\u2019ll do the right thing and keep these people in prison, and now my hopes have to go with the governor,\u201d she said, adding she plans to reach out to Newsom to tell him \u201cthis man does not belong outside the walls of prison.\u201d\n\nBeausoleil\u2019s attorney, Jason Campbell, said his client is no longer dangerous and that his release \u201cis long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a very thoughtful, insightful and compassionate person.

Without public opinion weighing in on this, there is no hope.\u201d\n\nShe objected that Beausoleil keeps breaking prison rules by profiting from selling his art and music outside of prison.

But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing to block the bill and President Donald Trump saying he would veto it.\n\nThe partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with Democrats now controlling one chamber of Congress, there\u2019s no sign of any deal.\n\nDemocrats are more determined than ever not to give Trump a single dollar for his border wall, and Trump hasn\u2019t moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (There\u2019s an ongoing semantics battle over \u201cborder security,\u201d \u201csteel slats,\u201d \u201cfencing,\u201d and a \u201cwall\u201d that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. Sean Hannity, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but Democrats have also said they now wouldn\u2019t accept that deal, partly because they don\u2019t trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.\n\nA DACA deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if Democrats decided to trust Trump. Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are set to attend another White House meeting with Trump on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.\n\nGetty Editorial \u201cWe\u2019re not doing the wall,\u201d Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday night.\n\nOn Thursday, House Democrats passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for the Department of Homeland Security that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October.\n\nThe short-term bill for DHS passed the House 239-192, with five Republicans breaking ranks to join all Democrats in support of the bill.\n\nThe House also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yes.\n\nThe Republican defections \u2015 contrasted with Democratic unity \u2015 are the first signs of the GOP cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who\u2019s up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.\n\nBut aside from a few Republicans, the GOP is digging in. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) \u2015 a member who speaks with Trump on a regular basis \u2015 told HuffPost on Thursday that the shutdown wouldn\u2019t end until Democrats approved wall money. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s a wall between Tijuana and San Diego, right? If it\u2019s so bad or immoral as they say, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be willing to tear them down,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nJordan is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesn\u2019t include Trump\u2019s full request, but one of the byproducts of Democrats taking back the House is that Jordan\u2019s vote is irrelevant. As Democrats proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the Senate to act and the president to sign it \u2015 two things that remain unlikely.\n\nMcConnell once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the Senate unanimously two weeks ago a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d He says he won\u2019t allow a vote on anything \u201cthat does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation.\n\nLeaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesn\u2019t have a real chance of passing, the House and Senate could always override Trump\u2019s veto, but that would require a significant number of Republicans to break ranks \u2015 more than two dozen in the Senate and around 50 in the House.\n\nPolitically, that\u2019s a tall order for the GOP, a party that seems to value fealty to Trump above all else.\n\nBut the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week \u2015 looking more likely by the day \u2015 it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.\n\nFor Democrats, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. It\u2019s almost a representation of Trump\u2019s entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. Democrats don\u2019t want to give in to Trump on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that Democrats give him what he wants."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump\u2019s New \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Meme On His Border Wall Suggests He\u2019s Never Seen Show", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-game-of-thrones-meme_us_5c2ea35ce4b08aaf7a97b80c", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Donald Trump seems to love \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d memes, but it appears as if he\u2019s never actually watched the HBO series.\n\nTwitter users made that discovery Thursday after the president posted an image on Instagram of his face and the words \u201cThe wall is coming,\u201d a reference to \u201cGoT\u2019s\u201d \u201cWinter is coming\u201d tagline.\n\nThis came one day after the president brought a similar poster version of a \u201cSanctions are coming\u201d meme he posted two months ago into a Cabinet meeting.\n\nHowever, some of the show\u2019s fans noticed a slight problem with Trump\u2019s \u201cwall is coming\u201d post: The Great Wall of Westeros was destroyed during \u201cGoT\u2019s\u201d Season 7 finale.\ufeff\n\nThe Wall was destroyed at the end of the latest season of Game of Thrones. https://t.co/4skG02MPjV \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 3, 2019\n\nAnyone gonna explain to him that the premise for the show is that wallls in the end don\u2019t work? \u2014 FranckPG (@_FranckPG) January 3, 2019\n\nApparently the person that stole the idea has never actually watched GOT. #NoWallEver pic.twitter.com/CTgOhGuSYM \u2014 Get Off Your Ass and Vote\ud83c\udf0a\u2648\ufe0f\u269b\ufe0f (@haven1406) January 3, 2019\n\nOther people had problems with Trump\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d meme that weren\u2019t related to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nAlso, that\u2019s not a wall.

It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies.

The wives in the study who perceived themselves as having a cluttered home or a home that needed work tended to have increased levels of cortisol throughout the day.

Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/facebook-suicide-screening-algorithm.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-04 09:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "A police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.\n\nEarlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case. Facebook called to warn the Police Department about the suicide threat.\n\nThe officer who took the call quickly located the woman, but she denied having suicidal thoughts, the police report said. Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital \u2014 either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook\u2019s intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.)\n\nPolice stations from Massachusetts to Mumbai have received similar alerts from Facebook over the last 18 months as part of what is most likely the world\u2019s largest suicide threat screening and alert program. The social network ramped up the effort after several people live-streamed their suicides on Facebook Live in early 2017. It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union \u2014 as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site. Even as Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has apologized for improper harvesting of user data, the company grappled last month with fresh revelations about special data-sharing deals with tech companies."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Phys Ed: Stand More, Lounge Less?

For those of us who overindulged and slacked off on our exercise regimens over the holidays, it also means that being upright is unlikely to help us lose weight.\n\nBut it does not mean we should take this news lying or sitting down, the study\u2019s authors caution, because frequent standing is likely to have other, substantial health impacts.\n\nBy now, almost everyone has heard about, dabbled with or rolled their eyes at the phenomenon of standing desks. Many of us also wear fitness trackers that nag us every hour or so to get up and move."}]
