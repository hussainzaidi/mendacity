But it also meant promises delivered for voters who prescribed his electric shock therapy and who relish the sight of political, legal and media establishments in Trump-induced meltdowns.\n\nAfter a year of domestic chaos, shocks from the Russia probe and belligerence abroad, Trump is less restrained and making more waves than ever.\n\n\"My whole life has been heat. I like heat, in a certain way,\" Trump said in January, summing up the sensory overload of his presidency\n\nThere is a sense that a presidency based on the volcanic temperament of a commander in chief who adores risk and disdains history, briefings and fact is careening out of control, setting up an even more chaotic 2019.\n\nConcern, even among so far docile Washington Republicans, about Trump's course is palpable.\n\nDuring a discombobulating holiday season, a constitutional or international crisis felt just around the corner. In an administration steeped in scandal, the stench of corruption thickens by the day.\n\nThe President is calling the shots and trusting his gut.\n\nHe's replaced calming forces -- such as ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and chief of staff John Kelly -- with more pliable loyalists less likely to challenge him, Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, respectively.\n\nThe result is a presidency increasingly testing limits on executive power and liberated by the commander in chief's prerogative to decree foreign policy.\n\nAfter nine months back in the real world Tillerson offered a chilling glimpse into how Trump operates.\n\n\"I'd have to say to him, 'Well, Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,' \" Tillerson recounted\n\nTrump's startling decision to pull troops out of Syria was a case study of a President who defies advisers, and the consequences be damned. A senior administration official told CNN's Jim Sciutto that national security decisions are \"made on a whim on phone calls.\"\n\nRelentless Mueller\n\nBut Trump does not control everything. In fact, he may not control his own fate.\n\nThe relentless march of special counsel Robert Mueller is bolstering the possibility that Trump won the presidency by colluding with a hostile foreign power and tried to enrich himself in the process.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and Mueller has yet to prove that the campaign colluded with Russia or the President obstructed justice to cover it up.\n\nThere is, however, a darkening cloud over the President . An impeachment saga is becoming more likely in 2019, depending on Mueller's final report.\n\nJUST WATCHED Key players in the Mueller Russia investigation Replay More Videos ...

They were also validation for his voters, who see his populist crusade as the scourge of international elites.\n\nBut for anyone who believes that the values and international infrastructure that Trump is undermining underpinned decades of relative peace, won the Cold War and made the world safe for capitalism, these are worrying times.\n\nTrump also escalated his war on fact and truth in 2018, inventing new narratives when reality doesn't suit him, compromising trust in critical political and legal institutions.\n\nIn recent days, for instance, the President has falsely claimed that the US eradicated ISIS in Syria. Greeting troops in Iraq, he lied when he said he had given them their first pay raise for 10 years and that it was 10%.\n\nThere is a method to Trump's assault on institutions and facts. His war is against forces and realities that contradict him or challenge his power.\n\nWhat a year\n\nLiving in the same decade as Trump is exhausting.\n\nA daily parade of scandals, head-spinning reversals and feuding numbs the soul and drains the outrage from shocking events.\n\nThe year started with the President boasting that he had a bigger nuclear button than North Korea's Kim Jong Un and strafing the \"deep state\" Justice Department.\n\nMonths later he held a hitherto unthinkable summit with Kim in Singapore and told a campaign crowd that he and the ruthless North Korean dictator \"fell in love.\"\n\nTrump presided over the separations of hundreds of kids from their undocumented migrant parents and secured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhen Sen.

Unemployment is below 4% and consumer confidence is high, though it dipped a little in December.\n\nSince he'll get the blame for any slowdown that could imperil his re-election, Trump gets to crow for now.\n\nHe also claims a huge victory in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Yet, like many of his negotiated triumphs, it looks less significant on close inspection.\n\nTrump justifiably argues that North Korea has stopped testing missiles and nuclear devices since he met Kim. But there is no sign of permanent denuclearization. His moving of the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem honored a campaign promise but may have set back peace hopes.\n\nIn October, Trump got the right to count his presidency as historically consequential when Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice after denying claims that he had sexually assaulted a young woman while in high school.\n\nJUST WATCHED How Mueller is closing in on Trump Replay More Videos ...

There's been a hike in military spending. The White House also engineered bipartisan victories, on combating opioid abuse and overhauling criminal justice.\n\nBut the incoming Democratic-led House and its oversight of every aspect of Trump's life and presidency and the stirring 2020 election mean bipartisanship is unlikely in 2019.\n\nBut with Mueller closing in, and the President moving to maximize his own personal power, the year gone by does seem to be setting the stage for something even bigger.\n\nIf so, 2018 will have just been a warm-up act."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Congress adjourns with no end to shutdown in sight", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-cVHtXv9Ei8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The House and Senate adjourned Thursday after brief pro forma sessions and made plans to reconvene Monday, essentially punting any action to end the partial government shutdown until next week as negotiators remain far from an agreement.\n\nThe halls of Congress were ghost town-esque on Thursday, with the two chambers meeting for only a few minutes each.

And people even closer to Trump, such as his son Don Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner, cannot be sure they are in the clear although all, including the President, profess innocence and downplay Mueller's investigation.\n\nYet Mueller's success in securing plea deals from the likes of Flynn, Gates and Cohen is adding to the President's apparent legal peril.\n\nIn one of the more surreal twists of the Trump presidency, there is a conversation going in Washington about how Trump might have to win re-election to outrun a statute of limitations on campaign finance allegations.\n\nThis trail of dishonesty and deceit is evident even before Mueller has delivered what could ultimately be his most explosive findings -- whether he has found evidence that the President's campaign cooperated with Russia and whether he obstructed justice in the firing of former FBI chief James Comey and a bid to thwart Mueller.\n\nA scandal-ridden presidency\n\nA full assessment of the depth of Trump's political and legal predicament may only become clear next year. But the President has already expressed concern , according to CNN reporting, that he could be impeached.\n\nBut even if all the investigations stopped now and he was cleared of all wrongdoing, Trump would still be remembered for presiding over one of the most scandal-ridden presidencies of modern history.\n\nTrump and his supporters maintain that there is no smoking gun and that the President's problems all stem from rogue prosecutors from the \"deep state\" that has always hated Trump. The President's cheerleaders on conservative channels meanwhile take up his cry that the democratic will of voters is at risk of being besmirched by a \"fake news\" media that is hostile towards him.\n\n\"Nobody but for me would be looked at like this. Nobody,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview this week, referring to claims he told Cohen to pay off women who claimed affairs with him to avoid hurting his campaign.\n\nTrump's counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted to CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday that Trump's presumed foes in the media were willfully ignoring his arguments that he did not break the law.\n\n\"It's important and credible to the rest of the country, except for the people so blinded by their hatred toward him or their wishful thinking that he won't be President if they just close their eyes and click their heels three times,\" she said. \"Get over it.\"\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani is offering the defense that Cohen should not be believed because he is a convicted liar.\n\nYet, the growing pile of evidence from Mueller and other prosecutors is rendering the denials of culpability from Trump and his supporters less credible.\n\nAs more damaging details emerge, Trump is indulging in his habitual practice of abandoning a position that has become untenable and constructing a new reality that better suits him.\n\n\"As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!\" Trump tweeted on Thursday.\n\nBut the narrative that Cohen is a liar so Trump is in the clear ignores crucial details of Mueller's filings.\n\nCorroboration\n\nJUST WATCHED Cuomo to Conway: I'll call you a liar Replay More Videos ...

The President's fixer also said as much on Friday.\n\n\"There is a substantial amount of information that they possessed that corroborates the fact that I am telling the truth,\" Cohen said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nTrump's repeated mantra of \"no collusion\" with the Russians is also looking increasingly threadbare. There were multiple contacts between Trump's associates and Russians during the campaign and transition -- at least 16 according to CNN's r eporting.\n\nAnd many of those associates have since lied about the interactions, giving the impression that they are trying to cover something up.\n\nThe President's claims that he had nothing to do with Russia have been undermined by revelations in the Cohen case that he was pursuing a potentially lucrative deal to build a luxury tower in Moscow until deep into a campaign that was simultaneously the target of a meddling effort by the Kremlin's spies.\n\nAnd Mueller is clearly probing whether there is a nexus between Trump's business ventures and Russia's election interference.\n\nIn a sentencing memo earlier this month, he wrote that the Trump Tower project \"occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nIt is, of course, possible that all of these Trump associates were operating outside the knowledge of the President. Statements in documents filed by Mueller and other jurisdictions are prosecutorial in nature and may not reveal mitigating circumstances that Trump could use in his defense\n\nIt is unclear at this point whether the US attorney's office in the Southern District of New York would be able to prove that Trump knowingly asked Cohen to break campaign finance laws.\n\nBut the idea that Trump knew nothing -- about Russia attempts to infiltrate his campaign, about hush payments or other key aspects of cases in which is involved -- appears unlikely, given his omnipotent role in his inner circle.\n\nAnd he has already proven to have lied, if Mueller is to be believed, about key aspects of the Russia investigation and his interaction with Cohen.\n\nStill, many legal experts believe that if wrongdoing is found, the President is immune from prosecution owing to his unique constitutional position.\n\nIf his only transgression does turn out to be on campaign finance, it seems unlikely that Democrats in the House will risk an impeachment process based on charges that may fall short of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nSo far, Trump's firewall of Republican support in the Senate, where any subsequent impeachment trial would take place is standing firm.\n\nWhether that would start crumbling should Mueller produce a damning report that causes a fracturing of Trump's political power base as an election approaches in 2020 remains untested.\n\nWhile much has been learned about the President's legal exposure in recent days, the true extent of his liability remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, however, it's clear: the President's legal and political position is far more perilous than it was weeks ago and he has reason to be worried about a flurry of investigations that are digging deep into his private, personal, business and political life."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "CNN debunks Giuliani's Mueller claim", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hGq_PUPdQIs/rudy-giuliani-mueller-strzok-page-texts-perez-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Eventually, they gave up.\n\n\"When people are in their 20s and 30s, they can't really afford to live in a bigger space in a city,\" Katsunori said. \"We knew that if we wanted to have more kids, we couldn't do it there.\"\n\nCocooned amid hills, the little town of Nagi-cho is also home to a Japan Self Defense Forces garrison and the Nagi Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nFourteen years later, the Osakas moved to Nagi, where Katsunori grew up. The sleepy agricultural town in western Japan has become a success story in the country's efforts to boost its declining birth rate.\n\nWith a population of about 6,000, Nagi feels a world away from Nagoya, and residents cite the lack of busy streets and crowds as reasons why it is a great place to bring up children.\n\nBut they're not the only benefits: Nagi also pays couples who live there to have children.\n\nFamilies receive 100,000 yen ($879) for their first child, 150,000 yen ($1,335) for their second and as much as 400,000 yen ($3,518) for the fifth child born to the same family.\n\nNagi has been ramping up payments since 2004, as well as offering other fertility-boosting parental perks, to turbocharge the town's birth rate and buck Japan's broader trend of aging populations.\n\nPerks include subsidized housing, free vaccinations, school allowances and reduced nursery costs.\n\nAnd they appear to be working.\n\nIn the neighborhood where the Osakas live, most couples have three or more children because they can and they want to.\n\nThis leaves Nagi in stark contrast to much of Japan.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the town's fertility rate -- based on the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- doubled from 1.4 to 2.8, to widespread domestic acclaim.\n\nSince then, Nagi's total fertility rate has dipped slightly to 2.39 but is still considerably higher than the national average of 1.46.\n\nThe Osakas say they'd like their children to experience the world first, instead of settling down immediately in Nagi-cho.\n\nShrinking Japan\n\nJapan has been on a steady demographic decline since the 1970s.\n\n1.3 million, In 2017, fewer than 950,000 babies were born while the number of deaths rose to a postwar high of1.3 million, according to the Ministry of Health and Labor.\n\nand children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. Japan's population is expected to drop to about The country's total population stands at 127 million,and children make up just 12.3% of the total, compared with 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China and 30.8% for India, according to government figures. And by 2065 Japan's population is expected to drop to about 88 million\n\nMore than 5,400 children are seeking an elusive spot at day care centers in the city, nearly 30% of the national total.\n\nTraditionally, government policies had made it difficult for working men and women to balance their careers with family life, said Hirokazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nAs well as a lack of child care, the country's declining fertility rate is influenced by career demands and the increasing trend among men and women to delay or avoid marriage . The numbers of people still unmarried by age 50 hit a record 23.37% for men and 14.06% for women in 2015, according to a report released by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.\n\nBut Kato said another key factor is the steady migration of people from the countryside to expensive smaller apartments in crowded cities.\n\nMore than 93% of Japan's population lives in urban areas , where having one or more children is just too hard for many couples.\n\n\"There's a huge gap between the cost of living in Japan's major cities and the less populated areas of the country,\" Kato added. Couples in the city are often also far from their families, who could otherwise help support them.\n\nIt's not uncommon for families to have three to five children in Nagi. Kids play games with their siblings at the local preschool. For now, there is no waiting list to get a spot at day care.\n\nIs the progress enough?\n\nSince the 1990s, Japan has introduced policies to boost its birth rate, such as enhancing child care services and improving housing and public facilities for families with children.\n\nLast year resulted in some progress nationally: The number of children on waiting lists for day care centers nationwide slipped below 20,000 for the first time in 10 years, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nspending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at day care centers. Furthermore, that year, the government announced a 2 trillion yen ($18 billion)spending package to expand free preschool for children ages 3 to 5 -- and for children 2 and under from low-income families -- and cut waiting times at day care centers.\n\nAs in many places around the world, women in Japan were traditionally expected to leave work to care for their families. But such attitudes are slowly shifting.\n\n\"The traditional way of thinking, 'men at work and women at home', is a historical relic in Japan,\" said Yukiko Inoue-Smith, a professor of education psychology at the University of Guam. \"Women in Japan want to keep their jobs, and their husbands want them to work so they can have a double income.\"\n\nGovernment efforts to keep women in the workforce through a plan called womenomics are also paying off.\n\nIn just three decades, the percentage of Japanese women age 30 to 34 who return to the labor force after becoming mothers has risen from 50% to 75%, according to recent reports.\n\nBut many of those who go back to work have to accept lower wages or get stuck on the career ladder, according to a report published in 2017 by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nFathers must also play a greater role in child care and the home so women can resume their careers, according to Inoue-Smith.\n\nThis presents its own difficulties. In Japan, new fathers can take up to one year of non-paid paternity leave -- one of the highest fathers leave periods in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, only 3% take this, as they fear the repercussions on their careers and income.\n\nA family-friendly future\n\nNestled amid leafy hills, Nagi is famous for its wagyu beef and boasts a small manufacturing center where 19 companies have factories. Life remains fairly traditional; most couples marry in their early to mid-20s and start families soon after.\n\nThe women who live in or move to the town know it doesn't offer high-flying careers but value the chance to balance work and home life.\n\nUp to 70% of women continue their day jobs, often as office workers or teachers, after childbirth. Lengthy commutes, grueling workloads and limited child care aren't a problem here. And for mothers who want to work a few hours a week, a local company offers casual jobs such as data inputting and packaging goods while their children are in day care.\n\nNobue Sasaki stands in the hallway of the Nagi Child Home.\n\nThe town also spends a decent proportion of its budget on family services, partly due to extra funds it receives from the government for hosting a Japan Self-Defense Force garrison.\n\nIn the past, officials here have also accepted lower salaries so they can funnel more money into the town's future.\n\nSome large extended families still live under one roof, or at least within the same neighborhood, so grandparents can pitch in with the children while their parents work.\n\nNagi-cho strives to create a family-friendly setting for all age groups. Kozue Kobayashi relaxes with her child in the Nagi Child Home. An older volunteer watches over a busy mother's child.\n\n\"We've really focused on creating a family-friendly environment in Nagi,\" Nobue Sasaki, a soft-spoken town official, said inside the pastel-tinted walls of the Nagi Child Home, a center dedicated to supporting mothers and people across the age spectrum.\n\nKozue Kobayashi, a mother in her early 30s who moved from Okayama city to Nagi, said she appreciated the camaraderie of the Nagi Child Home, where she gets help looking after her children. She comes most days.\n\n\"It's better than just staying at home and feeling alone and overwhelmed,\" Kobayashi said. \"If I'd stayed in Okayama, I wouldn't have access to this kind of service.\"\n\nNagi undertook a large-scale public relations campaign in 2012 to publicize the success of its family planning initiatives -- and word has spread.\n\nWhen CNN visited, a group of smartly dressed senior bureaucrats milled around the entrance to the center's playroom. They were just some of the many people who had come to learn the town's fertility secrets.\n\n\"Our population has remained stable, but we can take some lessons away from a space like this,\" said Nagatoshi Ishiura, a bespectacled local politician from the neighboring town of Shouji. \"It's nice to see a place where there's still exchange between three different generations.\"\n\nThe Osakas' daughter prepares to play against her brother. The Osakas don't necessarily want their kids to stay in Nagi after they've grown up.\n\nAs well as parent-friendly policies, changing attitudes in Japanese society have helped create the right environment for having children in Nagi. Traditional expectations that women give up work after childbirth are breaking down. Choosing to be a stay-at-home mom is gradually becoming a personal choice rather than a societal obligation, said Inoue-Smith, the education psychology professor.\n\nKaori chose parenthood over her career but said she wouldn't necessarily want that for her own children.\n\n\"I'm not expecting my own daughters to stay in Nagi,\" she said. \"I'd prefer it if they left Nagi and saw more of the world.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "He's the first person to cross Antarctica solo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/_zIjEtKJHME/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) American endurance athlete Colin O'Brady became the first person to cross Antarctica solo without help after 54 days traversing the barren, frigid continent, he said in an Instagram post.\n\nO'Brady revealed Wednesday that he covered the final 80 miles in one continuous push to the finish line that lasted more than 32 hours.\n\n\"FINISH LINE!!!

Brent crude, the global benchmark, slumped this week to its lowest level since August 2017.\n\nOil is an important bellwether of future economic growth, and wild price swings in recent days mirror those of global stocks.\n\nSustained downward pressure on oil prices reflects concerns about surging US production and a weaker global economy. Not even output cuts by OPEC and its partner states have been able to reverse the trend.\n\nThe dynamic could make for a wild 2019.\n\nGlobal slowdown\n\nInternational Monetary Fund economists expect global growth to slow to 2.5% next year from 2.9% in 2018. Reduced economic activity means less demand for energy products.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has warned of \"relatively weak\" demand in Europe and developed Asian countries. It also flagged a \"slowdown\" in demand in India, Brazil and Argentina caused in part by weak currencies.\n\nOPEC warned this month that demand for its oil next year would be about 1 million barrels a day less than in 2018.\n\n\"The dominant factor on the demand side will be the economic outlook,\" said Robin Mills, CEO of energy consulting firm Qamar Energy. \"It will receive some support from lower oil prices but overall the global economy appears likely to slow.\"\n\nOPEC and Russia\n\nOPEC and its allies agreed earlier in December to remove 1.2 million barrels a day from world markets.\n\nMembers of the cartel pledged to reduce their production by 800,000 barrels per day for six months beginning in January. Russia and other partners promised to slash an additional 400,000 barrels per day.\n\nReaching a deal caused prices to shoot higher, but the effect wore off within days.\n\nThe price of oil could determine what happens when the agreement expires in June.\n\n\"If it remains below $60 a barrel you would expect OPEC to look to extend the December agreement,\" said Russ Mould of online investment platform AJ Bell. \"If it has surged back toward say $80 a barrel it may then look to increase output once more.\"\n\nIran waivers\n\nThe United States surprised investors in November when it granted eight countries temporary sanctions waivers that allow them to buy from Iran without fear of punishment.\n\nThe waivers expire in May, and it's unclear whether they'll be extended.\n\nWhat happens next is \"very difficult to predict, because the United States just did an almost complete about-turn on Iran policy,\" said Spencer Welch, oil markets executive director at IHS Markit.\n\n\"The United States does not want the gasoline price to go to high, so it is likely that US policy will be influenced by what the market is doing, which will be influenced by how effective the OPEC cut is,\" he added.\n\nUS oil boom\n\nThe United States became the world's largest producer of crude oil in September, overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia for the first time since 1973.\n\nThe feat demonstrates how the US shale oil boom has reshaped the global energy landscape. American oil output has more than doubled over the past decade.\n\nIt has even raised questions about OPEC's ability to influence prices.\n\n\"One of the drivers behind the change in dynamics that has resulted in OPEC losing influence over the oil industry is the emergence of the capability of outsiders to produce oil,\" said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM.\n\n\"None have been more prominent in this arena in recent years than the United States,\" Ahmad said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Explosion lights up New York sky in shades of blue", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/4oiRy8C4dyc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) A transformer explosion at a power plant in Queens temporarily lit up the New York City skyline in a brilliant blue Thursday night.\n\nBut despite the eerily glowing color, an alien invasion it was not.\n\nInstead, the light came as part of a brief electrical fire after a \"couple of transformers tripped offline\" at the intersection of 20th Avenue and 32nd Street in Astoria, Con Edison spokesman Bob McGee told CNN.\n\nThe issue caused a transmission dip in the area, and Con Edison crews responded with the Fire Department of New York, Con Edison said.\n\nThe New York City sky lit up in an eerie shade of blue Thursday night, as seen from Columbus Circle in Manhattan.\n\nThe incident is under control and no injuries have been reported, the FDNY said.

I ate lunch, dropped off my dry cleaning, then stopped by my local Target to pick up some prescriptions.\n\nBut on the way to the counter I noticed a man in a black coat, wearing a backpack bearing a sign: \"In need of a kidney for my wife, B+. 917-442-6202.\"\n\nUnsure what to say, I quickly snapped a photo. And then he was gone. Although I generally hate posting pictures of people online without getting their approval, I decided to share the image on Twitter since his face wasn't in it -- and because the message was so important.\n\nHere is a photo I took at my Target yesterday and can't stop thinking about. pic.twitter.com/gbzF47AqCy\n\nWithin a few hours, my picture of this man -- whom I've since identified as Raymond Thompson -- had gone viral. Celebrities such as Zach Braff, Martina Navratilova and Evan Rachel Wood shared it. Actress Sarah Hyland, who recently revealed she had a second kidney transplant , shared the image, too.\n\nNearly a week later, the photo was past 23,000 retweets and 35,000 likes.\n\nThompson, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife Mylen and their 4-year old daughter, Rachel, doesn't even have a Twitter account. But he knew something was going on when his phone began lighting up with calls and texts from unfamiliar numbers all over the world. Strangers were offering to give Mylen a kidney.\n\nWhen I called Raymond, he recognized my name because others had sent him screenshots of my tweet.\n\nMylen met her future husband in an AOL chat room in 2000 and they bonded over their love of pro wrestling. She was diagnosed with kidney disease two years ago.\n\n\"She called me at work and said, 'Babe, you need to come home right now.' She said, 'I can't feel my right side. It's numb,' \" Raymond told me. Now \"she goes to a [dialysis] center for three hours, three days a week. There's a machine that filters your blood. It takes a lot out of you.\"\n\nMylen and Raymond's family members got tested, but none were a match. Raymond was inspired by the story of Rob Leibowitz, who wore an \"In need of kidney\" T-shirt around Disney World -- a gambit that eventually worked\n\nOne thing Raymond wants to clear up is that his family won't be setting up a GoFundMe for medical expenses -- between his work's insurance and Medicaid, they're covered. It's just the kidney they need.\n\n\"I had a few people walk up to me and try to give me money,\" he said. \"I refuse that every single time.\"\n\nThe Thompsons recently decided to switch Mylen's care to NYU Langone Hospital , a move that could open the door to test the many people who have called -- some from as far away as Pakistan and Australia -- to see if they're a match.\n\nOne of those people was Becca Joyner, who saw the tweet when it was shared by actress Patti Murin, who plays Anna in Broadway's \"Frozen.\"\n\nJoyner, a county clerk who lives in Farmville, North Carolina, suffers from Crohn's disease and recently underwent surgery to remove part of her intestine.\n\n\n\n\"I have been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count on my hand,\" she said. \"I was terrified. Afterward I spent a week in the hospital, so I know what it's like. Something was just telling me to reach out and see if you can help in any way.\"\n\nRaymond plans to contact those who've reached out starting in January. But even if a viral Twitter picture results in Mylen getting a kidney and moving off of dialysis, the Thompsons don't believe their work will be done.\n\n\"Sickness doesn't care who you are,\" said Raymond. \"I appreciate everyone who reaches out. It means a lot to us to get the message out there.\n\n\"Sign up to be organ donors. There are so many people that actually need organs, especially kidneys. You have two and can live a healthy life with just one. Just sign up.\"\n\nIndeed, the wait can be long for those in need of a kidney transplant. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOne person Raymond's message affected was me. Since our initial almost-encounter at Target, I've signed up to be a bone marrow donor and made an appointment to give blood.\n\nAnd, since we both shop at the same Target, it's not surprising to learn that we're also neighbors.

He didn't know he was about to accidentally help uncover a highly sensitive, secret presidential trip to a conflict zone.\n\nAbout six hours before Meloy's discovery, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were quietly whisked out of the White House under the cover of darkness on Christmas night for a trip to Iraq\n\n\"I literally stepped out, and I could see a trail coming towards me and thought let's have a look at what's on the end of that. And then I looked through the viewfinder and thought this is worth photographing, it's not just a normal airliner,\" Meloy told CNN.\n\nIt was that moment that the almost-retired IT project manager, who has been spotting planes for 40 years and enjoys keeping an eye on the skies, knew he was looking at something unique when he saw a distinct color scheme on the plane.\n\n\"I was absolutely amazed when that came past...I knew it was one of the two VC-25s,\" Meloy told CNN. \"I had no idea who was on it, it my mind I was thinking it must be someone pretty important.\"\n\nThe VC-25 is a modified Boeing 747-200 used to fly the President of the United States. Only two exist in the world and alternate as \"Air Force One.\"\n\nThe plane, which normally flies under the callsign \"AF1,\" had already sparked the interest of online aviation enthusiasts like \" CivMilAir ,\" a popular plane tracking enthusiast based in the UK, when it showed up on the map under the callsign \"RCH358\" or \"Reach 358.\" \"Reach\" is used by the military to designate cargo planes. The plane maintained an altitude of about 31,000 feet as it flew across the UK, according to flight logs.\n\nIt wasn't until Meloy snapped the picture of the plane that showed \"Reach 358\" was in fact \"Air Force One\" flying in disguise, except to the naked eye. He went online to post the picture to his Flickr account and see if anyone else had noticed the aircraft. While some online were intrigued and watching RCH358 others were skeptical, telling Meloy \"no it's not Air Force One, it's got a different callsign!\" he says.\n\n\"So all I said was I know what I've seen, it's a VC-25 there's only two of those in the world -- that's all I can tell you.

But stroll around here, and you're also likely to find used drug paraphernalia, trash, and human excrement on the sidewalks, and people lying in various states of consciousness.\n\nPublic drug usage and homelessness are not new problems for the city of San Francisco. But residents say the situation has gotten worse in recent years. As of October, 7,500 complaints about discarded needles have been made this year, compared with 6,363 last year. In 2015, the number was less than 3,000.\n\nIt's moved some locals -- so-called \"video vigilantes\" -- to document the mess they see, in an attempt to get the city's attention.\n\nAdam Mesnick, a restaurateur who lives and works in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood, started posting daily photos and videos of people using drugs in public, urinating near his restaurant, or lying passed out on the sidewalk.\n\n\"More mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco,\" Mesnick wrote in one post, accompanied by photos of angry sores on people's backs, hands and legs.\n\nmore mrsa and staph on the streets of San Francisco, homeless addicts.

In another, human feces lies nestled in front of a doorway. In a video apparently taken from inside Mesnick's restaurant, a man can be seen urinating in a doorway across the street.\n\nMesnick isn't trying to shame homeless people with his Twitter posts, he says, but \"to actually find help for these people.\" He's been giving leftover food from his restaurant to the homeless for the past ten years, he said.\n\nOver the past five or six years, Mesnick says, visible homelessness and drug use on the streets have seemed to spread from areas of San Francisco where they were once concentrated, like the Tenderloin.\n\nThis has been like this since Friday. Yes today is Monday. pic.twitter.com/d91e9MU2VY \u2014 bettersoma (@bettersoma) October 29, 2018\n\n\"It's like third world squalor,\" Mesnick said. \"I'm a small business (owner) trying to exist, and basically surrounded by decay that continues to get worse and worse and worse.\"\n\nOthers fear that the situation will impact tourism. \"If we can't find a solution to this problem,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, CEO of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, \"it will tarnish the city's brand.\"\n\nAnother longtime resident tweets about the state of the neighborhood using the handle @cleanupwestsoma. He asked to remain anonymous because his friends don't know he runs the account, and says he's lived in San Francisco for 21 years, 12 of them in SoMa.\n\n\"I post as I go to work. I'll sometimes come home from lunch and see a giant drug deal going on,\" he said. \"I'll leave and go back to work and see someone going to the bathroom in the street. It blows me away that this continues to happen in the city.\"\n\nMesnick and @cleanupwestsoma want to send a message to city officials about what's happening in their neighborhoods. They often tweet at San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who took office in a special election in July after the death of Mayor Ed Lee.\n\n\"You know what? I already had the message, as a native San Franciscan, as someone who's been here all my life,\" Breed told CNN. \"It isn't acceptable.\"\n\nBreed, 44, made tackling homelessness and drug addiction a signature of her campaign platform. She says the city has been making changes since she took office, and that they're slowly starting to have an impact. \"It's not an unsolvable problem,\" she said.\n\nLast week, the mayor announced a detailed plan to direct a $181 million cash windfall the city received from the state to homelessness, affordable housing and related problems. The proposal includes nearly $20 million to be spent on beds for patients who have addiction and mental health problems. An additional $4 million would go toward expanding street cleaning.\n\nAnd Breed says visible progress has already been made.\n\n\"If you walk with me right now, you will see the difference,\" she said. \"You'll see more police officers. You'll see the homeless outreach team. You'll see people power-washing on a regular basis and picking up trash.\" Tent encampments are down by 27% since she took office, she said.\n\nKevin Schwing, who works in SoMa, said that despite the city's efforts, he doesn't see a change in the numbers of people on the streets.\n\n\"I don't really know what the city can do,\" he said. \"The city cleans up sidewalks every day. But I don't see any difference in terms of the amount of people.\"\n\n\"I see human waste. Injections. Probably 10 times per day,\" he said. \"Sometimes people look like they're dead.\"\n\nBreed says the city is cracking down on drug dealing, and aims to open at least 1,000 new shelter beds by the end of 2020.\n\nAnd she's looking at new ways to approach these entrenched problems, she says. Breed supports safe injection sites -- facilities where people can inject heroin in a private setting and under the supervision of health care workers. The sites would \"not only be a way to get people off the streets and get the needles off the streets, but to get people into treatment,\" Breed said. California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have allowed safe injection sites in the state.\n\nShe also supports conservatorship programs for the severely mentally ill, which would allow the state to \"make decisions for them in order to place them into mental health stabilization beds, instead of our criminal justice system.\" Gov. Brown recently signed a bill that would allow such action to take place.\n\nBreed says she hopes the \"video vigilantes\" tag 311, the city's non-emergency complaint service center, in their posts. The information they're putting out helps the city address challenges in specific neighborhoods, she said.\n\nThe city's Department of Public Health recently partnered with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, essentially hiring contract workers to fan the streets and collect used needles.\n\nCrisis intervention teams have also stepped up their efforts to provide addicts with the drug buprenorphine, a narcotic to help reduce a person's addiction to heroin and other opioids.\n\n\"We go to people that are using drugs and offer them treatment instead of the traditional model which has people coming into a clinic,\" said Dr. Naveena Bobba, the department's deputy director of health.\n\nThe city has also launched the so-called \"poop patrol,\" a team that responds to complaints of feces on city streets.\n\nSoMa resident Alesia Panajota said she sees an impact. \"They're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I think things are getting better under London Breed.\"\n\nSan Francisco may also see an influx of cash to help solve the crisis, after a controversial ballot measure passed in November. Known as \"Prop C,\" the measure is viewed as a \"homeless tax\" -- it aims to raise $300 million a year to spend on homeless services by taxing big businesses.\n\nSalesforce Chairman and Co-CEO Marc Benioff spent at least $7 million of his own money to help ensure Prop C's passage. \"We have to say enough is enough,\" he recently told CNN.\n\nBut legal challenges could prevent the city from receiving the funds for several years.\n\nIn the meantime, Mesnick keeps posting. He recently put up a video interview with a homeless man talking about how difficult it is to find a place to go to the bathroom after dark.\n\n\"Help this guy,\" Mesnick wrote. \"Keep the restrooms open at night? Perhaps we change usage of our space and make it a bathroom share? Better than on our front stoop...\"\n\n\"We are in a severe epidemic here,\" he told CNN. \"My angle may seem to be a little rough around the edges, but it's really about compassion.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "One city's answer to preventing teen e-cigarette use: Sell in adult-only stores", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/a0oHJ8rqllg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Attempting to beat back the rise of vaping among teens, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, voted this month to limit e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes to the shelves of tobacco stores open only to customers 21 and older.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Massachusetts raising the legal age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21, which goes into effect on December 31.\n\nSomerville's move, the first of its kind in the state and possibly the nation, goes further by taking menthol and e-cigarettes out of shops, like convenience stores, that teens can enter.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn urges Theresa May to cut short MPs' break for vote", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46697749", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged the prime minister to cut short MPs' Christmas break to allow for an earlier vote on her Brexit deal.\n\nMPs are due back in the Commons on 7 January, and Theresa May has said the vote on the EU withdrawal agreement will take place the following week.\n\nHowever, in an interview with the Independent website, Mr Corbyn said it must happen \"as soon as possible\".\n\nA Downing Street source told the Press Association it was a \"silly demand\".\n\nThe vote on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the PM with Brussels had been due to take place on 11 December.

lecturer for sport and exercise sciences at the University of Exeter, we should also be focusing on improving our minds by building self-awareness.\n\nYou might think of this as something that prevents us from embarrassing ourselves, but, according to Dr Sammy, it is much more than this.\n\nSelf-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your moods, emotions and drives, and building it can play a crucial role in improving mental and physical wellbeing over time.\n\n\"By understanding your feelings, motivations and behaviours in more depth, you can begin to act more consciously in order to make better choices for yourself,\" she says.\n\n\"For instance, what is your motivation to exercise? When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?\"\n\nThere are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.\n\n\"Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,\" she adds.\n\nAdopt a dog\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There are particular health benefits in adopting a dog, says Dr Rhys Thatcher\n\nA gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.\n\nBut though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University.\n\nInstead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping.\n\nBut there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says.\n\nIf you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption.\n\n\"This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,\" says Dr Thatcher.\n\nGet your 30 a week\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say diversity of plant-based foods is also important\n\nWe have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nBut according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity.\n\nWe should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.\n\nThat is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health.\n\nThe bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.\n\nAllergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut.\n\nOne way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi.\n\n\"Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,\" she says.\n\nSmile more often\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Do not spend so much time focusing on arbitrary matters, do something that makes you smile instead\n\nAfter the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week.\n\nBut the problem with \"arbitrary\" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill.\n\nInstead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier.\n\n\"There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,\" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School.\n\nBut how do you go about becoming happier?\n\nDr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it.\n\n\"Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year.\"\n\nAnd finally, get enough sleep\n\nIt may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults).\n\nEven being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter.\n\nThere are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.\n\nBut Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "How to resist 'drink pushers' during the festive season", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46632332", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:00:47", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Midnight Oil Image caption Actor Stephen McGann gets indignant with those who try to make him drink alcohol\n\nWhen actor Stephen McGann recently tweeted about his frustration with people who pressurised others to drink alcohol, he received an outpouring of support on social media.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @StephenMcGann As Christmas gears up again, a quick seasonal request.

Sometimes it's just easier not to go out, as I get too tempted.\n\n\"Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.\"\n\nHaig notes British society's obsession with drinking. \"As soon as we get that off switch we drink. Go to Gatwick and you'll see people drinking at 08:00. It's changing, young people are drinking less, but I'll never be that Mediterranean person who can have one glass of wine.\"\n\nHis tips for being a non-drinker include ordering a virgin Bloody Mary, \"it feels hedonistic\", going to a restaurant rather than a bar or pub, doing exercise to replace that space where you \"let off steam\", and saying to those who try to foist drinks on you: \"I don't drink.\"\n\n\"People think there must be a reason and don't question it. It's about not feeling guilty, and not doing things out of obligation.

I tell them I'm a loose cannon. I make a joke out of it. Never be apologetic, people will leap on that.\"\n\n'Social loneliness'\n\nYet despite the fact that alcohol is deeply embedded in our social lives, the culture is changing. Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.\n\nEven so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.\n\nJennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.\n\n\"Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers. If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.\n\n\"The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist.\"\n\nGriffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.\n\nAs awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

From the stark warning from climate scientists about the dangers of letting temperatures rise beyond 1.5C to the discovery of a 20km-wide liquid water lake on Mars, it was a memorable year.\n\nHere's a rundown of some of 2018's most eye-catching stories.\n\nA \"safe\" limit for warming\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA rise in global temperatures of 2C by the end of this century has long been seen as the gateway to dangerous climate change. Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.\n\nBut some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.\n\nThis would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.\n\nBut it would also be hugely expensive and require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.\n\nOther climate change stories from 2018\n\nThe earliest animals\n\nImage copyright ANU\n\nThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nIn the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the \"Ediacaran biota\" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.\n\nBut their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.\n\nIn September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.\n\nOther palaeontology stories from 2018\n\nGiant plastic berg\n\nThe world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.\n\nIn April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.\n\nWorryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.\n\nOther plastic waste stories from 2018\n\nGhost particle busters\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: Blazars are powered by massive black holes\n\nNeutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.\n\nMany neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle \"ray\" straight at the Earth.\n\nThis type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.\n\nThe IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.\n\nOther astronomy stories from 2018\n\nA watery Mars - and Moon\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems Image caption The proposed lake sits beneath ice near the south pole of Mars\n\nWe know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.\n\nNasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.\n\n\"We are not closer to actually detecting life,\" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, \"but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.\"\n\nMars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.\n\nData from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.\n\nOther planetary science stories from 2018\n\nWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Stonehenge builders were largely replaced by the Beaker people, but pockets may have lingered\n\nThe field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.\n\nThe Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.\n\nIn a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to a girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.\n\nOther ancient DNA stories from 2018\n\nIcy impact\n\nImage copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nIn November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nThe bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.\n\nThere is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.\n\nOther earth science stories from 2018:\n\nAn earlier exodus\n\nImage copyright Israel Hershkovitz, Tel Aviv Uni Image caption The jawbone from Mislya cave in Israel dates to 185,000 years ago\n\nMultiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.\n\nIn January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.\n\nBut the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.\n\nOther human evolution stories from 2018\n\nRocks from Mars\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The mission would allow Martian rock and soil samples to be studied in labs on Earth\n\nAfter years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.\n\nIn April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first \"round trip\" to another planet.\n\nThe venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.\n\nUS missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.\n\nThere's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.\n\nOther space exploration stories from 2018\n\nPlastic in our water\n\nImage copyright Alice Trevail Image caption Some of the fragments are very small\n\nPlastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water. Research by the journalism organisation Orb Media found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre in major brands of bottled water.\n\nIn the largest investigation of its kind, 250 bottles bought in nine different countries were examined. Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.\n\nOur planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.\n\nThe number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean. Scientists said there was a need for more research into its effects on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Plastic bag fee 'to double to 10p' and include every shop", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46689684", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA\n\nThe 5p fee for plastic carrier bags in England will be doubled to 10p, and extended to all shops, under plans set out by the environment secretary.\n\nThe change is contained in a government consultation aimed at further reducing the plastic used by consumers and could come into effect in January 2020.\n\nSmaller retailers, who are exempt from the current levy, supply an estimated 3.6 billion single-use bags annually.\n\nSchools in England are also being told to eliminate unnecessary plastic.\n\nEducation Secretary Damian Hinds is urging school leaders to replace items such as plastic straws, bottles and food packaging with sustainable alternatives by 2022.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five ways to break up with plastic\n\nIn August, Theresa May promised there would be a consultation on changes to the plastic bag levy.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove said: \"We want to do even more to protect our precious planet and today's announcement will accelerate further behaviour change and build on the success of the existing charge.\"\n\nSince the 5p fee was introduced in 2015 for retailers with at least 250 employees, an estimated 15 billion bags have been taken out of circulation.\n\nTrade bodies representing about 40,000 small retailers have launched a voluntary approach to a 5p charge, but this accounts for less than one-fifth of companies likely to be affected by the proposed changes.\n\nAnalysis\n\nby Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst\n\nThe government wavered for years before imposing a plastic bag tax for England - but the result of the policy eventually introduced is crystal clear: taxes change behaviour.\n\nPeople who previously thought nothing of carting home their supermarket shopping in half a dozen flimsy plastic bags seem appalled by the prospect of a 30p charge, and dig into their handbags for nylon bags instead.\n\nA similar shift in behaviour will surely be seen now in local stores, although the change may be less marked because people tend to buy smaller quantities from corner shops, so may be willing to pay an extra 10p for convenience.\n\nIt's also possible that these convenience store bags disproportionately harm the environment because they're used by people picking up snacks while visiting beauty spots or beaches.\n\nThe announcement of a consultation on an increased charge is part of a broader move towards environmental taxation - an issue which can easily cause governments trouble if they don't protect the poorest from the impact of the taxes.\n\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all retailers - including smaller shops - already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society says the levies have had an impact on reducing plastic waste on beaches and in the sea.\n\nOceanographer Laura Foster, head of Clean Seas at the MCS, said: \"We are able to measure the impact of legislation and we've seen that since the introduction of the plastic bag charge in the UK the amount we find on the beaches has gone down.\n\n\"That's also been replicated by studies that have been done offshore. They've also seen a reduction in the amount of plastic bags they find.\"\n\nWhile retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money consumers pay for plastic bags, they are expected to give it to good causes. According to Defra, an estimated \u00a351m was donated in 2017-18.\n\nThe Association of Convenience Stores, which is backing Defra's plans, says about half of the small shops it represents in England are currently charging for plastic bags.\n\nACS chief executive James Lowman said: \"This has been shown to be highly effective at reducing waste, whilst also raising money for local, national and environmental charities.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "The Most Indifferent Animals At The Petting Zoo This Year", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/the-most-indifferent-animals-at-the-petting-zoo-this-ye-1831303137", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:08", "body_paragraphs": "The Big Sheep: It\u2019s frustrating being told to \u201cwatch your fingers,\u201d but what\u2019s even more frustrating is offering them and not getting so much as a nibble.\n\nRabbit: We don\u2019t know what it looks like when a rabbit is excited, but that wasn\u2019t it.\n\nLlama: It was kinda cool to see a Llama, but it wanted nothing to do with us.

Two days after the current protests started in Sudan on Wednesday, December 19, I said on Al Jazeera that I would be surprised if the regime of President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan lasted till Friday morning.\n\nA week later, al-Bashir's troops are using brutal violence to suppress the protests. But I stand by my initial assessment. Having suddenly lost all residual legitimacy, the current regime is facing an apparently unstoppable surge of popular anger, even by earlier Sudanese standards. Massive violence will only make matters worse. Only a miracle, or a major miscalculation by protesters, will save it from its inevitable fate.\n\nHow Sudan got here\n\nAl-Bashir came to power in a military coup in June 1989, promising to end a situation of food shortages and economic meltdown similar to the ones he is presiding over today, complicated by rising insecurity and escalating civil war. However, his regime then exacerbated the economic woes and escalated the civil war exponentially.\n\nAs if this was not enough, the regime engaged in various external adventures, supporting Saddam Hussain's foray in Kuwait, alienating a large number of regional powers and facing accusations of supporting terrorism. The result was international isolation, with more adverse impact on the economy.\n\nA number of developments saved the regime. In 1999, oil production started in South Sudan, slowly easing the economic hardship. A split within the regime that same year, ironically improved its chances of survival.\n\nWhen religious leader Hassan al-Turabi, the regime's erstwhile Godfather, lost a power struggle, the impression was created that a more \"moderate\" wing of the ruling Islamists was now in charge. Discreet intelligence cooperation with the United States followed, coupled with overt cooperation on tackling the civil war. This eventually led to an internationally acclaimed peace agreement.\n\nA new constitution was proclaimed in 2005, together with a government in which power was shared with former Southern rebels. Opposition parties were permitted to function openly and given seats in parliament.\n\nHowever, just as the regime was coming out of isolation and revelling in a newly acquired legitimacy and relative economic prosperity, horrendous atrocities in a new war that broke out in Darfur in 2003 brought unprecedented international opprobrium. Al-Bashir was indicted in 2008 for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Then South Sudan voted to secede in January 2011, in an uncanny coincidence with the Arab Spring.\n\nSurprisingly, no massive protests erupted then, in spite of attempts by young activists to emulate their peers in other Arab countries in organising protests using social media. The response was remarkably lukewarm. On the appointed day, even the organisers failed to turn up. Muhammad Ibrahim Nugud, the late secretary-general of the Sudanese Communist Party arrived with a handful of his supporters to find the square empty. He sarcastically scribbled a note addressed to his supposed fellow protesters on a piece of cardboard which read: \"We called, but you weren't in\".\n\nA more substantive wave of protests erupted in the capital Khartoum in September 2013. However, brutal action by the government swiftly put an end to those, at the cost of more than 200 lives in one week. This only intensified and broadened anti-regime anger. However, the protests also lost momentum because many were alienated by the violence that accompanied them. Pro-government media exploited that element ruthlessly (as it is doing today, but with less success).\n\nThe regime then launched a process of \"National Dialogue\" in early 2014. An apparent breakthrough happened when al-Turabi, who became the regime's bitterest and most effective adversary, suddenly agreed to join in. The process looked promising until al-Bashir showed his real hand and refused to give any meaningful concessions.\n\nParticipants wanted a new constitution and actual power-sharing. However, the regime insisted on holding a rigged election in 2015 to give al-Bashir a new term, ignoring opposition demands for a postponement, and arguments that the president had already served the two terms permitted under the 2005 constitution.\n\nThe whole process unravelled and things were back to square one. The economy went into a tailspin, in spite of the lifting of US sanctions by the Obama administration. The government made things worse by drying up cash in the banks to stem a downward spiral in the value of the currency. The majority of the Sudanese, who live on a pittance, were suddenly unable to access their own funds in the banks, which compounded their misery and induced an economic downturn.\n\nThe callous insensitivity of the regime to this misery and its preoccupation with getting the president a new term through amending the constitution fueled popular anger.\n\nWhat will happen with the protests?\n\nOminously, the current uprisings started in the northern Sudanese town of Atbara, formerly a railway hub, and neighbouring Berber, which happens to be my hometown. It then spread to various northern riverain towns, before reaching other outlying towns, and finally Khartoum. This all happened within 24 hours.\n\nThe riverain region is widely trumpeted as (or accused of being) the regime's stronghold since most of its strongmen hail from there. Regardless of the validity of this claim, the fact that the protests were ignited there should be very worrying for al-Bashir and his circle. The regime depends mainly on a core of hardline Islamists but the majority of those have also deserted. The regime has compensated by enlisting an assortment of constituencies and a raft of opportunists, including a contingent of the notorious Janjaweed tribal militias that terrorised Darfur during the last decade.\n\nHowever, the rhetoric of the bulk of the leaders of the revolution is harshly and uncompromisingly anti-Islamist. There is a reason for this. The regime has probably done much more to discredit Islamism than the usual anti-Islamist suspects in Egypt and the UAE.\n\nFor most Sudanese, Islamism came to signify corruption, hypocrisy, cruelty and bad faith. Sudan is perhaps the first genuinely anti-Islamist country in popular terms. But being anti-Islamist in Sudan does not mean being secular.\n\nThe bulk of protesters use a pious language of which even hardline Islamist would approve. However, the strident anti-Islamist rhetoric and threats of reprisals against all regime supporters might cause many of those to circle the wagons around the regime for self-protection. A vicious spiral might impose itself, with the regime using massive brutality as it feels cornered, thus intensifying the mass popular anger against it and fanning the flames of more protest.\n\nThe resulting polarisation would be disastrous for a country that needs peace more than anything else. The regime is trying to repeat the 2013 \"success\": Threatening and using mass violence, while working hard to sow divisions among the people rising against it.\n\nIts chances of success are slim, given it has nothing to offer other than fear and polarisation. Al-Bashir has been given more chances to redeem himself than any other ruler in the region. I once counted seven major occasions when he could have opted to bring the country together and move it forward. Each time he has chosen his narrow interest and that of the small corrupt clique around him.\n\nIf he wants to avoid the fate of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and other failed Arab despots, he would be wise to join deposed Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Jeddah and allow the country to heal and put itself together again without the unnecessary agony.\n\nSudan's revolutionary experience\n\nSudan is a (largely neglected) school in democratic revolutionary practice, starting with its peacefully negotiated self-government in 1953 and independence three years later. The elite used exclusively peaceful protests and negotiations to achieve their goals.\n\nIt helped that Sudan was able to play the two \"colonial powers\" (Britain and Egypt) against each other. Interestingly, the self-government act promulgated by the British in 1953, was used, with slight modifications, as the constitution of all democratic governments in Sudan (1956, 1964 and 1985-6). The popular uprisings of October 1964 and April 1985 proceeded according to an almost identical script.\n\nStudent protests received the backing of trade unions and professional organisations, resulting in mass protests. Political parties then joined in, and influential sections within the military refused to take part in the repression, forcing the regime to cede power. A peaceful transition followed, with minimal disruption of the state or the economy, and no reprisals against former regime supporters. The process took one week in 1964, 12 days in 1985.\n\nThe current wave of protest is different in several important ways. This was not an elite-driven process, but a genuinely popular uprising, emanating from the periphery, not from Khartoum. It is thus virtually leaderless, much more so than the Arab uprisings, where media-savvy youth played a loose managerial role.\n\nIt is also a highly polarised affair. The current regime, unlike earlier ones, does have a residual core of popular support and a hard-core militant base, heavily armed and ready to fight. Political and civil society leaders are scrambling to replay the old script. On Christmas Day, they assembled a protest led by professional organisations, which voiced specific demands of regime change. Activists plan a campaign of civil disobedience and a series of mass protests and are working to forge consensus on change.\n\nHowever, if no meaningful effort is made to win over the (largely Islamist) military and enlist disaffected Islamists, conflict may ensue. The difference between a popular uprising and a civil war is the degree of isolation of the regime.\n\nIt is a supreme irony that al-Bashir's current woes started only a couple of days after his return from a controversial visit to Syria, where he embraced his fellow genocidal despot, Bashar al-Assad. It is not known what advice he received from Damascus, but it is certain that Sudan cannot endure a \"Syrian scenario\" of protracted murderous carnage that would destroy what little the country has.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

LNG also competes with such zero-carbon sources of electricity as nuclear, solar and wind \u2014 potentially delaying the full adoption of greener sources. That's time climate scientists and researchers say the world doesn't have if humans hope to mitigate the worst-case consequences of our carbon emissions, including catastrophic sea-level rise, stronger storms and more wildfires.\n\n\n\n\"Typically, infrastructure has multi-decadal lifespans,\" said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. \"So, if we build a natural-gas plant today, that will impact carbon emissions over decades to come. So those are the critical and crucial decisions that are being made today. Do we increase access to and use of fossil fuels, or do we make decisions that limit and eventually reduce access to fossil fuels?\"\n\nBoon to shipyards\n\nWhile it is difficult to estimate how much America's rise as major exporter of fossil fuels is contributing to a hotter climate, some of the economic benefits are plain to see in South Korea's shipyards.\n\n\n\nAt the sprawling Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering facility on the island of Geoje, more than half of the 35 vessels scheduled for delivery in 2018 were LNG carriers. A similar number of vessels are lined up for completion next year.\n\n\n\nIt's the same story at the two other major Korean yards. The construction of the big gas tankers has been credited with lifting the nation's shipbuilding sector out of the doldrums from a decade ago, when the Great Recession caused a downturn in transoceanic trade.\n\nSouth Korea's big three shipbuilders \u2014 Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries \u2014 won orders for 53 new LNG carriers in 2018 at about $200 million each, soaking up the lion's share of the 62 vessels ordered globally, according to numbers compiled by the London-based shipping group Clarkson Research. South Korea is expected to finish 2018 at the top spot in overall orders for new commercial ships, surpassing China for the first time in seven years.\n\n\n\n\"We are getting out of a long tunnel,\" Song Ha-dong, a senior Daewoo executive, said as he surveyed the company's 1,200-acre yard from above the British Contributor, a gargantuan LNG carrier with a freshly painted deck covered in a maze of pipes. \"The U.S.-led shale gas boom is getting fully under way, and China, Japan and South Korea are increasing their consumption of natural gas.\"\n\nDuring a recent visit by The Associated Press, three of the LNG carriers were being assembled inside a massive dry dock. Another 13, including the British Contributor, had been floated out to nearby berths where workers were putting on finishing touches.\n\n\n\nThe Korean shipyards have developed a niche in building ships with the complex systems needed to transport natural gas. The gas is compressed and liquefied for storage by keeping it really cold, about -260 Fahrenheit. In this liquid state, natural gas is about 600 times smaller than at room temperature.\n\nTop three importers\n\n\n\nThe British Contributor is as long as three football fields and can carry enough liquefied gas to fill about 70 Olympic-sized swimming pools \u2014 nearly two days' national supply for South Korea. The country used about 1.9 trillion cubic feet of LNG in 2017, finishing third behind China and Japan as the world's biggest importers, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\n\nWith no domestic oil and gas resources and an unfriendly neighbor blocking overland shipments from the north, South Korea relies exclusively on oceangoing tankers. Nearly half of South Korea's gas imports come from Qatar and Australia, but the share shipped from the U.S. is growing fast as additional export terminals along the Gulf coast are coming online to handle the glut of gas unleashed by hydraulic fracturing in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.\n\n\n\nU.S. LNG exports quadrupled in 2017, with this year on track to see similarly exponential growth. Nearly a fifth of all that gas goes to South Korea.\n\nThe British Contributor is the third of six LNG carriers being built by Daewoo for British energy giant BP, which will mainly use them to transport U.S. gas to Asia under a 20-year contract with the Freeport LNG facility south of Houston. Daewoo delivered four similar ships this year to the government-owned Korea Gas Corporation, which has a 20-year deal to buy gas exported from Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea has been vying with Mexico for the title of the largest importer of U.S. LNG, and its reliance on gas could further increase under the government of President Moon Jae-in, who has pledged to transition his country away from nuclear power following the Fukushima meltdown in Japan.\n\n\n\nPark Moo-hyun, a senior analyst at Hana Financial Investment, predicts shipping companies will need to place orders for around 480 new LNG carriers over the next decade to match the U.S.-driven increase in global LNG trade \u2014 roughly doubling the current worldwide fleet.\n\n\n\n\"The impact brought by the emergence of shale is not just about an increase in U.S. energy exports \u2014 there has been tremendous growth in the production of energy sources that hadn't been used much, such as LNG,\" Park said. \"Once the groundwork is established for the stable use of these new energy sources, industries are pushed to adapt.\"\n\n\n\nNatural gas has the added appeal of producing about half the carbon dioxide of coal when it's burned. Its increased adoption for generating electricity has been pitched by the U.S. and others as a way for nations to make progress toward meeting their emissions reductions goals under the 2015 Paris climate accord. Burning gas also creates less particulate pollution.\n\n\n\nIn China, the Communist government has declared a \"Blue Sky Defense War\" to reduce the choking smog in Beijing and two dozen surrounding cities with a program to convert hundreds of thousands of homes and industrial facilities from burning coal to gas. In February, Texas-based Cheniere signed a 25-year deal with the state-controlled China National Petroleum Corporation to export LNG from its export terminal in Corpus Christi.\n\nCarbon emissions increase\n\n\n\nBut the increased gas exports from the U.S. and other sources hasn't really put much of dent in Chinese coal consumption, which has remained largely flat in 2018. Overall carbon emissions for China, the globe's biggest emitter, increased nearly 5 percent in 2018.\n\nDaniel Raimi, a researcher at the Washington-based think tank Resources for the Future, said determining whether U.S. gas exports are a net good or bad for the climate is difficult. When considering China, researchers can't just look at whether coal use or carbon emissions are falling. They must also try to calculate how much more coal would have been burned had ample supplies of gas not been available.\n\n\n\nAnother challenge is that the primary component of natural gas is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps far more heat in the atmosphere than a comparable amount of carbon dioxide. Studies have shown that a significant amount of natural gas leaks into the air at almost every stage of its production and transport \u2014 from wells to pipelines, processing facilities to ships. Raimi said the impact of all that leaking methane on the climate is roughly 84 times more powerful than the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.\n\n\n\nAs part of its broad rollback of environmental rules, the Trump administration moved in September to weaken Obama-era regulations designed to prevent methane from escaping into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. The regulatory rollbacks are part of President Donald Trump's pro-industry \"Energy Dominance\" strategy to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production without concern for the corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Trump has falsely claimed climate change is a \"hoax,\" and he moved in 2017 to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris accord.\n\n\n\n\"With or without increased U.S. oil and gas exports, ambitious policy measures are the essential ingredient to achieving long-term climate goals such as those laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement,\" Raimi said. \"For U.S. LNG exports to reduce global emissions, they must primarily displace coal, and methane emissions must be limited both domestically and abroad.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Agency Offers Advice to Cash-Strapped Workers", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-offers-advice-to-cash-strapped-workers/4719395.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "As the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government stretched into its sixth day with no end in sight, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is offering advice on how to deal with an interrupted cash flow.\n\nNearly 800,000 federal employees have either been furloughed or will be working without pay and facing potential problems paying bills and meeting other expenses.\n\n\"Feds, here are sample letters you may use as a guide when working with your creditors during this furlough,\" the agency said in a tweet Thursday, directing the reader to its website.\n\nOPM suggested workers call their landlord, mortgage company, or creditor to speak with them about their situation.

Before birth, babies can have a split, or cleft, in their lip and the roof of the mouth. This split normally closes between the 6th to 11th week of pregnancy. If this doesn't happen, and the baby is born with this split, doctors can usually fix it. But if the cleft isn't fixed, the baby can have serious health problems and a shortened life.\n\nIn the U.S. and other developed countries, corrective surgery is done when a baby is between three months and 18 months old. Surgical intervention is less common in less developed nations.\n\nDr. Albert Oh, a pediatric plastic surgeon, said he performs one or two corrective surgeries a week at Children's National hospital in Washington.\n\n\"We\u2019re one of the busiest centers in the United States, and so my partner and I, we average over a hundred primary cases per year.\"\n\n\n\nAbout one out of every 1,500 babies in the U.S. is born with a cleft palate.

But complications from a cleft lip and cleft palate go beyond the cosmetic. They impact speech and cause dental problems. A baby with a cleft palate cannot suck and is at risk of being malnourished. Malnutrition, in turn, causes stunted growth.\n\nDr. Ben Gitterman, a pediatrician who has worked as a volunteer in low-income countries to help these children, said the experience was life-changing.\n\n\"Seeing these kids and thinking, 'What a cute little 3 or 4 year old,' and finding that 3 or 4 year old was 7, 8 or 9.

Not malnutrition from the lack of food in the community, but because they couldn\u2019t feed properly because of the cleft lip and palate situation. These were tiny little kids, and I was in shock.\"\n\nGitterman has volunteered numerous times with Operation Smile, one of the charities that organizes surgical missions to help these children. In a Skype interview with Dr. Bill Magee, Operation Smile's founder, Magee said his organization's mission has expanded in the more than 35 years of its existence.\n\n\"Up until about 1999, all of our volunteers pretty much came out of the United States.

Curren hopes to expand internationally by 2020.\n\n\u201cA lot of the problem is keeping up with growth,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal marijuana was a $10.4 billion industry in the U.S. in 2018 with a quarter-million jobs devoted just to the handling of marijuana plants, said Beau Whitney, vice president and senior economist at New Frontier Data, a leading cannabis market research and data analysis firm. There are many other jobs that don\u2019t involve direct work with the plants but they are harder to quantify, Whitney said.\n\nInvestors poured $10 billion into cannabis in North America in 2018, twice what was invested in the last three years combined, he said, and the combined North American market is expected to reach more than $16 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cInvestors are getting much savvier when it comes to this space because even just a couple of years ago, you\u2019d throw money at it and hope that something would stick,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now investors are much more discerning.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, U.S. lawmakers see that success and want it for their states.\n\nNearly two-thirds of U.S. states now have legalized some form of medical marijuana.\n\nVoters in November made Michigan the 10th state \u2014 and first in the Midwest \u2014 to legalize recreational marijuana. Governors in New York and New Jersey are pushing for a similar law in their states next year, and momentum for broad legalization is building in Pennsylvania and Illinois.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s legalize the adult use of recreational marijuana once and for all,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last week.\n\nState lawmakers in Nebraska just formed a campaign committee to put a medical cannabis initiative to voters in 2020. Nebraska shares a border with Colorado, one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana, and Iowa, which recently started a limited medical marijuana program.\n\n\u201cAttitudes have been rapidly evolving and changing. I know that my attitude toward it has also changed,\u201d said Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat. \u201cSeeing the medical benefits and seeing other states implement it ... has convinced me that it\u2019s not the dangerous drug it\u2019s made out to be.\u201d\n\nWith all its success, the U.S. marijuana industry continues to be undercut by a robust black market and federal law that treats marijuana as a controlled substance like heroin. Financial institutions are skittish about cannabis businesses, even in U.S. states where they are legal, and investors until recently have been reluctant to put their money behind pot.\n\nMarijuana businesses can\u2019t deduct their business expenses on their federal taxes and face huge challenges getting insurance and finding real estate for their brick-and-mortar operations.\n\n\u201cUntil you have complete federal legalization, you\u2019re going to be living with that structure,\u201d said Marc Press, a New Jersey attorney who advises cannabis businesses.\n\nAt the start of the year, the industry was chilled when then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded a policy shielding state-licensed medical marijuana operators from federal drug prosecutions. Ultimately the move had minimal impact because federal prosecutors showed little interest in going after legal operators.\n\nSessions, a staunch marijuana opponent, later lost his job while President Donald Trump said he was inclined to support an effort by U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, to relax the federal prohibition.\n\nIn November, Democrats won control of the U.S. House and want to use it next year to pass legislation that eases federal restrictions on the legal marijuana industry without removing it from the controlled substances list.\n\nGardner and Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren have proposed legislation allowing state-approved commercial cannabis activity under federal law. The bill also would let states and Indian tribes determine how best to regulate marijuana commerce within their boundaries without fear of federal intervention.\n\nIf those provisions become law, they could open up banking for the marijuana industry nationwide and make it easier for cannabis companies to secure capital.\n\nBlumenauer\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to legalize marijuana also calls for the federal government to provide medical marijuana for veterans, more equitable taxation for marijuana businesses and rolling back federal prohibitions on marijuana research, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe have elected the most pro-cannabis Congress in history and more important, some of the people who were roadblocks to our work ... are gone,\u201d Blumenauer said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to jump-start it in the House, I think there will be support in the Senate, particularly if we deal with things that are important, like veterans\u2019 access and banking.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Japan to Leave International Whaling Commission; Resume Commercial Whaling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-to-leave-international-whaling-commission-resume-commercial-whaling/4717431.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Japan will withdraw from the International Whaling Commission and resume commercial whaling in July.

From 2019 authorities can build evidence against you from material provided by email services and social media networks including Facebook. Yet the country, mindful of its role in the emerging digital economy, won\u2019t close down websites the way China does.\n\nVietnam has long walked a thin line between a free internet as part of its economic growth and resistance against what market research firm IDC\u2019s country manager Lam Nguyen calls \u201cdigital disasters.\u201d The country is getting testier toward online dissent at the same time.\n\nA draft Cybersecurity Law decree to take effect Jan. 1 after 18 months in the making will help the communist government reach these goals by ordering service providers to do some of its surveillance work.\n\nDespite objections from Google and Facebook, global social media as well as email and e-commerce providers may be asked to store data in Vietnam, according to the Cybersecurity Law. Alternately, they can self-censor, turn over customer profiles and delete certain content, Nguyen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying OK, as an online service provider with Vietnam users, you do collect data about such users and their online activities, but you are letting users use your platform or services for unlawful activities, so please come to the front of the line (so) that we can keep an eye out for you,\u201d said Yee Chung Seck, partner with the Baker McKenzie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nCatching up in cybersecurity\n\nAccording to a United Nations index, Vietnam ranked 101 out of 165 countries in exposure to cyberattacks.\n\n\u201cVietnam has been historically weak when in it comes to cybersecurity,\u201d cyber intelligence analyst Emilio Iasiello wrote in a commentary for the Cyber Research Databank.\n\nDomestic websites were hit by more than 6,500 malware or phishing attacks in the first eight months of 2018, Viet Nam News reports.\n\nVietnam does not block the websites of foreign internet services that could spread objectionable content. Vietnam, like much of Asia, is trying to develop a digital economy, but unlike China it lacks easy-to-control homegrown alternates to the major Silicon Valley internet firms.\n\n\u201cObviously, the business and user communities are more likely hoping to avoid censorship of the internet outright, due to the growing digital commerce economy and also wanting a platform where freedom of expressions and opinions are allowed,\u201d Nguyen said.\n\nA digital economy gives Vietnam an opportunity to resolve \u201cbig issues in its economic development,\u201d the deputy minister of industry and trade was quoted saying in June. The manufacturing-reliant economy has grown 6 to 7 percent per year since 2012.\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnam\u2019s 92 million people use the internet, with 53 million on social media sites.\n\nProtest from multinational internet content providers\n\nAfter Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly approved the Cybersecurity Law in June, 17 U.S. congressional representatives sent a letter to Google and Facebook. They urged both to avoid storing data in Vietnam, to establish \u201ctransparent guidelines\u201d on content removal and to publish the number of requests for removal.\n\nFacebook, Google and other foreign internet companies said earlier this month via a lobbying group that requirements to localize data would hobble investment and economic growth in Vietnam. The law also requires firms with more than 10,000 local users to set up local representative offices.\n\nFacebook said for this report it \u201cremains committed to its community in Vietnam and in helping Vietnamese businesses grow at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nInternet providers also worry the cybersecurity law gives \u201ctoo much power\u201d to Vietnam\u2019s police ministry and lacks \u201cdue process,\u201d Nguyen said. Authorities, they fear, could \u201cseize customer data\u201d and expose a provider\u2019s users, partners or employees to arrest, which goes against privacy protection policies, he said.\n\n\u200bFear among online activists\n\nVietnam is looking to the cybersecurity law as well to control public criticism of government activity, activist bloggers believe. A string of Vietnamese bloggers was arrested in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAuthorities will be able to collect user names, profiles and data on their friends, media reports and analysts say.\n\n\u201cThis law threatens and further curbs freedom to information, infringes (on) personal privacy, and will be certainly used as a tool to give more power to police force, which violates rights, even on behalf of the court on judging on the use of internet,\u201d Hanoi-based internet blogger and human rights activist Nguyen Lan Thang said.\n\nVietnamese activists leaned heavily on internet media to spread information about what they considered slow government reaction to a mass fish die-off in 2016. They use it now to decry corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Cybersecurity Law will have a huge impact on Vietnam\u2019s dissidents and online activists.

That's what makes this deep-freeze target so enticing; it's a preserved relic dating all the way back to our solar system's origin 4.5 billion years ago. No spacecraft has visited anything so primitive.\n\n\n\n\"What could be more exciting than that?\" said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins University, part of the New Horizons team.\n\n\n\nLead scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, expects the New Year's encounter to be riskier and more difficult than the rendezvous with Pluto: The spacecraft is older, the target is smaller, the flyby is closer and the distance from us is greater.\n\n\n\nNew horizons\n\n\n\nNASA launched the spacecraft in 2006; it's about the size of a baby grand piano. It flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the dwarf planet. With the wildly successful flyby behind them, mission planners won an extension from NASA and set their sights on a destination deep inside the Kuiper Belt. As distant as it is, Pluto is barely in the Kuiper Belt, the so-called Twilight Zone stretching beyond Neptune. Ultima Thule is in the Twilight Zone's heart.\n\n\n\nUltima Thule\n\n\n\nThis Kuiper Belt object was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2014. Officially known as 2014 MU69, it got the nickname Ultima Thule in an online vote. In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world. When New Horizons first glimpsed the rocky iceball in August it was just a dot. Good close-up pictures should be available the day after the flyby.\n\nAre we there yet ?\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will make its closest approach in the wee hours of Jan. 1 \u2014 12:33 a.m. EST. The spacecraft will zoom within 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, its seven science instruments going full blast. The coast should be clear: Scientists have yet to find any rings or moons around it that could batter the spacecraft. New Horizons hurtles through space at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), and even something as minuscule as a grain of rice could demolish it. \"There's some danger and some suspense,\" Stern said at a fall meeting of astronomers. It will take about 10 hours to get confirmation that the spacecraft completed \u2014 and survived \u2014 the encounter.\n\n\n\nPossibly twins\n\n\n\nScientists speculate Ultima Thule could be two objects closely orbiting one another. If a solo act, it's likely 20 miles (32 kilometers) long at most. Envision a baked potato. \"Cucumber, whatever. Pick your favorite vegetable,\" said astronomer Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins. It could even be two bodies connected by a neck. If twins, each could be 9 miles to 12 miles (15 kilometers to 20 kilometers) in diameter.\n\n\n\nMapping mission\n\n\n\nScientists will map Ultima Thule every possible way. They anticipate impact craters, possibly also pits and sinkholes, but its surface also could prove to be smooth. As for color, Ultima Thule should be darker than coal, burned by eons of cosmic rays, with a reddish hue. Nothing is certain, though, including its orbit, so big that it takes almost 300 of our Earth years to circle the sun. Scientists say they know just enough about the orbit to intercept it.\n\n\n\nComparing flybys\n\n\n\nNew Horizons will get considerably closer to Ultima Thule than it did to Pluto: 2,220 miles versus 7,770 miles (3,500 kilometers vs. 12,500 kilometers). At the same time, Ultima Thule is 100 times smaller than Pluto and therefore harder to track, making everything more challenging. It took 4 { hours, each way, for flight controllers at Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, Maryland, to get a message to or from New Horizons at Pluto. Compare that with more than six hours at Ultima Thule.\n\n\n\nWhat's next\n\n\n\nIt will take almost two years for New Horizons to beam back all its data on Ultima Thule. A flyby of an even more distant world could be in the offing in the 2020s, if NASA approves another mission extension and the spacecraft remains healthy. At the very least, the nuclear-powered New Horizons will continue to observe objects from afar, as it pushes deeper into the Kuiper Belt. There are countless objects out there, waiting to be explored."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Source: Foxconn to Begin Assembling Top-End Apple iPhones in India in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/foxconn-to-begin-assembling-top-end-apple-iphones-in-india-in-2019-source/4718218.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Apple Inc will begin assembling its top-end iPhones in India through the local unit of Foxconn as early as 2019, the first time the Taiwanese contract manufacturer will have made the product in the country, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nImportantly, Foxconn will be assembling the most expensive models, such as devices in the flagship iPhone X family, the source said, potentially taking Apple's business in India to a new level.\n\nThe work will take place at Foxconn's plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorized to speak to the media and so declined to be named.\n\nFoxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters.\n\nThe investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added. Another source also said Foxconn planned to assemble iPhones in India, in a move that could help both it and Apple to limit the impact of a trade war between the United States and China.\n\nThe Hindu newspaper first reported on Dec. 24 that the Foxconn plant would begin manufacturing various models of the iPhone.

If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China.\n\nFoxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact.\n\n\"Widening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,\" said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation.\n\nIndian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple's headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments.\n\nMaking more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said.\n\nApple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.\n\nFoxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple's flagship devices."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "'Tech Addicts' Seek Solace in 12 Steps and Rehab", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-addicts-seek-solace-in-twelve-steps-and-rehab/4716812.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "We like to say we're addicted to our phones or an app or some new show on a streaming video service.\n\nBut for some people, tech gets in the way of daily functioning and self-care.

By early elementary school, he got his first Super Nintendo system and spent hours playing Yoshi's Story, a game where the main character searched for \"lucky fruit.\"\n\nAs he grew, so did one of the world's major tech hubs. Led by Microsoft, it rose from the nondescript suburban landscape and farm fields here, just a short drive from the home he still shares with his mom, who split from her husband when their only child was 11.\n\nAs a teen, he took an interest in music and acting but recalls how playing games increasingly became a way to escape life. \"I go online instead of dealing with my feelings,\" he says.\n\nHe'd been seeing a therapist for depression and severe social anxiety. But attending college out of state allowed more freedom and less structure, so he spent even more time online. His grades plummeted, forcing him to change majors, from engineering to business.\n\nAfter graduating in 2016 and moving home, he'd go to a nearby restaurant or the library to use the Wi-Fi, claiming he was looking for a job but having no luck.\n\nInstead, he was spending hours on Reddit, an online forum where people share news and comments, or viewing YouTube videos. Sometimes, he watched online porn.\n\n\u200b'Detox'\n\nOthers who attend a 12-step meeting of the Internet & Tech Addiction Anonymous know the struggle.\n\n\"I had to be convinced that this was a 'thing,\"' says Walker, a 19-year-old from Washington whose parents insisted he get help after video gaming trashed his first semester of college. He agreed to speak only if identified by first name, as required by the 12-step tenets.\n\nHelp is found at facilities like reSTART. Clients \"detox\" from tech at a secluded ranch and move on to a group home.\n\nThey commit to eating well and regular sleep and exercise. They find jobs, and many eventually return to college. They also make \"bottom line\" promises to give up video games or any other problem content, as well as drugs and alcohol, if those are issues. They use monitored smartphones with limited function \u2014 calls, texts and emails and access to maps.\n\nThe young tech worker didn't go to reSTART. But he, too, has apps on his phone that send reports about what he's viewing to his 12-step sponsor, a fellow tech addict named Charlie, a 30-year-old reSTART graduate.\n\nAt home, the young man also persuaded his mom to get rid of Wi-Fi to lessen the temptation.\n\nHe still relapses every couple months, often when he's tired or upset or very bored. He tells himself that his problem isn't as bad as other tech addicts.\n\n\"Then,\" the young man says, \"I discover very quickly that I am actually an addict, and I do need to do this.\"\n\nHaving Charlie to lean on helps. \"He's a role model,\" he says.\n\n\"He has a place of his own.

The Ravenswood Generating Station, the towering four-smokestack facility on the East River in Long Island City, burns another 3,264,000 gallons per year and was ranked as the state\u2019s largest carbon polluter in 2014.\n\nThe New York City Department of Health found higher air pollution levels in Astoria and Long Island City than the rest of the borough or city. According to the city\u2019s most recent community health report for the neighborhoods, the levels of PM2.5 \u2015 the most harmful type of particulate matter, fine-grain pollutants that wedge into lungs when inhaled \u2015 hit 8.9 micrograms per cubic meter. That compared to 8.5 micrograms per cubic meter in Queens overall and 8.6 citywide.\n\nLocal officials have long blamed the plants for higher levels of asthma, and last year the city council passed a bill requiring the utility operators to stop using fuel oil number 6 by 2020 and number 4 oil by 2030. But the explosion on Thursday night could add new pressure to go further, phasing out fossil fuel use altogether and converting the stations to renewable sources.\n\n\u201cThis is a very old and very polluting power plant that should have been shut down quite a while ago,\u201d Judith Enck, the former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator for New York, told HuffPost late Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that New York needs to accelerate efforts to phase out fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images New York Police Department officers stand outside a Consolidated Edison plant in Astoria on Thursday night.\n\nStanding outside the gates of the Astoria Generating Station on Thursday night, state Sen.-elect Jessica Ramos, one of the insurgent Democrats who ousted a conservative incumbent in last month\u2019s election, vowed to co-sponsor the Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA) next year.\n\nThe bill, first introduced in the Assembly in 2016, mandates that New York switch to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. For two years, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority refused to vote on the bill even as it repeatedly passed in the Assembly, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry, declined to champion the legislation.\n\nBut Ramos, who last week attended a packed town hall in Jackson Heights to encourage Spanish-speaking voters to speak out about climate change and environmental issues, called the bill \u201ca huge priority\u201d for the new Democratic majority that \u201cwill definitely come up next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of these things happen in a vacuum,\u201d Ramos said as police vehicles and Consolidated Edison trucks sped past a crowd of TV crews. \u201cWe need to flip everything on its head and rethink the paradigm of exactly how it is that the city of New York and the state of New York is thinking about our future consumption of energy.\u201d\n\nThe CCPA is far from the only effort to stoke debate over New York\u2019s energy use and climate pollution. The push to shutter dirty power plants goes back years.\n\nIn 2011, officials closed the Charles Poletti Power Project, a three-decade-old plant in Astoria that was once considered the city\u2019s worst polluter. The Queens\u2019 Times-Ledger noted that it was \u201cthe prime reason western Queens ... was nicknamed Asthma Alley.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, city lawmakers introduced a landmark bill to cut emissions from buildings of more than 25,000 square feet, the city\u2019s biggest source of carbon pollution. The legislation would be the first of its kind in any major city, and would likely set a new standard for metropoles under pressure to reduce emissions as climate change worsens. The bill\u2019s proponents pitched it as a first step toward what they call a \u201cGreen New Deal for New York City\u201d \u2015 a nod to the national effort by progressives to pass sweeping economic and energy reforms and end fossil fuel use in the next decade.\n\nTwo weeks ago, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer announced a \u201csignificant next step\u201d in divesting the city\u2019s $200 billion pension funds of oil and gas as he issued a request for a proposal to analyze the city\u2019s fossil fuel risks.\n\nLast January, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration sued five major oil companies over infrastructure damage linked to sea level rise. A federal judge tossed the suit in July, but California and seven other states signed on to the city\u2019s appeal last month.\n\nThis is a very old and very polluting power plant that should have been shut down quite a while ago. Judith Enck, former regional EPA administrator\n\nNew York generates just 5 percent of its electricity from wind or solar. In a sweeping policy speech this month outlining a progressive third-term agenda, Cuomo pledged to move the state to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040. But despite his allusion to a Green New Deal, the Cuomo administration is still considering new pipeline projects that environmentalists say puts fragile ecosystems at risk and threatens to prolong the state\u2019s reliance on fracked gas from Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n\nFor Daniela Lapidous, a Brooklyn-based renewable energy activist who spent much of the past year bird-dogging Cuomo and urging him to back the CCPA, the transformer explosion on Thursday hit home. After seeing images of the electrical fire online, Lapidous began frantically texting friends in Queens.\n\n\u201cI was just so worried about everyone I know who lives nearby,\u201d Lapidous said by phone Thursday night. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be normal to fear that the way we provide energy endangers the people we love.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Richard Overton, Nation's Oldest World War II Veteran, Dead At 112", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nation-s-oldest-world-war-ii-vet-dies-in-texas-at-age-112_us_5c25ca28e4b08aaf7a8f09d0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Richard Overton, the nation\u2019s oldest World War II veteran who was also believed to be the oldest living man in the U.S., died Thursday in Texas, a family member said.

Residents in New York City and neighboring areas began posting photos of the dazzling scene online, showing a neon blue glow emanating from the northwestern corner of Long Island.\n\nReacting to photos of the brilliant display, social media users wondered if the explosion was an alien invasion or a source of superpowers.\n\nDeputy Inspector Benjamin Gurley of NYPD\u2019s 43rd Precinct quickly assured residents that there were no aliens involved in the incident, and the Fire Department of New York said in a tweet that the situation was under control.\n\nPower Surge at the ConEd facility in Astoria. pic.twitter.com/Iehisp2klj \u2014 NYCFireWire (@NYCFireWire) December 28, 2018\n\nWhen a utility employee pulled up in an SUV at 10:25 p.m. and asked one of the three NYPD officers at the entrance of the Astoria Generating Station if it was safe to go in, the officer nodded and waved the worker through the gate.\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d a 30-year-old man who said his name was Belkei and declined to give a last name told HuffPost.\n\nHe was standing nearby on 21st Street at 21st Avenue in the Ditmars Steinway neighborhood of New York City. \u201cI thought it was a plane crash.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Belkei O.

He persuaded House leaders to insert $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money into the short-term spending extension that the Senate had already passed unanimously. But not even a majority of the Senate voted for the revised version of that bill last week, let alone the 60 votes it would need for passage.\n\nBoth the House and Senate held brief procedural sessions Thursday, but almost no lawmakers were in town. Similar procedural sessions were set for Monday, New Year\u2019s Eve, but the most likely scenario seemed to be that the whole issue would be put off until Jan. 3, when the new Congress is seated with Democrats taking control of the House.\n\nNine Cabinet agencies, including the departments of homeland security, justice, state and interior, ran out of funding at midnight Dec. 21, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees uncertain if they would get scheduled paychecks in mid-January.\n\nIn a Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump said he would be \u201cproud to shut down the government for border security\u201d if Democrats refused to agree to billions of additional dollars for his wall. Ever since that point, though, Trump has reversed tactics and is blaming Democrats \u2015 even taking that message to U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fighting for borders in other countries, and they don\u2019t want to fight \u2015 the Democrats \u2015 for the border of our country.

Just How Dirty Is Marc Randazza?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-lawyer-marc-randazza_us_5c1c283ae4b08aaf7a86b9e4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "One morning this June, a group of lawyers filed into the office of the State Bar of Nevada and closed the door. It was summer in Las Vegas, the morning temperature already nearing 100 degrees, but inside the low-slung tan building, the lawyers had a chilly question to address: what to do about one of their own.\n\nMarc Randazza had been a problem for years.\n\nRandazza, who represents conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and many other far-right extremists, had long relied on lawyer buddies to pump his public image. By their telling and his own, Randazza was a First Amendment \u201cbadass.\u201d But he was a combative badass, even vicious, and he\u2019d left a trail of bad blood and trampled ethics behind him.\n\nRandazza had made enemies. Plenty of them. But he was cunning. He\u2019d sidestepped previous bar complaints and once avoided paying $600,000 in damages to his former employer by filing for bankruptcy and having his malpractice insurance kick in. Randazza was lucky, too. When an appeals court assigned a panel of judges to look into his misrepresentations in court under oath, the underlying case settled before the panel could meet. So off Randazza went, scuttling along through the Mojave as unaccountable as a scorpion.\n\nHis problems, though, now appeared to be gaining on him. For five years, the Nevada Bar had been aware of allegations that Randazza violated ethics rules in 2011 and 2012 while working for pornographers. By the time the lawyers met in Vegas to decide his fate, Randazza had attained a new level of notoriety.\n\nSince Donald Trump\u2019s election, he had become, as much as any attorney in America, a legal crowbar for far-right grifters and goons to leverage the protections of democracy in an effort to undermine them. And although Randazza had taken on legitimate free speech cases in the past, he\u2019d grown curiously chummy with fascists and racists who use defamation, harassment and threats to silence others.\n\nAside from Jones, Randazza and his firm represented neo-Nazi publisher Andrew Anglin; white nationalist Republican congressional candidate Paul Nehlen; white supremacist patriarch Jared Taylor; Holocaust-denying slanderer Chuck Johnson; Pizzagate peddler Mike Cernovich; pro-rape misogynist Daryush \u201cRoosh\u201d Valizadeh; an alt-right member who helped organize the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; the booking agent for white nationalist Richard Spencer; 8chan, an online message board teeming with neo-Nazis; and Gab, the alt-right social media platform where Robert Bowers, who allegedly killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in October, appears to have radicalized himself.\n\nIn Randazza, these extremists had found their own bush league Roy Cohn, the attorney who in a pre-internet era served as the \u201clegal executioner\u201d for right-wing thugs such as Trump and Joseph McCarthy and repped mafia bosses like Carmine \u201cLilo\u201d Galante and \u201cFat Tony\u201d Salerno. (Cohn was disbarred for \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation\u201d shortly before he died in 1986.)\n\nLike Cohn, Randazza was willing to go on the offensive for authoritarians. And like Cohn, Randazza\u2019s legal license and bunco man\u2019s talent for beguilement made him as problematic as some of the people he represented. This summer, a former federal judge who\u2019d scrutinized Randazza\u2019s unethical behavior in an arbitration proceeding described the attorney as nothing short of a danger to the public.\n\nCertainly, Randazza\u2019s misbehavior had happened in public \u2014 it was all there in the court records for anyone who cared to slog through them, a testament to how easily a bad actor with the right credentials can abuse a system that assumes candor from its professional class, not to mention an illustration of how white-collar privilege can abet white-collar wrongdoing in America. Like a Wall Street banker selling bad debt or a well-connected U.S. Supreme Court nominee fibbing under oath, Randazza had been given a pass. Until now.\n\nThe backstory to what he\u2019d done was complicated, the details sordid. The short of it is this: While working as the in-house general counsel for gay pornographers a few years ago, he solicited bribes, embraced conflicts of interest, relied on ill-gotten privileged information to gain a legal advantage, made misrepresentations about his fees to various courts and despoiled evidence of his treachery, according to an arbitrator\u2019s findings, sworn statements in legal proceedings, interviews with opposing counsel, Randazza\u2019s own admissions and thousands of pages of court records.\n\nBut what was the Nevada Bar prepared to do about it?\n\nA Troll Is Born\n\nTwenty-year-old Randazza enlisted in the U.S. Army during one hiatus from college with the goal of becoming a psychological operations soldier, according to military records obtained by HuffPost. He lasted less than five months in the Army. Randazza completed boot camp and airborne \u201cjump school\u201d training but appears to have washed out of psy-ops training and was discharged for undisclosed reasons during the Gulf War.\n\nHe returned to the University of Massachusetts and plunged into controversy. A school administrator at the time remembers Randazza as \u201can oppositional personality\u201d who was \u201cjust interested in burning stuff down.\u201d Randazza lived in Butterfield Hall, a dorm known for its drug-fueled parties, and took to flying a Jolly Roger flag from an antenna on the building\u2019s slate roof \u2015 an early, if misguided, free speech stand. Randazza, the former administrator said, egged on other students to climb on the steep roof. The school removed the flag several times because of safety concerns, only to have someone put it back up, at one point by allegedly using explosives to blast off metal bars the school had installed over windows to prevent students from accessing the roof. Randazza claimed the bars \u201crusted and fell out.\u201d\n\nWhen one female student complained that the flag resembled the logo of White Aryan Resistance, a prominent neo-Nazi organization, Randazza mocked her concerns and covered a letter she\u2019d written in crude sexual insults, according to the student newspaper. The insults, he said, were his \u201ctrademark.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Daily Collegian Randazza seemed to delight in antagonizing the UMass administration.\n\nIt took Randazza seven years to graduate from UMass with a journalism degree in 1994. After college, he drifted for a few years \u2014 a period he vaguely refers to as his time as a \u201cformer news reporter,\u201d although scant evidence of his journalism career exists. Randazza filed at least two dispatches from Italy, where he now has dual citizenship, for the newsletter of the Order Sons of Italy in America, a national organization for people of Italian heritage.\n\nIn 1997, Randazza managed to get into Georgetown law school; he said he finished a \u201cdead last\u201d in his class. He caused a furor when he ran for the Student Bar Association using campaign posters that referenced penile implants. When the Women\u2019s Legal Association tore down the posters, Randazza protested to the dean that his political speech was being censored. He got to put his posters back up. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Randazza gloated on one legal blog, \u201cthe WLA cow had to apologize to me.\u201d\n\nRandazza completed his third year of law school at the University of Florida because, as he put it, he never fit in at Georgetown: \u201cI found it to be too conformist and oppressive. I\u2019m a hardcore left-wing guy, but at Georgetown, there was no room to dissent.\u201d (Georgetown is a large law school that graduates students from all walks of life and political backgrounds. Among them: Atlantic Media owner David Bradley, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, House Majority Leader-elect Steny Hoyer, criminal Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and criminal Republican lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.)\n\nIn almost every interview, Randazza describes himself as a \u201cleftist\u201d or a \u201clibtard\u201d or \u201cso liberal\u201d that he\u2019s \u201cpractically a communist,\u201d which might have been accurate in 1996, when he listed his party affiliation as the Socialist Workers Party, according to Florida voter registration records. But it wasn\u2019t in 2000, when Randazza volunteered for John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign. Since at least 2002, Randazza has been a registered and active Republican voter, according to both Florida and Nevada records.\n\nHe went out of his way to take advantage of us. With him, there\u2019s always an end game that occurs at the expense of somebody else. And he has no remorse. Brian Dunlap, vice president of Liberty\u2019s sister company, Excelsior\n\nHe began his legal practice in earnest around that time and, with his bad grades, struggled at first to find a job. He claimed to shun the idea of working at a big firm because \u201cit\u2019s all about being a billing machine and ethics aren\u2019t important.\u201d Instead, his moral compass pointed to pornography, which he called \u201cone of the most ethical industries I have ever dealt with.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, he landed a junior position at a small firm that specialized in First Amendment and intellectual property cases. His career received an immediate and major boost when Fox News made him a talking head after an academic paper he wrote about online vote swapping garnered national attention. From the start, though, smut was Randazza\u2019s primary focus. In Florida, the porn lawyer tooled around in a yellow Porsche with U.S. paratrooper plates.\n\nIn 2009, he took a nearly $250,000-a-year job in San Diego as in-house general counsel for Excelsior Media, a gay porn company, and Excelsior\u2019s production and distribution arms Liberty Media Holdings and Corbin Fisher. (Because all of the cases Randazza worked on involve Liberty as a party, we will refer to his employer as Liberty throughout this article.) Liberty later relocated to Las Vegas, and Randazza moved with the company.\n\nOn his first attempt at passing the Nevada Bar exam, Randazza failed the ethics portion of the test.\n\nThe Porn Lawyer Ascendant\n\nRandazza staggered naked down the stairs, clutching a bottle of red wine. It was January 2010, and the attorney was boozing it up at the villa Liberty had rented for a location-scouting trip to Costa Rica. Around 9 a.m. that day, according to court records, Randazza stopped studying for the California Bar exam and started guzzling vodka and peach soda. He kept drinking over lunch at a nearby hillside restaurant, tossing back so many cocktails that he had to be helped outside to vomit in the parking lot. Brian Dunlap, vice president of Liberty\u2019s sister company, Excelsior, drove Randazza back to the villa in a rental Jeep, the vehicle bouncing over small cobblestone roads as Randazza puked violently out the window, his heaving taking on a staccato rhythm with the bumps.\n\nBack at the villa, Dunlap got the attorney into his bedroom and went to hose down the Jeep. But Randazza was soon back on his feet and making for the pool with a wine bottle. Now, he was naked. The Liberty executives looked on, laughing. One of them filmed the glassy-eyed Randazza wobbling into the pool.\n\n\u201cAs your attorney,\u201d Randazza said, turning full-frontal to the camera as he held his wine bottle aloft, \u201cI advise you to drink this.\u201d\n\nHuffPost image Marc Randazza getting drunk and naked on a trip to scout porn shoot locations in Costa Rica.\n\nInitially, Randazza\u2019s antics seemed harmlessly incorrigible. And his raffish demeanor was hardly out of place in the freewheeling porn industry. Randazza didn\u2019t just party with his bosses. He procured concealed carry permits for them, helped them with legal name changes and sorted out their messy personal affairs. On one occasion, he acted as a cooler after a Liberty performer who was in a sexual relationship with the company\u2019s CEO allegedly attacked the executive. Randazza bundled the porn actor into a cab bound for the airport and a flight out of Las Vegas.\n\n\u201c[Your] 702 area code privileges have been revoked,\u201d he told the man.\n\nAbove all, though, Randazza served as Liberty\u2019s attack dog. His main duty was to go after copyright infringers, earning a 25 percent bonus on any settlement funds he brought in. Some of the infringers were companies, but Randazza also shook down gay kids and small-time pirates, even unemployed ones.\n\nBut Randazza was two-timing Liberty. He was secretly doing work for Liberty competitors such as Bang Bros, Titan Media and Kink.com, sometimes billing his outside clients almost 100 hours a month. He also worked for companies accused of infringing Liberty\u2019s copyrights, including XVideos. Most attorneys would shun these conflicts of interest. Randazza barreled into them. He played clients off each other and cited \u201cfair use\u201d to dissuade Liberty from suing infringers.\n\n\u201cThe big targets that we kept asking him to go after for months were his clients,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWe kept saying, \u2018What about XVideos? What about XVideos? They\u2019re the worst.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnly years later did Liberty executives realize that when they sent takedown notices to XVideos, the lawyer handling them sat down the hall. Randazza invoiced XVideos for over $44,000 while employed by Liberty.\n\n\u201cHe went out of his way to take advantage of us,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWith him, there\u2019s always an end game that occurs at the expense of somebody else. And he has no remorse.\u201d\n\nRandazza misled people on multiple fronts. When he started his Liberty job, he accurately described himself in court as the \u201cin-house counsel for Liberty Media Holdings.\u201d But a year later, he was giving judges, journalists and potential clients the impression that he was an outside attorney, rather than a Liberty employee. He swapped out his Liberty email address and letterhead for a personal email address and the letterhead of the \u201cRandazza Legal Group,\u201d a firm he\u2019d set up in Florida. He handed out personal business cards that made no reference to his Liberty job.\n\nIn court filings, Randazza referred to himself as \u201ccounsel for Plaintiff\u201d or \u201can attorney for the Plaintiff.\u201d He told courts that Liberty had \u201cincurred\u201d his fees or that he\u2019d \u201ccharged\u201d the company at billing rates of $425 to $500 per hour. To support those rates, he sometimes filed affidavits from a paralegal who stated under oath that he was Liberty\u2019s \u201cVice President for Intellectual Property Management,\u201d a position Dunlap said the paralegal never held. Randazza also submitted affidavits from lawyer friends of his, along with time sheets showing his rates, even though he was a salaried employee.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why he did this. He may have thought it would make it easier for him to recover fees, which juiced his 25 percent bonus on settlement money and allowed him to hike up his rate ceiling. (He now charges some clients $700 per hour.)\n\nIn the U.S. legal system, each party typically pays its own legal bills. There are, however, provisions in some types of litigation \u2014 federal copyright cases, for example \u2014 that allow for the winning party to collect its fees from the losing party. Judges would probably scrutinize an in-house counsel\u2019s request to recover fees more closely, according to several ethics experts and law professors. But an in-house counsel has just as good a chance at recovering fees, the experts added \u2014 a fact Randazza might not have been aware of at the time.\n\n\u201cAll the stuff that is misleading is tailored for him to win that fee award,\u201d said Adam Springel, a Las Vegas attorney and expert in commercial and business law who examined a number of Randazza\u2019s fee filings at HuffPost\u2019s request. \u201cHe was clearly trying to get the judge to rubber-stamp his fee requests.\u201d\n\nBy creating the impression that he was an outside hired gun, Randazza may have also been trying to build name recognition and drum up business for the Randazza Legal Group, whose growth Liberty was subsidizing. Randazza didn\u2019t tell his employer about some of the fee awards he won \u2014 \u201cthe substantial ones, in particular,\u201d Dunlap said \u2014 and later refused to let Liberty audit the account where he deposited litigation payouts. He said it would look better in court to use the Randazza Legal Group on filings, as \u201cinsulation\u201d for his employers.\n\n\u201cWe took it as legal advice, and didn\u2019t think much of it at the time,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWe had no idea to what extent he was trying to double dip. ... But when we discovered he was trying to say he was an outside firm charging us hourly and running up huge legal bills, that\u2019s when it became apparent he was trying to pull a fast one with the court.\u201d\n\nGreedhead & Fleecer, LLP\n\nRandazza\u2019s dirty pool went beyond duping his employer and the courts. He was also soliciting illicit payoffs from parties that Liberty wanted him to sue. Records that surfaced during the arbitration proceeding and that were later made public in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Nevada reveal the grimy particulars. In December 2010, while negotiating a settlement for Liberty with the website TNAFlix, Randazza went after his first bribe. He wanted TNA to pay to \u201cconflict [him] out\u201d of being able to sue the website again. A $5,000 \u201ccontract\u201d figure came up. Randazza\u2019s opposing counsel, Val Gurvits, had no idea that Randazza was working in-house for Liberty at the time.\n\n\u201cNot a single communication from him ever came on Liberty letterhead,\u201d Gurvits told HuffPost.\n\nRandazza concealed his job while hunting for money from other companies. But he didn\u2019t hide his avarice.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a little gravy for me,\u201d he emailed Gurvits. \u201cAnd it has to be more than the $5K you were talking about before. I\u2019m looking at the cost of at least a new Carrera in retainer deposits after circulating around the adult entertainment expo this week. I\u2019m gonna want at least used BMW money.\u201d\n\nRandazza asked for $30,000 and raised the possibility of teaming up with Gurvits to broker a sale of TNA to one of Randazza\u2019s outside clients, which could have earned him a $375,000 commission. He pushed hard to secure both deals. When Gurvits hesitated, Randazza claimed another company wanted to hire him to sue TNA.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hold these guys back any longer,\u201d he warned.\n\nOwen Freeman for Huffpost Marc Randazza worked long hours chasing porn money, some of it illicit.\n\nRandazza\u2019s first known solicitation of a bribe was an apparent violation of the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct, which forbid lawyers from \u201coffering or making\u201d agreements like these that could restrict them from practicing law. (The Nevada rules mirror the model rules of the American Bar Association, a baseline version of which has been adopted in every jurisdiction except California.) Randazza later tried to wring a bribe out of Megaupload, a file-sharing site that had allegedly infringed Liberty\u2019s copyright, according to arbitration records.\n\n\u201cOnce you take a financial stake in the outcome of your client\u2019s case, then you have a conflict of interest. It compromises the independent professional judgment of the lawyer. It\u2019s not even a close call,\u201d said Russell McClain, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and an expert in professional responsibility.\n\nThe extent of Randazza\u2019s web of deception became apparent in Liberty\u2019s 2012 federal lawsuit against Oron, a file-sharing site. When Randazza tried to recover fees in the case, he not only failed to identify himself as Liberty\u2019s in-house counsel but also bundled his own \u201ccharged\u201d fees with the fees of outside attorneys he\u2019d brought on at his firm. He claimed the Randazza Legal Group had billed Liberty almost 366 hours, causing the porn company to \u201cincur\u201d $214,964 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Of that total, Randazza told the court, $90,833.98 resulted from his nearly 182 hours of work at $500 per hour.\n\nHe also reported that his employees billed Liberty at their \u201cstandard hourly rates.\u201d For his partner, Ronald Green, that meant $400 per hour. For paralegals, it was $125 per hour. In reality, the Randazza Legal Group gave Liberty a massive discount, sometimes 75 percent off market rates, on work done by its lawyers \u2014 a fact that Randazza withheld from the court.\n\nThese were material misrepresentations, according to multiple fee experts interviewed by HuffPost. And Randazza got away with them: U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro eventually ordered Oron to pay an extra $131,797.50 to cover Randazza\u2019s claimed fees.\n\nRandazza had crossed the line in other ways, too. While negotiating a $550,000 settlement agreement with Oron, he\u2019d chased another bribe. If the file-sharing company paid him $75,000, Randazza would \u201cnever be able to sue [Oron and its sister companies] forever and ever,\u201d he promised Oron\u2019s counsel. For that price, Randazza said he\u2019d \u201cprovide some really great value\u201d \u2014 including a \u201cplan that you\u2019ll drool over\u201d to make it harder for other companies like Liberty to sue Oron.\n\nRandazza had an unfair advantage. He\u2019d acquired information about Oron\u2019s privileged legal communications and its Hong Kong bank account from a softcore porn photographer named James Grady who also wanted to take down the file-sharing company. Grady had paid \u201ca guy \u2014 call him a forensic investigator \u2014 to dig past Domains by Proxy and things like that,\u201d the photographer told Randazza in an email, making it clear that his source \u201cdidn\u2019t get the info at Walmart in the course of normal commerce.\u201d\n\nAccording to Val Gurvits, whom Oron brought in to help with its case because of his experience dealing with Randazza, the only way to know about Oron\u2019s overseas bank account would be if someone \u201cbroke into Oron\u2019s gmail.\u201d\n\nIt certainly looked that way. Grady sent Randazza a receipt showing that Oron had released money from its PayPal account to its Hong Kong bank account. He sent information about the personal email account of Oron\u2019s owner.\n\nHe sent the owner\u2019s Skype call logs, which Grady said came from one of Oron\u2019s email accounts. He supplied Randazza with detailed descriptions of internal emails sent by Oron\u2019s lawyer. The intel helped Randazza get a temporary restraining order in Nevada federal court and freeze Oron\u2019s assets.\n\nRandazza invited Grady to Las Vegas to be a \u201cstar witness\u201d in the case, urging the photographer to be careful about what he might tell the judge about the Oron material. \u201cYou [need] to consider what happens if the judge wants to know where you got your information,\u201d Randazza wrote. \u201cAs far as I know, it was lawfully obtained. You certainly got it lawfully. If the source is a disgruntled Oron employee, great. Jilted lover, great. Hacker, problematic.\u201d\n\nRandazza was forbidden from collecting evidence this way. He also wasn\u2019t allowed to engage in \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,\u201d according to multiple ethics experts. In fact, state bars across the country have determined that it is wrong for a lawyer to fail to inform opposing counsel about inadvertently received privileged material. The mere act of reading such material is unethical.\n\n\u201cWe would file a brief, and they would have a response the next day,\u201d said Stevan Lieberman, one of Oron\u2019s lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that [Randazza] used the privileged attorney-client communications to his advantage.\u201d\n\nRandazza also shared his \u201centire Oron file\u201d with one of his porn attorney friends, telling a paralegal to let the attorney \u201clift anything he wants,\u201d according to internal Randazza Legal Group emails. That attorney, who\u2019d later become a partner at Randazza\u2019s firm, and a different company would soon file a copycat suit in California that ratcheted up pressure on Oron and kept the company\u2019s assets frozen.\n\nIn a bind, Gurvits agreed to pay Randazza the $75,000 but insisted that the payment be part of the settlement agreement between Liberty and Oron. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me insisting, we would have had a separate agreement,\u201d Gurvits told HuffPost. \u201cBut I felt that was improper. That\u2019s how Randazza offered to do it. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do an end-run around your client.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how Randazza got caught.\n\nAn Unhappy Ending\n\nWhen his boss at Liberty, Jason Gibson, thumbed through a draft of the proposed settlement with Oron, he spotted a curious one-line item for $75,000: Randazza\u2019s gravy.\n\n\u201cMy stomach is churning after reading the proposed agreement,\u201d he emailed Randazza.\n\nTheir relationship quickly unraveled. Within days, Randazza left his job. He and a paralegal covered their tracks by repeatedly running data-wiping software on their company computers that prevented Liberty from recovering evidence, according to court documents and forensic investigator testimony. He refused to release the $550,000 Oron settlement award to Liberty from his trust account.\n\nRandazza laid siege to the company.\n\n\u201cMurum aries attigit\u201d is a war doctrine attributed to Julius Caesar that translates to \u201cthe [battering] ram has touched the wall.\u201d The phrase has a baleful meaning: If your enemies refuse to surrender before hostilities commence, destroy them without mercy. This is Randazza\u2019s motto as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cOnce the ram touches the wall, you have to commit to ending the other party as a going concern,\u201d he explained on his blog. \u201cYou must leave the other party with nothing left with which to fight. Because, if a party is fool enough to refuse the favorable terms, that party is fool enough (and poorly advised enough) to keep being a pain in your ass until you finally put them down like a diseased animal.\u201d\n\nRandazza filed a complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, alleging that he\u2019d been sexually harassed at work as a straight man because Liberty, which mainly makes gay porn, once filmed a sex scene \u2015 a straight scene, it turned out \u2015 in his office. It was a peculiar claim. In the Liberty workplace, Randazza had been exuberantly lewd. He\u2019d talked about wanting to \u201csnap a nasty metal bar across [a man\u2019s] wiener\u201d and purchased a couch used for porn shoots for his home, then emailed around a picture of his scantily clad wife posing on it. But the free speech crusader who called political correctness a \u201cdisease\u201d and casually, if jokingly, threw around words like \u201cnigger\u201d and \u201ccunt\u201d now was saying he\u2019d suffered ethnic harassment as an Italian-American because Liberty executives had sarcastically called him a \u201cguinea\u201d and a \u201cwop,\u201d usually in response to his own off-color instigations.\n\nRandazza\u2019s harassment complaint was an obvious farce, and it went nowhere.\n\nHuffPost image Randazza would bring all his legal firepower to bear in trying to destroy his former client.\n\nIn December 2012, he sued Liberty\u2019s parent company in Nevada state court on allegations of fraud, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Four months later, Liberty filed a complaint against Randazza with the Nevada Bar, reporting his solicitation of bribes, conflicts of interest, misleading fee motions and warning that Randazza had on multiple occasions threatened to \u201cdrown anyone who attempts to challenge him in legal bills and debt.\u201d But the bar dismissed the complaint, citing the ongoing state lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe bar\u2019s approach was like, \u2018Hey, we can\u2019t really do anything because there\u2019s a civil matter going on now,\u2019\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cBut that policy is what allows people to get away with this because private citizens have to assume the burden and the expense of having to prove all this themselves. That means Randazza can drown us in legal fees, which is what he tried to do. It\u2019s a process that can be manipulated because if you have a grievance with an attorney, all the attorney has to do is sue you.\u201d\n\nEven when Liberty found a way to hold Randazza accountable, the attorney wriggled away. Not long after Randazza sued Liberty, the porn company reported his self-dealing in his fee recovery efforts to an appeals court where the dispute between Oron and Liberty was still playing out. The appeals court asked a panel of judges to look into Randazza\u2019s fees, but Liberty and Oron settled their differences and the case was dismissed before the panel could meet. Unfortunately for Oron, the copycat suit that Randazza helped his friend bring against the file-sharing firm kept Oron\u2019s assets on ice. Unable to pay its hosting provider, Oron went out of business, according to the company\u2019s statements in court filings.\n\nRandazza, on the other hand, stayed in business. And he wasn\u2019t done with Liberty. Not long after he left the company, he crossed paths with Dunlap at a porn conference in Arizona and invited his former co-worker to step outside and fight.\n\n\u201cI wonder how much it would cost me to punch you in the face right now,\u201d Randazza said, according to sworn testimony by Dunlap in a subsequent legal dispute.\n\nRandazza\u2019s next move was to file an arbitration claim against the porn company in which he claimed wrongful termination, breach of contract, back pay and damages from the sexual and ethnic harassment Randazza said he\u2019d suffered. He demanded over $4 million in damages.\n\nThe arbitration dragged on for three years and cost Liberty over $1 million. But it backfired spectacularly on Randazza. Liberty brought counterclaims for, among other things, legal malpractice and unjust enrichment. The evidence quickly piled up against Randazza. Billing records proved he\u2019d been getting paid by XVideos every month. Many of the damning emails he thought he\u2019d destroyed were produced and showed him soliciting bribes. Under oath, one of his own expert witnesses was forced to concede that Randazza had likely misled him and violated ethical rules.\n\nRandazza tried to explain away the bribes as a ruse to squeeze extra money for Liberty out of infringers. He\u2019d described his dishonesty in one court filing as \u201cmere puffery.\u201d\n\nHuffPost image/arbitration records In emails to opposing counsel that later surfaced during arbitration, Randazza brazenly pursued bribes to conflict himself out of future litigation.\n\nHis battering ram had splintered. During arbitration hearings, the normally cocksure Randazza wouldn\u2019t even look at Liberty\u2019s attorney, Wendy Krincek. He turned his seat away from the arbitration table and put his back to his own attorney, Ken White, a longtime Randazza confederate who runs the Popehat legal blog. Randazza also refused to look at the arbitrator, a former federal judge and assistant Watergate special prosecutor. Instead, the attorney stared at the floor, his body hunched over, hand pressed to the side of his face as he answered Krincek\u2019s questions.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie to opposing counsel, would you?\u201d Krincek asked Randazza during one hearing while confronting him over a misrepresentation about his fees.\n\n\u201cYes, I would,\u201d Randazza replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d Krincek said. \u201cHe\u2019s a litigator. He knows how to present as a witness. He was physically incapable of doing that. \u2026 It was a tell that he was uncomfortable answering the questions. He\u2019s a smart guy and he\u2019s pretty charismatic. I think he can generally talk his way out of anything, but he was getting nowhere.\u201d\n\nRandazza was so rattled after the hearing that he appeared to stick a large wad of used chewing gum on the rear window of Krincek\u2019s Saab station wagon in the parking lot, according to Dunlap. (Randazza denied being the gum-sticker.)\n\nIn June 2015, the arbitrator ruled against Randazza on every point, finding that the attorney had \u201cbeen involved in and successfully concluded negotiations for a bribe,\u201d among a litany of other wrongdoing. The arbitrator ordered Randazza to pay Liberty more than $600,000 in damages.\n\nBut Randazza had one more card to play. Claiming to be almost $14 million in debt, he filed for bankruptcy and froze the arbitration award. A few months earlier, he\u2019d taken steps to shield many of his assets by moving them into college funds for his children, transferring his BMW and his 80 percent share of his legal practice into a \u201cself-settled spendthrift\u201d trust and lending $300,000 to his in-laws for them to buy a property in Las Vegas, according to Clark County public records. Oddly, the loan came at a time when Randazza\u2019s marriage was falling apart. About two weeks after the arbitration ruling, his wife filed for divorce.\n\n\u201cConceptually, it\u2019s not OK to do all sorts of pre-bankruptcy planning and move your assets around,\u201d said Bob Keach, one of the country\u2019s top bankruptcy lawyers. \u201cThis is clearly a guy who has spent some time playing the system.\u201d\n\nBut the U.S. trustee overseeing Randazza\u2019s bankruptcy \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to care\u201d when the issue was raised at a creditors\u2019 meeting, according to Dunlap.\n\nNow, it was Liberty\u2019s turn to go on the offensive. With the arbitration decision in hand and binders of evidence proving its case, Liberty filed a second complaint against Randazza with the Nevada Bar. This time, the bar moved forward.\n\nPublicly, Randazza blasted the arbitration as a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d but the arbitrator\u2019s determinations became the bedrock of the disciplinary proceeding against him. In private, Randazza worried. Liberty had also filed bar complaints against him in Florida, California, Arizona and Massachusetts \u2014 every other jurisdiction that licenses him \u2015 and Randazza quietly made the porn company an unusual offer: He\u2019d pay Liberty $20,000 for each of his bar licenses that wasn\u2019t suspended or revoked. He was, in other words, proposing a bribe.\n\n\u201cHe offered us a bounty on his bar licenses \u2015 we\u2019d get more of the award if we did not cooperate with bar investigators or send follow-up complaints,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cWe refused this offer because it was insulting [and] unethical.\u201d\n\nOnly in Florida did Randazza fail to offer a bounty \u2014 he felt he\u2019d be suspended or disbarred there anyway, according to an email his legal team sent Liberty. Randazza had already made misrepresentations in a letter to The Florida Bar about the Oron bribe and his work for XVideos. When he was busted for them during arbitration, he blamed one of his lawyers for making an \u201cinaccurate\u201d statement in the letter. (The Florida Bar declined to pursue its own investigation.)\n\nAnd Liberty wasn\u2019t the only party upset with Randazza in Florida. In federal court there, Paul Berger, Randazza\u2019s opposing counsel in an unrelated case, submitted a copy of a bar complaint he said he\u2019d filed against Randazza over a 2015 episode in which Randazza screamed curses at Berger and his client after a mediation session. Randazza threatened to assault them both and send the client, who happened to be Jewish, to the Gaza Strip, according to Berger\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Mr. Randazza knows no ethical boundaries,\u201d Berger told The Florida Bar, which apparently either declined to pursue an investigation or found nothing in Berger\u2019s complaint that merited disciplinary action. Pursuant to its policy, the bar then deleted all records of the complaint and, when contacted by HuffPost, was unable to acknowledge the document\u2019s prior existence.\n\nIn June 2016, Randazza settled his state lawsuit in Nevada against Liberty. He\u2019d been the one to sue, but now his malpractice insurer was the one to pay, shelling out $205,000 to make a counterclaim Liberty filed against Randazza for malpractice go away.\n\nIn February of this year, Randazza settled in bankruptcy court with Liberty, where the porn company had also filed a claim. This time, Randazza paid only $40,000. After nearly six years of grueling lawfare, he\u2019d managed to dodge almost all the damages from the arbitration award, which the parties agreed to vacate as part of the bankruptcy settlement.\n\nVacating the award did not sit well with the arbitrator, who warned in a court filing this July that an \u201cattempted erasure\u201d of his findings might conceal Randazza\u2019s \u201cproven serious ethical violations\u201d and weaken protections for \u201cfuture victims and the public.\u201d\n\nThe former judge was right to worry.\n\nNazi Punks, Jump In\n\nRandazza has scrubbed his Liberty job from his resume. The attorney-to-the-trolls now spends most of his days wringing his hands over the \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d as he tries to game the system for racists and fascists \u2015 as if Nazism deserves another spin through the public square.\n\nThe number of people \"affected\" by Naziism since 1945 is probably less than the number of people who have been crushed by vending machines. The philosophy lost in the marketplace of ideas until recently, where those who try to suppress it are driving new recruits to it in droves \u2014 Marc J. Randazza (@marcorandazza) May 14, 2018\n\nHe openly lauds the \u201calt-right\u201d movement:\n\nYes. The Right used to act that way. Those who are sometimes called \u201calt right\u201d are some of the most open and accepting of diverse views people I\u2019ve met in politics. \u2014 Marc J. Randazza (@marcorandazza) January 24, 2018\n\nHis reputation as a First Amendment attorney has frayed. Even his capstone free speech victory in 2011 over Righthaven, a copyright troll, carries a hoggish taint in hindsight. At the time, Randazza was employed by Liberty, which permitted him, pending the company\u2019s approval, to take on pro bono free speech cases to offset any bad press from Liberty\u2019s own copyright enforcement lawsuits. But Randazza concealed his work on Righthaven from his employer and kept a $60,000 payout \u2014 money Liberty only found out about during arbitration.\n\n\u201cMr. Randazza was unjustly enriched,\u201d wrote the arbitrator, who ruled that the payout should have gone to Liberty.\n\nIf you want to represent detestable clients, fine. But when you go out into the media and don\u2019t just defend them but actually adopt their logic and moral arguments, that\u2019s different. Then, it looks like you agree with them. Elie Mystal, executive editor of the Above the Law blog\n\nSome of Randazza\u2019s troubles are behind him \u2014 in June, he settled another malpractice claim brought by a former client for $50,000 \u2014 but others lie ahead. He remains in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and had only $15,652 in two bank accounts at the end of October, according to court records. In the sloppy monthly reports he is required to file with the bankruptcy court, he lists a sad series of expenses that include his daily coffee at Caffe Sicilia in Gloucester, shopping sprees at Men\u2019s Wearhouse and over $4,000 per month in payments to cover alimony to his ex-wife and and child support for their two children.\n\n\u201cI suspect that after the Liberty fiasco, his clients disappeared,\u201d Gurvits said. \u201cHe was riding high, he was really well-known, and then all of a sudden \u2014 disgrace. So who\u2019s going to hire him now?\u201d\n\nThe answer is the disgraced. Lawyers trying to make their bones as free speech attorneys often take on one extremist client. Maybe two. Randazza has assembled a panzer squad of them, a career choice that is generating new problems for him. When he signed on this year to represent the Satanic Temple in a complaint against Twitter, dozens of members of the organization revolted, describing Randazza as an \u201cagent of the alt-right\u201d and an \u201cally to Nazis.\u201d\n\nThey aren\u2019t wrong. In January, he partied with rape apologist Mike Cernovich and Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, a fascist gang that commits political violence throughout the country. Other pro-Trump racists and \u201cfree speech advocates\u201d were there, yukking it up about \u201cbrown people\u201d and \u201cfaggots\u201d and the genitalia of transgender women. Randazza also appears routinely on Infowars to lend a legal imprimatur to the lies of hate-spewing, violence-stoking propagandist Alex Jones. In an August appearance, Randazza likened Jones, a key gateway to white nationalism, to black civil rights leaders in the South during the 1960s.\n\nHuffPost image Randazza advocates for far-right extremists outside the courtroom as well as inside.\n\n\u201cIf you want to represent detestable clients, fine,\u201d Elie Mystal, the executive editor of the Above the Law blog, wrote in a recent column about Randazza. \u201cBut when you go out into the media and don\u2019t just defend them but actually adopt their logic and moral arguments, that\u2019s different. Then, it looks like you agree with them. And if you agree with them, you can no longer avail yourself of the lawyerly presumption that you are just doing your job. Instead of being a mere part of the process, you become part of the problem.\u201d\n\nRandazza has gone into business with at least one of his extremist clients, having co-produced both of Cernovich\u2019s films. The most recent one, \u201cHoaxed,\u201d is a propaganda reel that appears to demonize the free press and relies on figures such as Jones and Stefan Molyneux, another important conduit to white nationalism.\n\nIn a Daily Beast profile, Randazza described the Vladimir Putin-loving, Pizzagate-pushing Cernovich as \u201can A-plus level friend, and the kind of rare soul now where you can really trust his word as his bond.\u201d\n\nAnd Randazza doesn\u2019t just play defense for Cernovich and his other far-right pals. Unlike most First Amendment lawyers, he\u2019s willing to brandish the plaintiff\u2019s knives for them and carve out space in the legal system for their political agenda.\n\nSince 2016, for example, Randazza and the Holocaust-denying MAGA troll Chuck Johnson have been trying to scavenge coins off the corpse of Gawker after libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel sued the publication into bankruptcy \u2014 a legal outcome widely celebrated by fascists that has had a chilling effect on press freedom. Of Gawker and its former CEO, Nick Denton, Johnson said, \u201cIn a just world, I\u2019d have them killed. But we are not there yet.\u201d\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, Randazza represented professional misogynist and rape advocate Daryush Valizadeh in an attempt to sue one of Valizadeh\u2019s alleged victims. She lives in Iceland and told her story of sexual assault to Jane Gari, a book author and blogger. Gari gave the alleged victim a pseudonym and published her account of Valizadeh following the woman home, talking his way into her apartment with the pretext of using the bathroom \u2014 a ruse another woman who has accused Valizadeh of sexual assault told HuffPost he has used for at least a decade \u2014 then raping her. Valizadeh had written a guidebook to having sex with women years before in which he described a similar encounter:\n\nWhile walking to my place, I realized how drunk she was. In America, having sex with her would have been rape, since she couldn\u2019t legally give her consent. \u2026 I can\u2019t say I cared or even hesitated.\n\nRandazza apparently didn\u2019t care either. He sent a letter to Gari, who has written a book about being sexually abused as a child, and accused her of fabricating the rape account and \u201ccausing harm\u201d to \u201creal victims\u201d of sexual assault. He demanded she take down the post and confess on her blog.\n\n\u201cSimply admit that you lied, and all can be forgiven,\u201d Randazza wrote.\n\nWhen Gari refused, Randazza subpoenaed her in South Carolina federal court in an effort to get the alleged victim\u2019s name for Valizadeh, whose followers were already menacing Gari.\n\n\u201cListen you dumb cunt, you hideous skank,\u201d one Valizadeh fan emailed her, \u201cmaking false rape accusations is a great disservice against real victims of sex assaults, you attention seeking lowly cunt.\u201d\n\nThe case was an about-face from Randazza\u2019s earlier work defending small bloggers. Now he was looking to pierce South Carolina\u2019s shield law for reporters and muscle a sex abuse survivor on behalf of his pro-rape client. But Gari managed to fend off Valizadeh and Randazza in court and protect her source. When the judge granted her the right to depose Valizadeh and examine his claim that he\u2019d been defamed, Randazza moved to dismiss the case. His own case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a true First Amendment advocate would have taken this case,\u201d said Wallace Lightsey, Gari\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe saw it as an attempt to find the source so the source could be harassed.\u201d\n\nRandazza has been equally unscrupulous in his lawyering for Paul Nehlen, Alex Jones and others. When Chuck Johnson was sued for defamation earlier this year after smearing the wrong man as the driver of the car that killed Heather Heyer in Charlottesville last summer, Randazza told a Michigan court that Johnson had simply repurposed information from 4chan \u2015 a website Randazza described as a \u201cwire service\u201d and a \u201creliable source.\u201d But 4chan\u2019s /pol/ forum, where the libel circulated, is neither a wire service nor a reliable source. It is a place where neo-Nazis congregate to spread hate and disinformation.\n\nBut nothing compares to Randazza\u2019s advocacy for neo-Nazi Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin, who is being sued in Montana by Tanya Gersh, a Jewish woman Anglin targeted in a vicious anti-Semitic harassment campaign he launched from his site.\n\n\u201cFuck Nazis, but fuck Tanya Gersh too,\u201d Randazza tweeted while neo-Nazis were threatening Gersh\u2019s life. Anglin soon hired Randazza, paying him out of a more than $155,000 legal defense fund raised by Johnson, who took a 15 percent cut, the scum forming a closed loop.\n\nIn court, Randazza has played childish games about Anglin\u2019s location and sinister ones by advancing Holocaust denial as a legal defense. While trying to reduce the case to a debate in the \u201cmarketplace of ideas,\u201d Randazza essentially has argued that a neo-Nazi\u2019s call to action to terrorize a Jewish woman and her family is protected speech, a position one local paper called a \u201cdesperate attempt by a lawyer who should have a better understanding of the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn November, a judge shot down Randazza\u2019s argument and allowed the case to move forward, finding that Anglin \u201cdrew heavily on his readers\u2019 hatred and fear of ethnic Jews\u201d to incite them to harass Gersh.\n\nEven a free speech absolutist might struggle to defend some of Anglin\u2019s rhetoric. The neo-Nazi has said he \u201cwould absolutely and unequivocally endorse\u201d violence to achieve his goals, and Daily Stormer fans \u2014 including Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 have committed at least a dozen racist or politically motivated murders since 2015. In October, Anglin cheered the stabbing of a reporter in Germany by neo-Nazi youths, writing:\n\nJournalists deserve to fucking die. Every last one of them deserves to be rounded up, lined up and shot execution style and tossed in a mass grave. ... It makes me warm and fuzzy inside to know that journalists are seeing this story and wondering if they\u2019ll be next.\n\nRandazza has increasingly shown himself susceptible to fledgling far-right views. He openly agrees, for example, with Trump\u2019s description of the press as Americans\u2019 \u201cenemy.\u201d Earlier this year, Randazza tried to intimidate a reporter and his publication over a harmless tweet that vexed Cernovich. On Twitter, Randazza proclaimed his willingness to support the white nationalist Faith Goldy in her Toronto mayoral campaign. He promoted a white nationalist lie about the Democratic Party deploying anti-fascists as its foot soldiers. (Antifa almost universally despise the Democratic Party.)\n\nHe also tweeted this:\n\nTrump said he is a \"nationalist.\"\n\n\n\nAs far as I am concerned, being a nationalist is a bona fide job requirement for a U.S. President, Senator, Representative, Judge, all the way down to the lowest federal employee. pic.twitter.com/yn2xnKikJf \u2014 Marc J. Randazza (@marcorandazza) October 25, 2018\n\nThe difference between patriotism (love of country) and nationalism (blind devotion to country, usually with a chauvinistic assertion of superiority) should be obvious to a lawyer who represents nationalists. And as someone who represents white nationalists, Randazza would know that in the U.S. the word \u201cnationalism\u201d is linked to a violent and racist anti-democratic ideology.\n\nHe just doesn\u2019t care.\n\nThrone Of Lies\n\nThe rise of Trump has brought a common arc of radicalization on the political right into sharper relief \u2015 that of the contrarian troll who gets lost in his provocations and mutates into something dangerous. Just as some snarky libertarians turned into neo-Nazis and Tucker Carlson was a conservative snot before morphing into a megaphone for white nationalist talking points, Randazza, too, appears to have transformed on his trollish journey through the legal system.\n\nAnd like Carlson, who gets to spout hate on Fox News because he\u2019s a millionaire who once wore a bowtie on CNN, Randazza benefits from the trappings of privilege. His Georgetown law degree and admission to five state bars offer him what people targeted by his clients rarely receive: the benefit of the doubt. Consider a recent front-page Wall Street Journal story that focused on Gab and quoted Randazza as a First Amendment expert. Incredibly, the story failed to mention that Randazza has served as Gab\u2019s attorney. Consider, too, that Fox News, CNN, Vice News and others have credulously given Randazza a platform to polish his brand.\n\nBut his own profession has shown the least skepticism. Less than a week after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the journal of the American Bar Association ran a short column by Randazza lamenting how easy it is for \u201cvindictive lying women\u201d to ruin the lives of innocent men. Randazza neglected to tell his ABA editors he\u2019d already run the column on a right-wing legal blog. He also failed to offer any proof for his claim in the column that he currently represents (\u201cat a deep discount\u201d) multiple women who have survived sexual assault.\n\nHe did, however, have a message for sexual assault victims.\n\n\u201cI believe in their right to tell their story without being sued for it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLast year, Randazza was suing a woman for telling her story about being raped.\n\nRandazza gets away with those sorts of moves because many people assume basic honesty from lawyers. The legal system does too.\n\n\u201cIt would take too much time and energy to second-guess and check up on everybody all the time,\u201d said Bernie Burk, a legal ethics expert and former professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. \u201cGenerally speaking, if you\u2019re reasonably clever and selective about your dishonesty, you can get away with a great deal before the system catches you.\u201d\n\nRandazza\u2019s duplicity, whether clever or selective, has been constant. Even in recent cases that do not involve porn or Nazis, he has made a mockery of the truth. In Utah federal court, he was \u2014 until a few weeks ago \u2014 defending a man named Ryan Monahan who ran a website called Honest Mattress Reviews and had been sued by Purple, a mattress manufacturer, after Monahan allegedly lied on his site about Purple\u2019s products being covered with a cancer-causing white powder. Purple declared that Monahan had a business relationship with one of its main competitors, GhostBed.\n\nIn court, Randazza adamantly argued that Monahan was \u201can independent journalist\u201d entitled to full protection under the First Amendment. He dismissed the GhostBed connection as a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that \u201ceven Alexander Dumas could not have imagined when he wrote the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy turned out to be real. A witness came forward with evidence proving that Monahan \u201ceffectively acted as [GhostBed\u2019s] head of marketing\u201d and was being paid $10,000 a month by GhostBed. Randazza and Monahan had misled both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit and, repeatedly, the Utah federal court.\n\n\u201cInterference with the judicial process here was substantial,\u201d U.S. District Judge Dee Benson wrote, adding that Monahan\u2019s violations were \u201csufficiently egregious that perjury prosecutions would, and perhaps should be, an appropriate consideration.\u201d\n\nIn February, Benson ordered sanctions be imposed on Monahan and his business, Honest Reviews LLC. A few weeks later, Monahan sold his website to Brooklyn Bedding, another mattress company, and had it wire the money directly to Randazza to pay Monahan\u2019s \u201clegal debt.\u201d In July, Benson awarded Purple approximately $92,000 in sanctions from Monahan. When Purple\u2019s lawyers contacted Randazza to collect, he told them Monahan didn\u2019t have the money. Randazza had drained his client dry.\n\n\u201cSo do what you gotta do,\u201d he told Purple\u2019s lawyers.\n\nA desperate Monahan sent a letter to the judge saying he wanted to settle with Purple. Randazza then filed a motion to withdraw from the case \u201cas a matter of professional ethics,\u201d leaving Monahan to scramble to find replacement counsel.\n\n\u201cEverything that has exploded in this thing has been because of what [Randazza] has done,\u201d Monahan told HuffPost.\n\nYet Monahan, who said he has a limited grasp of the law, is the one on the hook for sanctions. He is the only one whom the judge suggested should face perjury charges, despite the judge\u2019s ruling that Randazza had also \u201cvigorously asserted\u201d misrepresentations in court.\n\n\u201cYou know what I like about my life?\u201d Randazza once told a legal blog. \u201cThere\u2019s not a motherfucker in this world who ever says, \u2018I\u2019m ambivalent about Marc Randazza.\u2019 That is what scares me \u2026 people being ambivalent about me.\u201d\n\nOwen Freeman for Huffpost Where Randazza winds up next on his journey through the sewers of the legal system is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cI did not get where I am by having a reputation for being someone who would stab others in the back,\u201d he once said.\n\nLowering The Bar\n\nRandazza had escaped sanctions in Utah. But in Nevada, his long disciplinary proceeding was nearing its end. It had been half a decade since Liberty alerted the Nevada Bar to Randazza\u2019s misbehavior. The porn company had given the bar thousands of pages of evidence about its former in-house counsel\u2019s conflicts of interest and solicitation of bribes, his misrepresentations about fees and use of privileged and confidential material.\n\nThe bar treats multiple offenses and a \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d as aggravating circumstances that can justify harsher discipline, so Dunlap, the Excelsior vice president who wrote the company\u2019s bar complaints, made a deliberate point of including that phrase. \u201cWe felt that would be the kicker, that once they had seen that that pattern had been demonstrated that it would leave no room for being wishy-washy or letting him off easy,\u201d Dunlap said.\n\nRandazza, in an effort to hang on to his law license, conceded as little as possible. He submitted a conditional guilty plea to the bar confessing to two of the nine ethical violations the bar alleged that he\u2019d committed. The first forbids certain conflicts of interest and concerned a shady loan Randazza made Liberty; the second prohibits a lawyer from restricting his right to practice and was related to the Oron bribe.\n\nIn exchange for this plea, Randazza asked the bar for a stayed suspension and probation \u2014 a slap on the wrist. But the bar was under no obligation to give it to him. The baseline sanction for the violations Randazza admitted is suspension.\n\nOn Oct. 10, the order came down in Nevada Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe hereby suspend Marc J. Randazza for 12 months, stayed for 18 months,\u201d it read.\n\nThat was Randazza\u2019s punishment: a stayed suspension and probation, plus a small fine and 20 hours of education in legal ethics. He will avoid actual suspension if he \u201cstays out of trouble\u201d during his probation, according to the order.\n\nThe system had finally caught him. And the system didn\u2019t seem to much care. The bar didn\u2019t pursue Randazza\u2019s solicitation of other bribes or his other conflicts of interest. Nor did it investigate whether Randazza despoiled evidence, lied to courts in fee motions or used privileged information that might have been obtained illegally.\n\nWhat the bar did find were \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d to allow for lighter punishment. Randazza, for instance, had no prior discipline in Nevada. Another factor was the \u201ctime delay\u201d between his ethical violations and the disciplinary hearing \u2014 a delay the bar helped cause by dismissing Liberty\u2019s initial complaint.\n\n\u201cWe had \u2026 to essentially lay out everything for the [Nevada] Bar and then once we handed it to them on a silver platter, they weren\u2019t willing to go the distance,\u201d Dunlap said.\n\nHere was Randazza\u2019s privileged white-collar tribe, policing itself, barely, behind closed doors. The bar refused multiple requests to discuss the Randazza matter or its own arcane rules. For two months, the bar also rebuffed HuffPost\u2019s attempts to view records of Randazza\u2019s disciplinary proceeding, despite their high public-interest value. At one point, a lawyer for the bar insisted the records were confidential and could only be obtained through a subpoena or a court order \u2014 a stance that clashed with that of the Nevada Supreme Court. When asked for the bar\u2019s policy on sealing disciplinary records, the lawyer insisted it was an \u201cinternal\u201d and unpublished policy. The next day, he said the bar was \u201cimplementing a new policy\u201d and handed over the records.\n\nAmong them is a transcript of the June hearing when the bar accepted Randazza\u2019s guilty plea. During the hearing, Matthew Carlyon, another bar lawyer, applauded Randazza for reforming his conduct and cited as evidence of the metamorphosis several phone calls Randazza had placed to the bar\u2019s ethics hotline seeking advice.\n\n\u201cHe is showing that he\u2019s willing to change and not be out there endangering the public,\u201d Carlyon said. \u201cThat\u2019s important because \u2026 ultimately our job here is to provide protection to the public. We\u2019re not here to discipline attorneys. That\u2019s not why we exist. We want to protect the public.\u201d\n\nSince then, Randazza has stayed true to form. In Montana federal court, he disobeyed rules requiring him to keep the court informed about his disciplinary proceedings. The judge, clearly upset, ordered Randazza in November to update the court. When Randazza did, he mentioned his stayed suspension but said nothing about his probation, despite describing it in detail to several other federal courts.\n\nRandazza may soon face \u201creciprocal discipline\u201d in other states where he is licensed. Following his discipline in Nevada, the bars in Arizona, California and Florida have opened or will open their own reviews of his ethical violations. But other bars tend to follow the example of the lead organization, and it is unclear if these states will probe more deeply.\n\nIn a disciplinary proceeding against Randazza in Massachusetts federal court, he has shown no remorse for his sleazy behavior and has already distorted reality in an attempt to avoid a suspension. In one filing, he blamed Oron for his solicitation of a bribe. He also audaciously told the court he didn\u2019t \u201ccause his clients to suffer any actual harm or financial losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt every step of the way, that has proven to be untrue,\u201d Dunlap countered.\n\nRandazza pilfered the $60,000 Righthaven settlement from Liberty, according to the arbitrator\u2019s ruling. He caused Liberty to possibly miss out on another settlement by not pursuing XVideos, one of his secret clients, for copyright infringement. Randazza also violated the terms of the $550,000 settlement he\u2019d negotiated with Oron \u2014 most significantly by helping his friend file a copycat suit \u2014 causing Liberty to pay back $275,000 of the award.\n\nThis week, however, the Massachusetts court let Randazza off the hook. The court declined to put the rogue attorney on probation and deferred a decision about further reciprocal discipline until his Nevada probation ends in April 2020. At that point, it\u2019s unclear what further discipline the court could even impose, especially if Randazza stays out of new trouble. And, so, the lawyer of choice for far-right extremists will continue to lawyer, at least for now \u2015 an example not so much of what America prohibits these days but rather what it permits, provided you belong to the right caste.\n\nWhen reached by email, Randazza refused to comment for this story. He referred HuffPost to his attorney, who also did not comment. Randazza\u2019s attorney, it turned out, was his expert witness from the Liberty arbitration \u2014 the one forced under oath to essentially acknowledge Randazza\u2019s dishonesty. Last year, the same attorney submitted an affidavit supporting a Randazza fee motion and, on an attached resume, listed his expert witness experience. The records of the Liberty arbitration were by then public, but the man referred to the matter only as Confidential v. Confidential. His online biography revealed more: Randazza\u2019s attorney is a former chair and current member of the ethics committee of the Nevada Bar.\n\nSomewhere in Gloucester, looking out at his hometown and dreaming of zealotry, the troll began to laugh.\n\nTop illustration: Owen Freeman.\n\nA few of the documents referenced in this story:\n\n1.)

In 2013, Lystra sued her OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\n\nBy Barbara Feder Ostrov and Harriet Blair Rowan\n\nThe doctor instructed his patient to stand in front of him. He cupped her crotch and inserted his fingers into her vagina through her clothes, moving his hand repeatedly to her rectal area. Then he squeezed her breasts, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of California.\n\nThe patient, accompanied to the appointment by her 4-year-old granddaughter, asked why that was necessary to diagnose a urinary tract infection, according to the documents. He told her to let him do his job.\n\nIn three other cases, the board alleged that the family doctor, Ramon Fakhoury of California\u2019s Inland Empire, touched patients\u2019 genitals for no medical reason. In 2016, the board handed him 35 months of administrative probation, requiring him, among other things, to have a chaperone when treating females.\n\nFakhoury did not admit to the allegations, according to his attorney, and criminal charges against him were dropped. If he successfully completes probation next year, he\u2019ll be able to practice without restriction.\n\nWith a mission of patient protection and doctor rehabilitation \u2014 not punishment \u2014 California\u2019s medical board and those in other states make decisions under laws and norms that can seem discordant in the #MeToo era.\n\nCalifornia is often cited as one of the more rigorous states in overseeing doctors. But, according to the medical board, very few sexual misconduct complaints are reported to the board in the first place, historically under 200 a year. Even fewer result in a formal accusation against a doctor. And when discipline is found to be warranted \u2014 typically in fewer than 20 cases a year \u2014 the board tends toward leniency, sometimes granting a few years of probation even in instances of severe misconduct, according to a KHN analysis of medical board records.\n\nMore than a third of doctors sanctioned by California\u2019s board in cases that alleged sexual misconduct received probation in the past 10 years \u2014 some more than once. The terms of probation \u2014 which is not a criminal court action but places conditions on a physician\u2019s license \u2014 often required temporary chaperones, as well as psychotherapy and courses in \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d and ethics. (Through probation, the medical board can only place conditions or restrictions on a doctor\u2019s license in civil proceedings; it does not take criminal court actions.)\n\n\u201cThey love giving second chances\u201d to physicians, said Marian Hollingsworth of San Diego, a frequent critic of the California medical board. \u201cIt makes you wonder where their priorities are \u2026 Their first loyalty is supposed to be patient safety and that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThe recent, shocking reports about years of abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and University of Southern California gynecologist George Tyndall \u2014 as well as national expos\u00e9s about physician misconduct by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Associated Press \u2014have only intensified concerns about whether sexual abuse is taken seriously enough in medicine.\n\nNassar, accused of abuse by scores of girls and women under the guise of medical treatment, is now serving what amounts to a life sentence. Prosecutors are considering criminal charges against Tyndall in more than 50 cases, and the state medical board has suspended his license while seeking revocation. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAnd just last week, 17 women sued Columbia University and its affiliated hospitals, alleging that the facilities engaged in covering up decades of sexual abuse by one of its OB-GYNs.\n\nResearch has shown that many doctors who sexually exploit patients, like other perpetrators of abuse, don\u2019t stop with one victim. They \u201cperpetrate such behavior for years before being stopped,\u201d said the authors of one study.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, California Gov. Jerry Brown in September signed landmark patient protection legislation requiring doctors who are on probation for sexual and other serious misconduct to notify patients of their status and the terms under which they must practice. It will take effect next July. The bill had failed twice before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the bill\u2019s lead author, Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo). \u201cThe #Me Too movement has really made it very clear that there are individuals even in the most respected professions who abuse their authority.\u201d\n\nEven as sexual abuse complaints filed with the medical board rose significantly in the past year to coincide with the rise of #MeToo, board officials say they plan no major changes in how the board dispenses discipline in sexual misconduct cases.\n\nThe #MeToo movement \u201chas not changed us,\u201d said the board\u2019s executive director, Kimberly Kirchmeyer. Cracking down on sexual misconduct has always been \u201cone of the board\u2019s top priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nDigging into the records\n\nKHN examined all 135 cases of alleged sexual abuse investigated by the board that resulted in sanctions from July 2008 through June 2018. (The analysis did not include discipline based on proceedings in other states.)\n\nMore than a third of sanctions were for sexual misconduct with more than one victim, and the vast majority of alleged perpetrators were men accused of exploiting women.\n\nDoctors\u2019 licenses were revoked in 39 cases and voluntarily surrendered in 38. Several doctors received public reprimands \u2014 a minor sanction.\n\nThe largest share of sanctions \u2014 49 cases, or more than a third \u2014 were for probation.\n\nAccording to the board\u2019s disciplinary guidelines, the minimum probation period is seven years for a doctor found to have engaged in sexual misconduct \u2014 whether it is a sexual relationship with a patient, sexualized touching during exams or inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nBut those \u201cminimums\u201d were not applied in more than half of the probation cases, according to the KHN analysis. The guidelines allow exceptions based on \u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d the age of cases, the quality of evidence and other factors.\n\nKirchmeyer noted that the board treats every case as unique and places a high value on a doctor\u2019s remorse and acknowledgment of wrongdoing.\n\nIn eight cases, KHN found, a doctor sanctioned for sexual misconduct had previously been sanctioned for similar misconduct.\n\nDr. Patrick Mark Sutton, a Pasadena obstetrician-gynecologist, received probation twice \u2014 the first time for four years after investigators alleged sexual misconduct in 2002. In 2011, he was placed on probation again \u2014 this time for three years \u2014 following allegations that he improperly rubbed a patient\u2019s thigh and engaged in inappropriate sexual conversation.\n\nHe denied all sexual misconduct allegations in 2002 and 2011, admitting only to medical record-keeping violations in both cases.\n\nThis September, after he had completed mandated ethics and \u201cboundaries\u201d courses, the medical board filed a new accusation against Sutton, saying that he had called a patient \u201chairy\u201d and asked the patient, who was naked from the waist down under a drape and in stirrups exposing her genitals: \u201cDo you enjoy orgasms? You are a very beautiful woman,\u201d according to the documents. That case is pending.\n\nSutton\u2019s lawyer, Gary Wittenberg, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe allegations in the pending accusation are untrue and we will prove that in court.\u201d\n\nIn several cases, the board granted probation knowing the doctor had been convicted of misdemeanor criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse investigations.\n\nFakhoury, the Inland Empire doctor, had faced felony sexual abuse-related charges but was not convicted due to a hung jury, according to San Bernardino County Superior Court records.\n\nHis lawyer, Courtney Pilchman, told Kaiser Health News that the criminal charges were dismissed afterward and that the doctor \u201cdid not stipulate\u201d to \u2014 or admit to \u2014 the medical board accusation.\n\nBy contrast, Ohio\u2019s medical board, upon learning of California\u2019s sanction, in 2012 revoked his state license.\n\nThe number of disciplinary actions taken over the decade is strikingly small given the size of California\u2019s practicing physician population of more than 100,000. Alleged victims of sexual abuse by physicians are significantly less likely to come forward than sexual abuse victims in general, some research indicates.\n\nHowever, numbers provided by the medical board suggest that many of the complaints that are filed \u2014 whether by victims themselves or other sources \u2014 do not result in formal accusations against doctors. From October 2013 through June 2018, 838 complaints were designated by the board as possible sexual misconduct. During that same period, 74 accusations were filed. (Multiple complaints could be filed about one doctor.)\n\nExperts and lawyers familiar with the board offered various explanations: Some complaints may be false. Doctor sexual misconduct can be hard to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as required in medical board cases. Accused physicians often hire experienced lawyers who aggressively fight back, leading to delays and deals. Victims may decline to testify or present poorly as witnesses.\n\nSome victims, for instance, have psychiatric disorders or believe that they were engaging in a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship, according to medical board documents.\n\nBoard staff have worked hard to treat alleged victims sensitively, Kirchmeyer said. Expert reviewers are instructed to read complaints as if the person is telling the truth, she said, and the board plans weeklong training sessions to help investigators work better with alleged victims and prepare them for testifying.\n\nThe cases often drag on. It can take years for victims to come forward in the first place \u2014 and more time for cases to wind their way through the state\u2019s complex bureaucracy. Evidence can go stale.\n\n\u201cPhysicians have to have due process,\u201d Kirchmeyer said. \u201cAnyone can make a complaint about anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nHeidi de Marco/KHN Tracy Lystra at her home in Aguanga, Calif.\n\n\u2018Slap in my face\u2019\n\nFacing what they see as an uphill battle, lawyers from the state Department of Justice, who handle administrative hearings, will sometimes pre-emptively recommend probation \u2014 even in serious sexual misconduct accusations \u2014 to avoid the possibility a doctor will get no sanction at all from a judge, said Laura Sweet, a former deputy director who retired in 2015.\n\nSweet, who worked for the medical board for 23 years, said the legal process focuses on the doctors and does not always give sufficient weight to the pain of alleged victims. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message that\u2019s potentially minimizing what the victim endured.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Tracy Lystra sees it, too. In 2013, Lystra sued her Fallbrook, California OB-GYN, Anthony S. Bianchi, alleging that he harassed her with comments about her body and how she aroused him, whispering into her ear as she lay on a gurney before surgery that she looked like a \u201csexy librarian.\u201d She said the case, which also alleged medical negligence, was settled for $150,000 in 2016. Bianchi, who could not be reached for comment, denied the allegations in court documents.\n\nThrough her attorney, Lystra filed a complaint to the medical board shortly after settling with Bianchi. This past July, she received a letter from the board saying it would not be able \u201cestablish grounds for discipline\u201d against Bianchi in her case, \u201cconsidering all the evidence and mitigating factors.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she learned that the board had received complaints from other women.\n\nIn 2014, Bianchi had been put on five years\u2019 probation after the board accused him of making inappropriate sexual remarks to two patients, telling one he dreamed of having oral sex with her and couldn\u2019t stop staring at her breasts. After learning of these cases, another woman came forward, alleging Bianchi several years earlier had blocked his office door with a chair, inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed his penis and asked her for sex.\n\nThe board\u2019s penalty was another five years\u2019 probation. But the two probation terms overlap \u2014 and Bianchi, who agreed not to contest the allegations as part of the settlements in each case, could go back to work as an OB-GYN without restrictions in 2021. In the meantime, he is not allowed to treat female patients.\n\nLearning that Bianchi received such a light punishment \u2014 and that the board would not take action on her own complaint \u2014 was crushing, Lystra said, noting that it had been so difficult to get anyone, including her family, to believe her.\n\n\u201cI really wanted him stopped. It was so disappointing when medical board responded the way it did,\u201d Lystra said.\u201cIt was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nIn its analysis, KHN requested every sanction for sexual misconduct issued by the Medical Board of California over the past 10 years, the name of each doctor involved and his or her license number. The board responded with 181 actions against 175 doctors from fiscal year 2008-09, beginning in July, through fiscal year 2017-2018, ending in June. (The records were designated by the board as primarily for sexual misconduct but often included other allegations.)\n\nKHN used the board\u2019s document lookup search on its website to review its available public records on each doctor. KHN mentioned sanctions outside the 10-year period when records showed the doctors were repeat offenders.\n\nThe analysis excluded cases in which the board took action in response to sanctions issued by other states\u2019 medical boards for sexual misconduct outside California.\n\nFor each sanction, KHN determined the number of alleged victims identified in the board\u2019s accusations, their gender, type of sanction, length and terms of probation, type of alleged sexual misconduct and whether the board took note of any previous or concurrent criminal proceedings.\n\nKHN also requested the number of complaints the board received alleging sexual misconduct, and how many formal accusations the board filed each year after the allegations were investigated and merited disciplinary action. The board did not have data for all 10 years, but provided the number of complaints received and the number of accusations filed from October 2013 through the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-28 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.
