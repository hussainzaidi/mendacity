The team gathered data on how each of those groups do across indicators like hate crimes, political representation, anti-discrimination laws, income inequality, incarceration rates and immigration and asylum policies.\n\nThey then compiled each group's performance on those indicators into a final score. Here's what they found:\n\nThe US lags far behind global leaders in inclusiveness\n\nIn 2016, the United States was one of the most inclusive countries in the world, ranking 23rd. In 2017, that ranking dropped to 69th.\n\nThe US has improved some since 2017, and it's now the 58th most inclusive country, according to the Haas Institute's index.\n\nThat still puts it in the medium category though, ranking behind countries like the Philippines, Poland and Nicaragua, but ahead of countries like Nigeria, Israel and India.\n\nThe biggest reason the US is consistently ranked as less inclusive than countries like the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom is the number of people in the US held in prisons and jails, said Stephen Menendian, an author of the report and assistant director of the Haas Institute.\n\nThe US has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. For every 100,000 people in the US, approximately 655 of them were behind bars, according to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nAnother factor dragging the US down is the Trump administration's refugee and immigration policies, according to the Haas Institute's report.\n\n\"It shouldn't be surprising for people who are paying attention to the headlines,\" said Menendian.\n\nSince President Trump took office, his administration has dramatically scaled back the number of refugees admitted by the US, even as the number of people displaced by war and famine surges across the world\n\nIn 2019, the US will cap refugee admissions at 30,000, the lowest level since 1980. The new cap is even lower than the record low 45,000 cap in 2018.\n\nTo put that number into context, the Obama administration set the cap at 110,000 refugees for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\n\"The country is rolling up the welcome mat and that's reflected in the data in our index,\" Menendian said.\n\nThe situation differs state by state\n\nIf you expected to see liberal, coastal states at the top of the inclusiveness list, the rankings might surprise you.\n\nStates like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut didn't make the top 10, while California only ranked number five.\n\nThe most inclusive state in the US is actually Hawaii, followed by Nevada, Maryland, Vermont and California, according to the Haas Institute's index. At the bottom of the list are Louisiana, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nHawaii's no. 1 ranking has a lot to do with its racial diversity.\n\nSeventy-five percent of people in Hawaii are non-white or biracial . Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, the state's representatives in the US House, are both women of color, and Sen. Mazie Hirono is of Japanese descent. It also has the country's highest percentage of nonwhite state legislators.\n\n\"If you think about Hawaii, which has a very multiethnic population, I'd say that the report accurately captures the degree to which people of various different ethnic origins are participating in the economy,\" said Camille Busette, a senior fellow for the Brookings Institution. \"That suggests inclusivity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the five least inclusive states have all enacted anti-Sharia laws , an indicator that the Haas Institute used to predict discrimination against all religious minorities.\n\nThe Haas Institute illustrated how inclusiveness changes from state to state through a number of real-world examples, including access to clean water and sewage services; gender-equality laws; and the enforcement of controversial immigration laws, such as family separations.\n\nStill, it's not all bad\n\nThe report's findings may seem grim, but the situation isn't hopeless.\n\nIn 2018, more states (12) became more inclusive than became less inclusive (11). Meanwhile, 27 stayed the same.\n\nMenendian said the US ranks in the middle on political representation of minorities, and the 2018 data doesn't take into account the results of the midterm elections.\n\nThe report also isn't all encompassing. Busette points out that the Haas Institute didn't touch on other important markers of exclusivity, such as food insecurity.\n\n\"Internationally, we know that food insecurity has been a problem, but in the US, food insecurity is also a problem and depending on where you are, it's more of a problem than not,\" she said.\n\nBusette added that inclusiveness is probably best measured at the neighborhood level. But she said the index could offer a more holistic picture of how inclusive states are if it also took into account factors like housing insecurity, healthcare insecurity and wealth disparity.\n\n\"The report focuses on income disparities, but not wealth disparities,\" she said. \"Wealth disparities tell you about the historical legacy of the lack of inclusion, the multi-generational policies that make it difficult for a particular group to generate wealth.\"\n\nMenendian cautioned that the index shouldn't be viewed as the end-all-be-all on how inclusive a country or state is.\n\n\"Our index is a good diagnostic instrument for trying to get a sense of how countries are faring and how states are faring against each other, but it's not the final word on these issues,\" he said.\n\nLastly, the report doesn't account for recent political developments that would presumably benefit a country's inclusiveness ranking."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Report: Half of US adults have immediate family member who has been in jail or prison", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/SX_wQjg3IBs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Half of US adults have an immediate family member who has been in jail or prison, a report released Thursday said.\n\nThe group FWD.us released the report outlining the results of a wide-ranging survey taken earlier this year, which showed further that one in seven people have an immediate family member who has spent a full year or longer in prison and one in 34 have an immediate family member who has spent 10 years or longer in prison.

Kim could also reveal key decisions on economic policy and inter-Korean relations.\n\nIn a sign of his new diplomatic push, Kim sent a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Sunday. In it, Kim said he regretted not being able to visit Seoul in 2018 but expressed a strong will to travel to the South Korean capital in the future.\n\nFew expect Kim to rock the boat dramatically in Tuesday's speech. Many believe the young leader holds some of the best cards of all the geopolitical players with a stake in the future of the Korean Peninsula. Most do not expect Kim to risk his standing in a speech that's largely intended for a domestic audience.\n\n\"He's got the United States and South Korea where they want them right now,\" said Evans Revere, a former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and current senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nNorth Korea's diplomatic achievements in 2018 would have been unthinkable a year earlier. In the lead up to Kim's 2018 New Year's speech, Pyongyang had tested its most advanced long-range missile to date and its most powerful nuclear bomb, after months of similar weapons tests and saber-rattling between North Korea and the US.\n\nFew would have predicted that the following year, Kim would meet Moon three times, leave his country for the first time since taking power in 2011 and become the first North Korean leader to sit face to face with a sitting US President.\n\nJUST WATCHED South Korean train heads North for first time in decade Replay More Videos ...

Kim spoke warmly of the importance of inter-Korean relations, and wished his South Korean compatriots well in hosting the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Pyongyang went on to test three ICBMs that year.\n\nJUST WATCHED Kim Jong Un's 2018 New Year's address Replay More Videos ...

The two leaders agreed to start rebuilding the bilateral relationship and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. In terms of nuclear weapons, North Korea committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" a vague term that experts say Washington and Pyongyang interpret differently.\n\nJUST WATCHED North Korea expert says nuclear threat remains Replay More Videos ...

North Korea has not agreed to any timeline to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nor has it committed itself to declaring its weaponry and key weapons facilities -- steps that experts say are crucial in any disarmament talks.\n\nExperts will be watching for any mention of the nuclear program in next year's speech, especially if it strikes the defiant tone of this year's address -- when Kim declared that \"no force and nothing\" could reverse the gains his country had made in nuclear weapons development.\n\n\"He said that this January, but he's engaged in this diplomatic process with the US,\" said Duyeon Kim, a adjunct fellow at the Center for New American Security.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see how Pyongyang negotiates going forward because Kim Jong Un claimed this year that nobody could reverse their nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nEconomics\n\nClues about what Pyongyang sees as the speech's key passages often come in the form of rhetorical devices, such as when Kim switches to a first-person voice, according to John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs in Seoul.\n\nDelury said he'll watch closely for comments about the country's economic development, something likely to be highly scrutinized inside North Korea and which could prove to be the most important part of the speech.\n\nIn the 2018 speech, Kim acknowledged that the moribund economy was in need of a boost and committed himself to improving it. However North Korea does not make its economic statistics available internationally, making it difficult to precisely track its economic performance and determine what proportion of its population works in more modern fields.\n\nJust days before his first summit with Moon in April , Kim took the drastic step of declaring that North Korea had successfully completed its nuclear weapons program and would suspend nuclear and missile tests. It would now solely focus on effort to \"dramatically raise people's lives\" by developing a \"strong socialist economy.\"\n\nThe two-pronged strategy of nuclear and economic development, known as \"byungjin,\" had been in place since shortly after Kim took the reins from his father in 2011. Abandoning it represented a significant policy shift.\n\nHowever, the regime has yet to articulate a coherent vision or plan with respect to development.\n\n\"There's some pressure in this year's New Year's speech to articulate a vision of a real focus on economic development,\" Delury said.\n\n\"How does Kim Jong Un reflect this strategic shift to economic development?\"\n\nIn recent months, North Korean state media has focused heavily on economic issues, often touting the importance that people inside the country work vigorously to increase production.\n\nBut that hardly constitutes a plan. Investors see North Korea as a land ripe with opportunities, and they're looking for a strategy that would allow for infrastructure investments connecting South Korea to Russia by rail or opening up North Korea's relatively well-educated, low-wage workforce to manufacturers from the region.\n\nAll of that, however, is off-limits at the moment due to the sanctions levied on Pyongyang as punishment for its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd Delury says it's unlikely for Kim to come out and just announce a detailed strategic shift. As is everything with North Korea, the devil will be in the details.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect a kind of revolutionary statement of a new economic concept, but you kind of have to look within their language for what are progressive ideas by North Korean standards,\" Delury said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Durex is recalling batches of its 'Real Feel' condoms over burst pressure concerns", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/F-re3oHhfNs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Stay calm.\n\nRB Health (Canada) Inc., the parent company of Durex, says there's \"no reason to be worried\" over the condoms they're recalling.\n\nThe company announced they'll be pulling certain batches of Durex Real Feel condoms off the shelves in Canada after they failed to pass shelf-life durability tests.\n\n\"There is no safety concern for consumers and only specific batches are affected,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nHealth Canada, the national public health department issued its own alert following the announcement, stating the affected condoms are \"not expected to meet the registered burst pressure specification at end of shelf-life.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "At least 15 killed as Bangladesh election turns violent", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/AQkuXH8xV-k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Bangladesh's Sheikh Hasina has won a third consecutive term as prime minister, the country's Election Commission said Monday, in a poll marred by deadly violence and allegations of rigged ballots.\n\nHasina's ruling Awami League (AL) party won a landslide of 288 votes out of a possible 300, according to the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi, with just one seat left to be declared.

Beijing has begun pushing for a greater stake in the region with a view to opening new trade routes, exploring for oil and gas and conducting research on climate change, experts say.\n\nGeographically, China is nowhere near the Arctic Circle, which puts the Asian powerhouse at a major political disadvantage compared to eight countries that make up the Arctic Council, all of whom have territory inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nCouncil members are divided on China's growing interest in the region.

And the Arctic states are eager to keep it that way.\n\n'Brimming with economic potential'\n\nBeijing claims the main reason for its interest in the Arctic is scientific research.\n\nIn the white paper, it detailed a desire to investigate the effects of climate change to \"resolve global environmental issues.\"\n\nBut skeptics have argued that China's Arctic ambitions are largely fueled by the economic and political appeal of dominating a resource-rich area.\n\nIt is estimated that the Arctic may hold nearly one-third of the world's natural gas and 13% of global oil reserves, according to a report by Rachael Gosnell at the University of Maryland.\n\nAnd as rising temperatures melt the region's ice, shipping routes that were once impassible are now an attractive and feasible alternative for the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The Arctic is brimming with economic potential,\" said Gosnell, who estimates that the annual economy of the region exceeds $450 billion.\n\nAccording to NASA, some global climate models predict the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months by the middle of this century, likely making its waters an important shipping route.\n\n\"China really wants to put itself in a position whereby, should there be some kind of scramble or push for Arctic resources, China would be very well placed to take advantage of that,\" said Lanteigne, the polar region expert.\n\nTo secure that position, it is strengthening its Arctic capabilities. In September, China launched a second icebreaker known as Xue Long 2, or Snow Dragon 2, with an expedition scheduled for the first half of 2019, according to state-run media.\n\nThe newly minted vessel is the first Chinese-built icebreaker. The China State Shipbuilding Corporation claims it will be more capable of cutting through ice and carrying out advanced research than its foreign-built predecessor.\n\nChina's first domestically-built icebreaker, Xuelong 2, during a launch ceremony at a shipyard in Shanghai in September.\n\nWashington's loss, Beijing's gain\n\nChina has been quick to recognize the importance of investing in the Arctic at a time when there are few participants and even fewer laws, so that it can eventually restructure Arctic governance in its favor, said Harriet Moynihan, associate fellow at the UK think tank Chatham House.\n\nChina's increasing involvement in the Arctic Circle has also coincided with a growing lack of interest from Washington.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to eliminate a special envoy and representative for the Arctic region in 2017, as climate change dropped down the list of priorities for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter World War II, the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet. In 2018 only two functioning icebreakers remain, one of which is a heavy-duty vessel overdue for an update.\n\nThe Obama administration pursued an ambitious Arctic strategy to ensure the US remained a strong power in regional affairs, including plans to replace the heavy icebreaker by 2020.\n\nBut it's unclear where the US now stands on those plans. The US Coast Guard, which runs the icebreakers, faces significant budget cuts as more and more funding is reconsidered for border security.\n\n\"Because of the fact that the Arctic is not a priority for the Trump government, this has allowed China to take the steering wheel and accelerate their own Arctic policies,\" Lanteigne said.\n\nRussia is arguably the most active Arctic state, with a fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, and it is reluctant to allow non-Arctic countries to develop the region.\n\nBut facing mounting Western sanctions, Moscow's attitude toward China has warmed considerably. \"Russia realized that China was one of the few countries left that could really help with Siberian development,\" Lanteigne said.\n\n\"The two countries have cooperated in a number of Arctic ventures, including a liquefied natural gas project.\"\n\nWith large parts of the Arctic still difficult for China to reach, it remains less important to Beijing than investments in other parts of the world, such as Africa and South Asia.\n\nBut China's presence in the far north is only likely to grow -- whether the Arctic states are pleased about it or not."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "'50-50' chance Brexit won't happen, says senior minister", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/qGBad1OBC2A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) A senior UK government minister has warned there is a \"50-50\" chance Brexit won't happen, if Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is voted down in Parliament next month.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter, told the Sunday Times that the only way to be \"100% certain\" Britain will leave the European Union is if ministers back the deal.\n\nThe UK is scheduled to exit the bloc on March 29 next year.

The team gathered data on how each of those groups do across indicators like hate crimes, political representation, anti-discrimination laws, income inequality, incarceration rates and immigration and asylum policies.\n\nThey then compiled each group's performance on those indicators into a final score. Here's what they found:\n\nThe US lags far behind global leaders in inclusiveness\n\nIn 2016, the United States was one of the most inclusive countries in the world, ranking 23rd. In 2017, that ranking dropped to 69th.\n\nThe US has improved some since 2017, and it's now the 58th most inclusive country, according to the Haas Institute's index.\n\nThat still puts it in the medium category though, ranking behind countries like the Philippines, Poland and Nicaragua, but ahead of countries like Nigeria, Israel and India.\n\nThe biggest reason the US is consistently ranked as less inclusive than countries like the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom is the number of people in the US held in prisons and jails, said Stephen Menendian, an author of the report and assistant director of the Haas Institute.\n\nThe US has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. For every 100,000 people in the US, approximately 655 of them were behind bars, according to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nAnother factor dragging the US down is the Trump administration's refugee and immigration policies, according to the Haas Institute's report.\n\n\"It shouldn't be surprising for people who are paying attention to the headlines,\" said Menendian.\n\nSince President Trump took office, his administration has dramatically scaled back the number of refugees admitted by the US, even as the number of people displaced by war and famine surges across the world\n\nIn 2019, the US will cap refugee admissions at 30,000, the lowest level since 1980. The new cap is even lower than the record low 45,000 cap in 2018.\n\nTo put that number into context, the Obama administration set the cap at 110,000 refugees for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\n\"The country is rolling up the welcome mat and that's reflected in the data in our index,\" Menendian said.\n\nThe situation differs state by state\n\nIf you expected to see liberal, coastal states at the top of the inclusiveness list, the rankings might surprise you.\n\nStates like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut didn't make the top 10, while California only ranked number five.\n\nThe most inclusive state in the US is actually Hawaii, followed by Nevada, Maryland, Vermont and California, according to the Haas Institute's index. At the bottom of the list are Louisiana, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nHawaii's no. 1 ranking has a lot to do with its racial diversity.\n\nSeventy-five percent of people in Hawaii are non-white or biracial . Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, the state's representatives in the US House, are both women of color, and Sen. Mazie Hirono is of Japanese descent. It also has the country's highest percentage of nonwhite state legislators.\n\n\"If you think about Hawaii, which has a very multiethnic population, I'd say that the report accurately captures the degree to which people of various different ethnic origins are participating in the economy,\" said Camille Busette, a senior fellow for the Brookings Institution. \"That suggests inclusivity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the five least inclusive states have all enacted anti-Sharia laws , an indicator that the Haas Institute used to predict discrimination against all religious minorities.\n\nThe Haas Institute illustrated how inclusiveness changes from state to state through a number of real-world examples, including access to clean water and sewage services; gender-equality laws; and the enforcement of controversial immigration laws, such as family separations.\n\nStill, it's not all bad\n\nThe report's findings may seem grim, but the situation isn't hopeless.\n\nIn 2018, more states (12) became more inclusive than became less inclusive (11). Meanwhile, 27 stayed the same.\n\nMenendian said the US ranks in the middle on political representation of minorities, and the 2018 data doesn't take into account the results of the midterm elections.\n\nThe report also isn't all encompassing. Busette points out that the Haas Institute didn't touch on other important markers of exclusivity, such as food insecurity.\n\n\"Internationally, we know that food insecurity has been a problem, but in the US, food insecurity is also a problem and depending on where you are, it's more of a problem than not,\" she said.\n\nBusette added that inclusiveness is probably best measured at the neighborhood level. But she said the index could offer a more holistic picture of how inclusive states are if it also took into account factors like housing insecurity, healthcare insecurity and wealth disparity.\n\n\"The report focuses on income disparities, but not wealth disparities,\" she said. \"Wealth disparities tell you about the historical legacy of the lack of inclusion, the multi-generational policies that make it difficult for a particular group to generate wealth.\"\n\nMenendian cautioned that the index shouldn't be viewed as the end-all-be-all on how inclusive a country or state is.\n\n\"Our index is a good diagnostic instrument for trying to get a sense of how countries are faring and how states are faring against each other, but it's not the final word on these issues,\" he said.\n\nLastly, the report doesn't account for recent political developments that would presumably benefit a country's inclusiveness ranking."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "From paychecks to pups: Get ready for new laws in 2019", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/b4HCliszX6E/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When the New Year's confetti comes down at midnight, so will a wave of new laws across the country.\n\nFrom jury duty to pet purchases, here's a look at some of the changes for 2019:\n\nMinimum wages will get a boost\n\nAt least 19 states will increase their minimum wages on or around New Year's Day, according to the National Employment Law Project\n\nThe group's executive director, Christine Owens, said the increases come after years of frustration by hard-working, lower-income Americans.\n\n\"Working people are struggling to pay their bills, but they see that it's the corporations and the wealthy CEOs who are getting the tax breaks.

But there are now questions about whether or not he will follow through on his promise to supporters to build a concrete wall. During her appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Conway repeatedly referred to it as \"border security\" and not a wall.

Lindsey Graham suggested Sunday President Donald Trump now better understands the stakes in Syria and has agreed to reevaluate, for now, his plans to immediately withdraw all US troops from the country.\n\nStill, Graham said, Trump remains committed to bringing American servicemen and women home, even as he continues to weigh the greater regional dynamics. He told CNN later in the day the President had not reversed his Syria orders.\n\n\"After discussions with the President and (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph) Dunford, I never felt better about where we are headed. I think we're slowing things down in a smart way,\" the South Carolina Republican told reporters at the White House, where he'd just sat for lunch with the President. \"But the goal has always been the same. To be able to leave Syria and make sure ISIS never comes back.\"\n\nHe added later: \"I think we're in a pause situation where we are reevaluating what's the best way to achieve the President's objective of having people pay more and do more.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Dana Bash after his appearance in the White House driveway, Graham said he didn't mean to suggest that Trump is pausing troop withdrawal altogether.\n\n\"He has not reversed his decision\" to withdraw troops from Syria, Graham said. \"The pause is to assess the effects of the conditions on the ground.\"\n\nThe White House did not clarify whether Trump had come to a new determination about the Syria withdrawal plans, which drew widespread criticism when they were first announced earlier this month. National security adviser John Bolton is scheduled to travel to Israel and Turkey early in the new year to discuss the decision with partners in the region.\n\nGraham said that during the President's surprise trip to Iraq last week, commanders on the ground informed Trump that ISIS is not \"completely destroyed,\" which he said was an \"eye-opening\" experience for the commander in chief.\n\n\"The President assured me he is going to make sure he gets the job done, and I assured him that nobody has done more to defeat ISIS than he has. We are inside the 10-yard line,\" Graham told reporters at the White House.\n\nGraham, who was a harsh critic of Trump's plans to bring home US troops from Syria when the decision was announced earlier in December, said he departed his meal Sunday feeling cheered.\n\n\"I feel better about Syria than I felt before I had lunch. The President is taking this really seriously. The trip to Iraq was well timed,\" he said.\n\nYet during that trip, his first to a US war zone, Trump reinforced his Syria decision and said the US would no longer be viewed as \"suckers\" for protecting other nations.\n\n\"They said again recently, 'Could we have more time?' \" Trump said of top military officials. \"I said, 'Nope. You can't have any more time. You've got enough time.' We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Graham said that withdrawing US troops from Syria could directly result in the deaths of Kurdish people there.\n\n\"There are three things important for this country. Number one, make sure that ISIS never comes back in Syria,\" Graham said to CNN's Bash on \"State of the Union.\" \"We need to keep our troops there. They're inside the ten-yard line in defeating ISIS, but we're not there yet. If we leave now, the Kurds are going to get slaughtered.\"\n\n\"How are you going to convince President Trump to do that?\" Bash asked.\n\n\"I'm going to talk to him at lunch,\" Graham replied.\n\nTrump's decision earlier this month to order his staff to execute the \"full\" and \"rapid\" withdrawal of US military from Syria was met with harsh criticism from both sides of the aisle. Hours after the announcement, Graham decried the move as a \"disaster\" and \"a stain on the honor of the United States.\"\n\nOn Sunday, he warned against the transfer of security in Syria from the US to Russian and Turkish forces, a change that could leave the Syrian Kurds, whom the United States has assisted and armed, at risk from both ISIS and Turkey.\n\n\"I'm asking the President to make sure that we have troops there to protect us. Don't outsource our national security to some foreign power,\" Graham told CNN earlier on Sunday. \"If we leave now the Kurds will get in a fight with Turkey, they could get slaughtered. Who would help you in the future?\"\n\n\"And this is something you're going to tell the President today?\" Bash asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm going to ask the President to do something President Obama would never do: reconsider,\" Graham replied.\n\nThis story has been updated to add further comments by Sen.

Progressives are pushing for a \"Green New Deal\" -- a comprehensive package that would reimagine the US economy and the government's place in it -- that has been met with skepticism, and a few notes of hostility, by party centrists. Other fights are brewing over raising the national minimum wage, trade and Middle East policy.\n\nThese internal disputes will play out on two stages over the coming year -- the floor of the newly Democratic-controlled House, and in the 2020 primary debates, which begin in June\n\nParty angst over how to beat Trump in 2020 will fuel these fights, with establishment forces worried about alienating the suburban moderates who powered the party's 2018 wave while the insurgent progressives make the case that only bold new initiatives can renew -- and turn out -- its working class base.\n\nHere is a look ahead at some of the debates that will animate the coming year.\n\nGetting real about 'Medicare for all'\n\n\"Medicare for all,\" a form of single-payer health care, is the party's most popular big-ticket proposal for delivering on its promise of universal health care -- a solution to the ongoing challenges facing the Affordable Care Act that even former President Barack Obama seemed to endorse in a speech this past fall\n\nLawmakers and liberal think tanks began to sketch out the narrower terms of the debate in 2018, rolling out a variety of plans that would either chart a path to universal government-backed care or expand coverage by allowing Americans to \"buy in\" to programs like Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe push for a \"buy in\" offer, which would effectively create some form of the \"public option\" scuppered by Congressional Democrats during the Obamacare negotiations in 2009, was given a boost during the party's leadership scramble after New York Rep. Brian Higgins, secured an assurance last month from Nancy Pelosi to prioritize a plan to allow people 50 and older to buy into Medicare.\n\nBut with Democrats still in the Senate minority and shut out of the White House, proponents of more comprehensive reform are unlikely to accept compromise terms.\n\nLast year, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate who caucuses with the Democrats, secured 16 cosponsors to his latest and most detailed legislation, which introduced a four-year plan for gradually moving millions of Americans onto the rolls of a beefed-up version of Medicare.\n\nAt least five of the names on the bill, in addition to Sanders', are considering runs in 2020 -- New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who helped write the transition plan, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\n\"There's going to be a question if any of those (other potential presidential candidates) take power: Do they actually want to create a single-payer program or is it just a messaging strategy to win people over with big ideas?,\" Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for the progressive group Justice Democrats, told CNN. \"Do they support the end of private health insurance in the United States of America. Because that is what the bill is proposing to do. We're going to get way more into the specifics than we did in 2016.\"\n\nRaising worker wages\n\nSince Democrats last held the House in 2010, a movement for higher minimum wages has swept through the states, making $15 an hour the new benchmark for a livable income. A bill to move the national minimum wage to that level by 2024 is on the Democratic to-do list \u2014 but already, some on the left think that's too timid.\n\nThe proposals attracting the most attention, if not votes, are those that super-size the federal safety net and provide a public option for employment meant to raise wages by creating more competition for workers.\n\nHarris' LIFT Act would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to so many people that it resembles a \"universal basic income,\" an idea that has gained momentum over the past year. Alternatively, Sanders and Gillibrand have proposed a federal \"job guarantee,\" which would provide employment on public works projects to whomever wants to work.\n\nBut the bulk of the caucus probably won't go that far. Members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition are coalescing behind a proposal from Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell that would create regional minimum wages pegged to the variable costs of living, from midtown Manhattan to Beckley, West Virginia. According to a framework devised by the centrist think tank Third Way, wage floors would range from $9.30 in the cheapest places to $11.90 in the most expensive.\n\nThe debate is playing out against a difference of opinion around the root causes of stagnant wage growth.\n\nCentrists see the problem as a failure to help workers adapt to the trends of automation and globalization, which demands fixes such as more job training, apprenticeships, and vocational programs to equip them for high-demand careers like nursing, advanced manufacturing, and data science.\n\nOn the progressive left, however, a consensus is emerging that the real challenge is the rise of corporate consolidation and the decline of worker bargaining power. That in turn has allowed businesses to funnel excess profits to shareholders rather than higher wages, which would incentivize workers to pursue the type of education that made the most sense for them financially.\n\nIn order to take aim at that issue, Democrats like Booker and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin have introduced bills that would restrict companies' ability to buy back their own stock as well as direct federal regulators to scrutinize corporate mergers more carefully.\n\n\"We think what's really important is that policymakers are articulating a diagnosis of the economy that really centers the role of outsized corporate power, and the role of government to curb that power,\" says Stephanie Sterling, vice president for advocacy and policy at the Roosevelt Institute. \"We're not going to upskill our way to an economy where working people are getting a fair share.\"\n\nHooking infrastructure money to the end of fossil fuels\n\nPretty much everybody in Washington agrees that America's deteriorating roads, bridges, train tracks, transit networks and utilities need a surge of investment. But some Democrats argue those fixes should be wrapped into a plan to phase out fossil fuels entirely and massively scale up capacity for renewable energy generation in an effort to address global warming and lingering joblessness in one fell swoop.\n\nAn energized grassroots coalition led by freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez waged a campaign against House leadership to set up a select committee focused on crafting a \"Green New Deal,\" which would decarbonize the economy and provide universal employment.\n\nThe campaign for a committee failed, and there are still parts of the Democratic Party \u2014 such as transportation and building trade unions, whose members currently depend on continuing investment in highway construction and natural gas pipelines \u2014 who remain skeptical. But activists have vowed to keep fighting for the proposal as infrastructure plans surface in the next session, and they already have the support of 43 current or incoming members of Congress.\n\n\"The more momentum there is for a Green New Deal, the more that pulls the entire infrastructure debate in a bold direction,\" says Adam Green, co-director of a left-wing advocacy group called the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"It's not crazy to think that we could leave this year with 100 or even 150, 200 members who believe the Green New Deal is a North Star for when we have more power in 2021.\"\n\nA delicate line on trade\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic establishment was blindsided by how much anger Trump channeled by invoking the harsh legacy of trade deals in the industrial Midwest. Now they have to figure out how to heed that anger, while also avoiding Trump's chest-thumping rhetoric on tariffs, which turns off voters in both agricultural and urban districts.\n\n\"I think there's a danger with agreeing too much with Donald Trump on trade,\" said Third Way policy vice president Jim Kessler. \"We've seen the price that we're paying for tariffs. There's a difference between getting tough on China and igniting a trade war.\"\n\nThe new Congress will be forced to confront trade issues by way of a vote on the update to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Few Democrats are completely happy with the re-branded U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement, but enough of them view it as a step in the right direction \u2014 curtailing corporations' right to sue nations over restrictions on investments, for example \u2014 that it has a chance of passing, with some tweaks.\n\nThe problem is, the changes demanded by trade-skeptical Democrats may lose votes among more conservative Democrats, not to mention Republicans. A band of progressives led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut have demanded stronger enforcement mechanisms for the new labor and environmental standards, as well as a rollback of the intellectual property protections that grant pharmaceutical companies years-long monopolies on drugs.\n\nWhat happens in this fight will matter in 2020, as Democrats try to avoid letting Trump claim victory on trade while also dropping the established position that globalization creates more winners than losers.\n\nA new direction for the Middle East?\n\nDemocratic leaders have rushed to embrace their historically diverse slate of nominees. But as those newly elected voices enter Congress, a vexing question hangs on the horizon: When it comes to Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East, does the party establishment really want to hear what they have to say?\n\nTrump's own renewed focus on the Middle East -- including his withdrawal from Syria, his reaction to the killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing war in Yemen -- have returned focus to the region generally at a time when peace negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians have collapsed.\n\nIncoming lawmakers like Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar are all challenging mainstream Democratic orthodoxy over the US' relationship with Israel.\n\nThe first two Muslim women elected to Congress, Tlaib and Omar have expressed support for the movement to boycott Israel over its activities in the West Bank and Gaza. BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, is a controversial program that has been met with harsh opposition by Israel and its supporters \u2014 particularly elected officials in the American government. A Senate bill called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would ban US companies from taking part in international boycotts like BDS, pits sponsors from both parties against progressive rivals and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes it on free speech grounds.\n\nThe bill remains in limbo for now, stalled after Sanders and Caifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein stated their opposition in a letter addressed to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"While we do not support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, we remain resolved to our constitutional oath to defend the right of every American to express their views peacefully without fear of or actual punishment by the government,\" Feinstein and Sanders wrote.\n\n\"Straight up, the party is not ready for the debate that is coming,\" one senior Democratic Senate aide told CNN. \"It is an overdue debate and my strong sense is that no, the party is not ready to have it \u2014 look who the foreign policy leaders are. But that doesn't matter because it's coming.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "American doctor will be monitored in US after possible exposure to Ebola in Congo", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/WwbbbIFHnsc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American was possibly exposed to Ebola while recently providing medical assistance in Congo, according to a release from the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health.\n\nThe person, who has not been identified, is headed to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for monitoring, the release states, adding the Nebraska Medical Center is home to one of the nation's few dedicated biocontainment units.\n\n\"This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,\" said Ted Cieslak, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health. \"Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them.\"\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is going through one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history.

His childhood memories -- in the German states of Bavaria and Hesse -- were shaped by monthly visits to the doctor, where he says up to 50 researchers would observe examinations of his naked body.\n\nWhen he reached puberty, Lynn was given growth blockers and high doses of hormones; as a teenager, he started self-harming, developed post-traumatic stress disorder and became suicidal.\n\nLynn, 34 -- who has asked CNN to identify him by his preferred name -- was born with both male and female sex organs. His doctors and parents decided shortly after he was born that his sex would be female, so his penis and testicles were surgically removed. His ovaries were also removed.\n\nDoctors had told Lynn's parents the surgeries were preventative, citing concerns that he could develop cancer, but Lynn says there was no medical reason for him to be operated on and that the surgeries were carried out with a \"dubious motivation.\"\n\n\"The doctors advised my parents not to tell me about my sex and simply raise me as a girl,\" Lynn told CNN. \"And of course, it didn't work -- because I'm not a girl.\"\n\nLynn D. plans to register as intersex on his birth certificate in the new year.\n\nLynn is intersex, an umbrella term used to describe a variety of conditions in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit into binary definitions of female or male.\n\n\"I was labeled a girl; I wanted to be a girl and fit in -- but it did not work. I got along better with boys so I thought, 'I'm a boy'. But then I realized that I'm not a boy either ... boys also started to marginalize me. I did not have a good connection with my body and nobody helped me to establish a good connection with my body,\" Lynn said.\n\nLynn only learned that he was intersex during a therapy session at the age of 20. It was a revelation for Lynn, who had struggled to fit in with his peers for so many years.\n\nWhile it helped him to move forward with his relationship with his own body, Lynn says it damaged his relationship with his parents.\n\n\"My body was changed so much to fit in -- whether it happened consciously or unconsciously. The whole experience broke my relationship with my parents. We still have not gotten over this yet,\" Lynn said.\n\nMy body was changed so much to fit in Lynn D.\n\nWhen he first learned he was intersex, Lynn said, \"it felt like as if someone said I am an alien, you are from someplace else. You are a mutant.\"\n\n\"It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and for me to (come to) grips with it. But then I understood -- everything made sense to me. I no longer felt restless. Suddenly I understood who I was.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, Lynn said he has evolved into an \"enormously happy\" person, someone who is in a loving relationship with a woman, and who is fulfilled by a career in engineering and gigging in a punk band.\n\nWhile Lynn said he accepts being called \"him\" for now, he wishes that there was a specific German pronoun to describe intersex people, and hopes that society will one day understand what it means to live outside of binary definitions of sex and gender -- and to accept intersex people for who they are.\n\nA change to the German constitution could be the first step toward that recognition.\n\nOn January 1, Germany will become the first country in the European Union to offer a \"third gender\" option on birth certificates.\n\nIntersex people -- and parents of intersex babies -- will be able to register as \"divers,\" or miscellaneous, on birth certificates, instead of having to choose between male or female.\n\nLast year, Germany's highest court ruled in favor of Vanja's rights to officially identify as an intersex person.\n\nThe court ruled that Vanja -- an intersex person who goes by a one-name pseudonym and uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" -- had their \"right to positive gender recognition\" violated and found that the current law was unconstitutional.\n\nVanja, whose case was supported by advocacy group, \"Dritte Option\" or, the Third Option, told CNN that having to decide between being a woman or a man on official documents left them feeling \"left out and overlooked.\"\n\nWhile Vanja's official identification documents said they were female, this led to \"a lot of irritations with people\" because they presented -- or physically appeared in society -- as male.\n\nVanja initially considered changing their documents to male, but eventually decided that decision would devalue their identity, which is intersex.\n\n\"I thought to myself, if I am going at lengths to change something within the red tape system in Germany, I want to have something that suits me,\" they said.\n\nVanja plans to celebrate the new law by changing their birth certificate category to \"divers\" in the new year, calling it both a personal and a practical step.\n\n\"I asked myself so many times what it means to be intersex; I often was upset when I had to decide which box to tick -- male or female. I felt (like I was) being pushed into the corner, that I had to adjust non-voluntarily. I think it will give me a new feeling of peace,\" Vanja said, adding that they hope other countries in Europe will follow suit.\n\nActivists from \"Dritte Option,\" or Third Option lobbied since 2014 for a third gender to be officially recognized in Germany.\n\nBut, like many in the intersex community, Vanja believes the law is just a stepping stone.\n\n\"Societal acceptance cannot be mandated by a court ruling, but it is a step in the right direction,\" Vanja said.\n\nLynn agrees. While he also plans to register as intersex -- and to officially change his name to Lynn -- he said there are still many steps that need to be taken for intersex people to be \"fully integrated into society.\"\n\nStill, he is hopeful the new law will help to bring attention to the medical treatment of intersex people and open conversations for change.\n\n'Ritualized, sexualized violence'\n\nInfants born with visible variations in their sexual characteristics, like Lynn, often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published last year.\n\nThe surgeries stem from a theory popularized in the United States in the 1960s by the psychologist John Money, who believed that an intersex person's make-up was a product of abnormal processes. Money believed that intersex people ought to become either male or female and as a result, were in need of medical treatment.\n\nAlthough that theory is no longer widely accepted in the medical community, its \"echoes can still be found within the medical establishment today,\" according to the Amnesty report, citing interviews with medical professionals across Denmark, Germany and the UK.\n\nThose surgeries stripped Lynn of his bodily autonomy and left him with painful scars.\n\n\"When they (doctors and parents) talked about my body, I had to go out and leave the room. In hindsight, it was a practice I would now compare with a ritualized, sexualized violence. It was massively traumatizing,\" Lynn says of his childhood visits to the doctor.\n\nA group of United Nations and international human rights experts called for \" an urgent end to human rights violations against intersex children and adults\" in 2016, calling on governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nBetween 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population are born with intersex traits, and are at risk of human rights violations that include surgery, discrimination and torture, according to the UN.\n\nIn July, a group of European medical experts published a set of new guidelines that urge doctors to defer medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children until they are old enough to consent. The European consensus said: \"For sensitive and/or irreversible procedures, such as genital surgery, we advise that the intervention be postponed until the individual is old enough to be actively involved in the decision whenever possible.\"\n\nGrietje Baars, a senior lecturer at The City Law School in London, told CNN that while the new law demonstrates a \"greater recognition of life beyond the binary,\" the \"third gender\" option doesn't go far enough to fully recognize gender diversity.\n\nUnder the new law, people wanting to change their birth certificate to read \"divers\" will only be able to do so with a medical certificate to prove it.\n\nBaars -- who also goes by the gender-neutral pronouns, \"they\" and \"them\" -- says that requirement could subject intersex people, who often have a history of \"traumatic medical interference with their genitalia\" to additional trauma. Plus, Baars says, the medical requirement reinforces an antiquated definition of gender based solely on biology.\n\n\"You can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia,\" they said, adding that it might be time to remove gender from official documents altogether. While Baars understands that this might sound radical, they argue that \"abolishing gender registration does not mean abolishing gender as such.\"\n\n\"It's like abolishing registering your religion or race on your ID or documents -- it does not mean you can no longer be Catholic or black ... those things are not the same. I am just saying that it is no business of the state to register and categorize people in that manner,\" they said.\n\nChallenging social norms\n\nAlthough German law has allowed parents to leave the gender box blank on birth certificates since 2013 -- and this will still be an option under the new legislation -- some experts say parents will still be inclined to choose a more traditional approach, noting that in the two years after the blank box option came into effect, only 12 children were registered without a sex marker in the birth registry.\n\nAnike Kr\u00e4mer, a Ph.D. candidate in gender studies at Germany's Ruhr-University Bochum, told CNN that she believes that parents of intersex children will have \"difficulties\" with the choices presented with the new law.\n\n\"The structure we have right now simply does not allow for parents to embrace this new law. The medical advice is still very conservative and advises to go with the binary system,\" Kr\u00e4mer said.\n\nYou can not simply decide gender by looking at people's genitalia Dr. Grietje Baars\n\nUnder German law, parents can not generally consent to \"feminizing,\" \"masculinizing\" or \"disambiguation\" surgeries, unless it is deemed medically necessary or life threatening, according to the German Inter-ministerial Working Group, IMAG.\n\nHowever, the law currently does not ban these surgeries for children too young to consent, and leaves the often ambiguous question of what is deemed surgically necessary up to medical professionals who might continue to characterize intersex people's bodily traits as disorders.\n\nKr\u00e4mer says that parents are more concerned with the every day questions their children will face in society: \"How do I call my child; which pronoun should I use, what do I tell my neighbor, how do I educate my intersex child?\n\n\"Sociologically speaking, parents lack options for action. Apart from medical consultations they often lack alternatives. If there are true alternatives in place -- to address the parents' questions, fears, difficulties and options, to speak with other intersex individuals or other parents of intersex individuals -- then that would make it easier for parents to perhaps choose the third option at the registry entry.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"But Germany is not that far yet,\" Kr\u00e4mer said, adding that the law's medical requirements \"misses a chance to create a wider law for more people,\" and sidelines other individuals who are not intersex but do not identify as only male or female, such as members of the trans community.\n\nAnd she is not alone.\n\nMarkus Ulrich, spokesman for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, told CNN that the law \"does not go far enough to protect people of non-binary identities.\"\n\nUlrich said that while the law was \"a huge step forward in acknowledging more rights and ... visibility for people beyond 'man and woman,'\" the government effectively ignored an alternative option proposed by the constitutional court last year to abolish gender registration all together -- a more inclusive option for people whose birth sex doesn't fit their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ campaigners say the new law excludes members of the trans community.\n\nA handful of German politicians, including members of the Green Party and the Social Democratic Party, have also criticized the law's medical certificate stipulation, pointing to other countries that allow people who don't identify in binary terms to change their official documents to match their gender identity.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian High Court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And in 2017, California became the second US state ( after New York ) to allow residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.\n\nSeveral other countries have provided gender-neutral options on passports and official documents such as the census or ID cards, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, India, Malta, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan.\n\nWhile intersex, trans and other human rights advocates continue to call for Germany's new law to be made more inclusive, Lynn hopes that at least this first step will help society to understand intersex people better -- and to not be afraid.\n\n\"We are all normal people and want to live our lives like others,'' he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Opioids are killing more children and teens, too, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/bV5ZsKRfFys/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A growing number of children and adolescents in the United States are dying from opioid poisonings, a new study shows.\n\nNearly 9,000 pediatric deaths were attributed to opioids from 1999 through 2016, according to a report published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open . During that 18-year span, the mortality rate for youth due to opioid poisoningsnearly tripled.\n\n\"What began more than 2 decades ago as a public health problem primarily among young and middle-aged white males is now an epidemic of prescription and illicit opioid abuse that is taking a toll on all segments of US society, including the pediatric population,\" researchers wrote. \"Millions of children and adolescents are now routinely exposed in their homes, schools and communities to these potent and addictive drugs.\"\n\nResearch released earlier this year in the journal Pediatrics showed that the number of children admitted to hospitals for opioid overdoses nearly doubled from 2004 to 2015.\n\nThis new study set out to examine who's dying.\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nOf the 8,986 children and adolescents who died from opioid poisonings over the 18-year period, 6,567 (about 73%) were male and 7,921 (about 88%) were adolescents ranging in age from 15 to 19. Among the 15- to 19-year-olds, 3,050 deaths also involved one or more other substances, such as benzodiazepines, cocaine, alcohol or antidepressants.\n\nNearly 7% of deaths were children ages zero to 4, about 4% were 10 to 14 and about 1% were ages 5 to 9.\n\nNon-Hispanic white children and adolescents made up the majority, nearly 80%, of those who died. Hispanic youth accounted for more than 10% of the deaths, while non-Hispanic black youth were about 7% of the death total.\n\nPrescription opioids accounted for 73% of the deaths, but heroin killed nearly 1,900 (about 24%) of those age 15 to 19.\n\nThe bulk of these opioid deaths, nearly 81% of them, were unintentional. Five percent were suicides and 2.4% were homicides. But for children younger than 5, nearly a quarter of the deaths were labeled homicides; among infants, it was closer to 35%.\n\nThe importance of place\n\nWhere children and adolescents died was also examined, since most other research has focused on results from emergency room visits and hospitalizations, the researchers said.\n\nThey pointed to one study that determined that about 2,000 children a year were hospitalized for opioid poisoning between 1997 and 2012, and \"a small number,\" about 30 each year, died while hospitalized.\n\nThe new report, however, puts the number of deaths per year at closer to 500. The new study's authors found that most deaths happened away from a medical setting, with 38% occurring in homes.\n\nThe researchers relied on data from death certificates, which they acknowledged might include some misclassifications of cause and manner of death.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut even with that possible limitation, they wrote, the problem for youth will likely grow \"unless legislators, public health officials, clinicians and parents take a wider view of the opioid crisis and implement protective measures that are pediatric-specific and family-centered.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Flu cases on the rise in the United States, CDC says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3C0IlvYtvbI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Flu activity is increasing in the United States, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.\n\nAs of the week ending December 22, nine states are experiencing high flu activity -- Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Carolina -- as well as New York City.

He said he didn't think it was a fair election but didn't want to be identified.\n\nIt wasn't hard to see why he felt intimidated. Outside every polling booth we went to, there were dozens of workers from the prime minister's party, listening intently when anyone was interviewed.

caption Monitoring blood pressure is part of the free health check\n\nFewer than half of people eligible for a NHS health check in England have taken up the offer, despite it being free to everyone over 40.\n\nThe routine check can pick up heart problems early and help to prevent dementia, plus highlight the need to stop smoking, NHS England said.\n\nThe check-up takes 20 minutes and is carried out by a GP or nurse.\n\nIt involves tests on blood pressure, weight and height, and is offered every five years up to the age of 74.\n\nAround 7.15 million people have had a free health check since 2013, yet 15 million are eligible, NHS stats show.\n\nNHS England said identifying people with an irregular heartbeat or high blood pressure and giving them treatment would help to prevent dangerous blood clots which could lead to strokes.\n\nAnd if more people went for their health check, the number of people having a stroke or other heart problems would reduce, potentially preventing thousands of cases of vascular dementia.\n\nWho can have an NHS health check?\n\nAnyone between the age of 40 and 74 who is generally healthy and doesn't already have any diseases.\n\nYou should automatically get an invitation through your GP surgery or local authority every five years.\n\nAfter the age of 74 you can request a health check-up from your GP or nurse.\n\nWhat problems can they spot?\n\nBy checking blood pressure, family history, lifestyle, height and weight, it is possible to give an idea of your risk of getting heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nResearch shows that people with a history of heart diseases are at least twice as likely to develop vascular dementia.\n\nYou will receive personalised advice on how to lower your risk of all those conditions, usually by:\n\nimproving your diet\n\ntaking more exercise\n\ntaking medicines to lower blood pressure or cholesterol\n\nlosing weight\n\nstopping smoking\n\nIf you are 65 or over, you will be told the signs and symptoms of dementia to look out for.\n\nWhy this could be a 'life-saving step'\n\nAlistair Burns, national clinical director for dementia and older people's mental health for NHS England said: \"Heart disease and dementia are two of the biggest health risks facing people in our country.\n\n\"Attending a free NHS health check is a great opportunity to discuss existing health conditions, and to work out how to reduce the risk of developing dementia and other illness in the future.\"\n\nHe said the start of a new year was the right time to commit to \"taking a simple, free and potentially life-saving step towards a healthier life\".\n\nPublic Health England said the check looked at the top causes of premature death and ill health and supported people to take action to reduce their risks.\n\nHave you taken up NHS health checks for over-40s?

And Ultima is further out in space even than the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.\n\nIt's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nHal Weaver, the JHU-APL project scientist on the mission, said the diminutive body was \"probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early Solar System\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New Horizons' chief scientist Alan Stern: \"It's pure science and pure exploration\"\n\nNew Horizons has been taking hundred of pictures of its quarry on approach. And although Ultima has appeared only as a faint dot in these images, the information gleaned from them has been critical in helping the mission team develop the navigation model that will be used to guide the probe through its encounter.\n\nBut they have also thrown up something of a puzzle: the light reflected off the object is much flatter than expected for a body that is anticipated to be irregular in shape and rotating.\n\nSeveral explanations for the lack of variation in the \"light curve\" have been proposed. One could simply be the geometry of the viewing angle; another is that Ultima is actually two or more objects moving about each other.\n\nThis latter possibility has long been a topic of speculation.\n\nWhy is New Horizons visiting Ultima Thule?\n\nNasa wanted to explore something beyond Pluto and this object was reachable.\n\nRemarkably, it was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nIt's a Latin phrase that means something like \"a place beyond the known world\".\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its size, it is likely to be composed of a lot of ice, dust and maybe some larger rock fragments, which came together at the dawn of the Solar System.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobate form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nDistant telescopic observations suggested its surface is very dark, with a bit of a red tinge. That darkness (it reflects only about 10% of the light falling on its surface) is the result of having been \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, rotation, composition and environment.\n\nScientists want to know how these far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the final hours of the flyby.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed. Features as small as 33m across should be discernible if the pointing of the cameras is spot on.\n\nBecause New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nThe \"hey, I'm healthy and I've got a treasure trove of data\" message should be picked up by Nasa's network of big radio dishes at 15:28 GMT.\n\nImage copyright NASA / JHUAPL / SWRI Image caption The detail in the highest resolution pictures should be better than New Horizons achieved at Pluto\n\nJust how big a challenge is this flyby?\n\nIn some ways, this event is more difficult than the pass of Pluto.\n\nThe object in the viewfinder is almost a hundred times smaller.\n\nNew Horizons will get closer than at Pluto, which is good for image detail; but it means that if the pointing is off, the probe could be sending back pictures of empty space!\n\nAnd this really is a major concern. Because Ultima was only discovered four years ago, its position and movement on the sky are much more uncertain than the coordinates for Pluto.\n\nHence the importance of the final timing commands uploaded to the spacecraft on Sunday.\n\nAnd, remember, all this is being done at a distance of 6.62 billion km (4.11 billion miles) from Earth.\n\nAt that separation, radio signals take six hours and eight minutes to reach home.\n\nWhat is more, the data rates are glacial - around 1,000 bits a second.\n\nIt will be late on Tuesday before the first of a few choice images in downlinked, and it will be September 2020 until every last scrap of data from the flyby is pulled off New Horizons.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: Indonesian volcano's dramatic collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46707731", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently\n\nThe scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear.\n\nResearchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea.\n\nThey say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week.\n\nMuch of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement.\n\nIt would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra.\n\nIndonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing.

We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade.\n\n\"Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.\"\n\nThe team hopes that making this reintroduction a success - and bringing back a bird that was on the very brink of extinction - will provide a powerful example, not just for how to save the most threatened species but how communities can support both people and wildlife in such valuable habitats, even in areas of significant poverty.\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau: How a tsunami could wipe out the last Javan rhinos", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46691120", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright WWF Image caption The entire species of Javan rhinos could be wiped out by a tsunami\n\nConservationists have warned that the entire species of the critically endangered Javan rhino could be wiped out if a tsunami were to strike again.\n\nThey once roamed the jungles of South East Asia and India, but today only 67 exist in the Ujung Kulon National Park, which was hit by last week's tsunami.\n\nThe park sits in the shadow of Anak Krakatau, the volcano which triggered waves that killed hundreds of people.\n\nThe volcano remains active and officials are now rushing to move them.\n\nTwo park officials were among the 430 killed by the tsunami, and numerous park buildings and ships were also destroyed when the tsunami hit last Saturday.\n\nBut the Javan rhinos left in the park - the only ones left in the world - were left unscathed.\n\nThe rhinos typically live along the park's south coast and this tsunami hit the north coast - many are keenly aware that the rhinos might not be so lucky if there is another disaster.\n\nAn entire species in danger\n\nThe Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species in the world - and have been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\n\nThey were once found in northeast India and across South East Asia but their population was quickly depleted as a result of poaching, habitat destruction through agriculture, among other factors.\n\nImage copyright Wwf Image caption Only 67 Javan rhinos exist today\n\nAccording to the WWF, Vietnam's last Javan rhino was poached in 2010.\n\n\"As there are no Javan rhinos in captivity anywhere in the world, should we lose this population, we've essentially lost the entire species,\" said Nicola Loweth, a WWF officer in a statement about the rhinos in Indonesia.\n\nThe search for the perfect location\n\nAnak Krakatau began showing increased signs of volcanic activity since June earlier this year.\n\nBut it was last Saturday that volcanic activity from Anak Krakatau is believed to have set off undersea landslides, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 430 people so far.\n\nAuthorities say Anak Krakatau is still active, and is in fact becoming increasingly active with what are known as Strombolian eruptions - short lived, explosive blasts of lava - being emitted.\n\n\"We understand that we cannot let the Javan rhinos live only in Ujung Julon,\" Widodo Sukohadi Ramono, chairman of the Rhino Foundation of Indonesian (YABI) told BBC News Indonesia.\n\nMr Ramono added that there were plans in place to move a smaller group of rhinos to a secondary location, though there was \"a lot [to be taken into] consideration\".\n\nThe rhinos which would be moved would have to be in good health, have close ties to each other and able to reproduce.\n\nBut moving the rhinos to another location is easier said than done.\n\nThe new location would have to have more than 200 species of plants - food sources for the Javan rhino. It would also need to have a plentiful water supply, an ideal soil type, land condition and a place with a year-round wet climate.\n\n\"It's difficult to find the perfect location... we need at least five thousand hectares in one location. It has to provide [the rhinos] with [suitable] food, water.

We need to do further studies on how the [sound] of guns and cannons could [impact] the rhinos.\"\n\nHuman activity also exists around the wildlife reserve - which could put the rhinos at risk.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A rhino footprint at the Ujung Kulon National Parl\n\nThe plan to move to the Cikepuh Wildlife Reserve appears to have stalled, but after the recent tsunami officials are once again moving with urgency.\n\n\"We [will] take more steps quickly in preparing a second habitat [for the rhinos],\" said Mr Mamat.\n\n\"If one day Ujung Kulon is hit by an eruption, then [we would hope] there would still be reserves [of Javan rhinos] in a new place.\"\n\nReporting by BBC Indonesia's Rivan Dwiastono.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Philippines Aims to Attract Investors Hit by Tariffs in Sino-US Trade War", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-sino-us-trade/4722477.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Vietnam has earned a name as the chief haven for multinationals hoping to avoid the Sino-U.S. trade dispute of 2018. The Philippines, another Southeast Asian country that has pushed to pick up foreign investment, aims to follow suit.\n\nThe Philippines boasts young workers skilled in English, quick infrastructure upgrades and a tax system overhaul \u2013 though fuel prices and periodic political unrest may check progress, people familiar with the country say.\n\nThe government approved $17.2 billion in investments, up 47 percent over 2017, the Board of Investments announced on December 24. Those figures \u201cblew past expectations,\u201d the board said.\n\n\u201cWe do have a market, a growing middle class and qualified workers, but there are economic and political factors that affect the level of confidence among investors, particularly foreign investors,\u201d said Maria Ela Atienza, political science professor at University of the Philippines Diliman.\n\nPerks in the Philippines\n\nThe Philippines would attract foreign investment in part because of its $169 billion infrastructure renewal, Atienza said. The rebuilding is set to run through 2022 and get funding partly by money from China and Japan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the additional financing they\u2019ve been offered is very helpful for them to develop their economy, and the Philippines knows it very much needs infrastructure development to become more competitive,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.\n\nThough too early to say, new infrastructure might help develop energy sources and lower electricity prices that otherwise deter investors, the professor said.\n\nMultinationals also consider the English language ability and other skills among workers, she said. Another sought-after skill: training in healthcare. Minimum wages for most manufacturers as well as in the service sectors will rise to $9.50 per day, on par with some of China\u2019s lower pay.\n\n\u201cThe workforce is still young, so whatever the needs of the new economy will be, the Philippines can provide, given its young workforce,\u201d said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist with Banco de Oro UniBank in Metro.\n\nA tax reform bill, if implemented in Manila, will lead to an \u201cinflux\u201d of investment in manufacturing, he said. He was referring to part two of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion, which would cut corporate income tax.\n\nThe Philippine Economic Zone Authority further helps secure investment by offering \u201cfacilitation,\u201d said Carl Baker, director of programs with Pacific Forum CSIS in Honolulu.\n\nChina, Japan try it out\n\nChina topped the list of foreign investors in the Philippines in 2018 with $927 million worth of commitments, up from just $10 million a year ago, the government board said. Like multinationals, companies in China are looking to other countries as an export base that will not trip U.S. tariffs.\n\nJapanese companies also expressed particular interest in the past year, Ravelas said.\n\nIn 2017, Seiko Epson opened a $143 million plant south of Manila. The plant will make projectors and inkjet printers. Around the same time, Shin-Etsu Magnetic Philippines, which produces magnets for electronic devices, opened its eighth plant in the country.\n\nForeign investors that produce exports in China face U.S. import tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods, one result of a trade dispute that consumed the past year. U.S. President Donald Trump regards China as an unfair trading partner.\n\nPhilippine officials have been drumming up support for foreign investment over the past half-decade as manufacturing costs rise in China.\n\nDeterrents to investment\n\nInvestors have kept away from the Philippines because of its archipelagic location \u2013 hard for transport \u2013 limits on foreign ownership, and utility rates.\n\nElectricity prices, a reflection of underlying energy costs, deter some investors as they top the rest of Southeast Asia except Singapore at $0.11 per kilowatt hour. Government officials are trying to develop new energy sources, including renewables, Ravelas noted. Foreign investors can own no more than 40% cap of land parcels, Philippine-based corporations or public utilities.\n\nPhilippine workers are more likely to be unionized than in other Asian countries, Atienza said. They tend to be \u201cmore vocal\u201d in demands for higher pay compared to other Southeast Asian countries, she added.\n\nLocalized violence that may erupt ahead of midterm elections in May as well as the government\u2019s struggle against Communist rebels in the countryside could put off hopeful investors, she said.\n\nAmong south and Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines will \u201cgain the least\u201d from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, investment bank Natixis said in a research report December 4. It cites \u201cexpensive\u201d electricity and \u201cweak\u201d business infrastructure.\n\nVietnam has earned a name through cheap land and labor, government openness to foreign investment and a growing list of free trade agreements. \u201cThere is significant competition from other ASEAN countries for attracting investors looking for an alternative to China-based manufacturing,\u201d Baker said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Origin of Virus That Hobbled US Newspapers Still Unclear", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/origin-of-virus-that-hobbled-us-newspapers-still-unclear/4722440.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "The origins of a suspected computer attack that disrupted the Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing newspapers remained unclear Sunday after causing delivery delays and being brought to the attention of federal investigators.\n\nSan Diego Union-Tribune Publisher Jeff Light described the incident as \u201cwhat now seems to have been a malicious attack on the company by computer hackers\u201d in a message posted to the newspaper's website.

Nearby was a small pair of rubber boots, sized to fit an 8-year-old.\n\nTaped to the wall were three photos, alternately smiling and serious, bearing a simple epitaph for the boy whose memory the makeshift altar honored: \u201cFelipe Gomez Alonzo. Died Dec. 24 2018 in New Mexico, United States.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Felipe became the second Guatemalan child this month to die while in U.S. custody near the Mexican border. The deaths prompted widespread criticism of President Donald Trump, who has foisted blame on Democrats even as his Homeland Security secretary vowed additional health screenings for detained migrant children.\n\nIn the boy's village of Yalambojoch, in western Guatemala, the political fallout in the United States seemed a world away and there was only deep sadness over his death. Relatives said they had no idea that such a tragedy could occur. Nor had they heard about U.S. policies that led to thousands of migrant children being separated from their parents earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe don't have a television. We don't have a radio,\u201d said Catarina Gomez, Felipe's sister. \u201cWe didn't know what had happened before.\u201d\n\nThe hamlet, set on a plain and surrounded by spectacular, pine-covered mountains, is a place of crushing poverty and lack of opportunity, home to a single small school, dirt roads that become impassible during the rainy season and rudimentary homes without insulation, proper flooring, water or electricity.\n\nThe community is populated by families who fled to Mexico during the bloodiest years of Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war but returned after the signing of peace accords. There are no jobs, and people live off meager subsistence farming and local commerce. Residents say the Guatemalan government has turned a blind eye to their plight, a complaint that can be heard in other impoverished villages in the country.\n\nFelipe's sister, Catarina, said that in recent years \u201ceveryone started heading for the United States,\u201d so much so that a local project to boost education financed with Swedish help was abandoned because there were practically no more young people to take the classes.\n\nIt was extreme poverty and lack of opportunity that drove Felipe's father, Agustin Gomez, to decide that he and the boy would set off for the United States. Others from the community had been able to cross the U.S. border with children, and he figured they would have the same luck. Felipe was chosen because he was the oldest son. It didn't occur to anyone that the journey could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cI didn't think of that, because several families had already left and they made it,\u201d the boy's mother, Catarina Alonzo said, speaking in the indigenous Chuj language as her stepdaughter translated into Spanish.\n\nFelipe was healthy when they left, according to the family. The last time he spoke with his mother was a day before they were taken into detention by border agents. Felipe told her he was well, that he had eaten chicken, that the next time they talked would be by phone from the United States.\n\n\n\nInstead, the call that came Christmas Day was from her husband, who said Felipe had died the day before.\n\nThe two had been apprehended a week earlier, on Dec. 18, near the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso, Texas, to Juarez, Mexico, according to border officials. Father and son were held at the bridge's processing center and then the Border Patrol station in El Paso before being transferred on Dec. 23 to a facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away.\n\nAfter an agent noticed Felipe coughing, father and son were taken to an Alamogordo hospital, where Felipe was found to have a 103-degree fever (39.4 degrees Celsius), officials have said.\n\nFelipe was held for observation for 90 minutes, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, before being released with prescriptions for amoxicillin and ibuprofen.\n\nBut the boy fell sick hours later and was admitted to the hospital on Christmas Eve. He died just before midnight.\n\nNew Mexico authorities said late Thursday that an autopsy showed Felipe had the flu, but more tests need to be done before a cause of death can be determined.\n\nThe other Guatemalan child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, died Dec. 8 in El Paso. She showed signs of sepsis, a potentially fatal condition brought on by infection, according to officials.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump claimed that Felipe and Jakelin were \u201cvery sick\u201d before they reached the border and sought to pin blame for their deaths on Democrats, though both young migrants passed initial health screenings by Border Patrol.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said last week that prior to this month, no child had died in the agency's custody in more than a decade.\n\nOn Sunday he called for a \u201cmultifaceted solution\u201d on immigration, including not only better border security and new immigration laws but more aid to the Central American countries the migrants are fleeing from.\n\nReferring to the U.S. pledge earlier this month of $5.8 billion in development aid for Central America, McAleenan called it \u201ca tremendous step forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are green shoots of progress both on security and the economic front in Central America. We need to foster that and help improve the opportunities to stay at home,\u201d he said on ABC's \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nOutside the Gomez family home in Yalambojoch, women gathered wearing lavender skirts in the intricate patterns typical of indigenous garb in Guatemala. Colorful tapestries hung on a clothesline above the muddy yard.\n\nTaped to the door were a pair of Felipe's artworks. One was a rendering of a blue balloon with a green string; in the other, a white horse jumped over a fence against a yellow sun and tangerine sky.\n\nAmong the villagers grieving Felipe's death was his 7-year-old best friend, Kevin. Two days before Felipe and his dad left, the two boys quarreled.\n\n\u201cThey were crying because they had fought,\u201d said Felipe's sister, Catarina.\n\nBy the time Kevin came back to look for his friend, he had left for the United States. Kevin now knows that Felipe has died, the family said.\n\nTrying to fight back tears, Catarina Alonzo said her son promised before leaving that when he was grown, he would work to send money home. Felipe also wanted to buy her a cellphone so she could see pictures of him from afar.\n\nNow she hopes for only two things: That Felipe's body is returned as soon as possible for burial, and that her husband can remain in the United States to work off debt and support their other kids.\n\nThe Guatemalan Consulate in Phoenix has said that Agustin Gomez was released on a humanitarian license allowing him to remain in the United States for now. Felipe's body is expected to be sent back to Guatemala around mid-January."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Top US Senator Upbeat on Syria Troop Withdrawal After Trump Meeting", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-senator-upbeat-on-syria-troop-withdrawal-after-trump-meeting/4722032.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "A senior Republican U.S. senator said he emerged from a White House meeting with President Donald Trump on Sunday reassured that Trump is committed to defeating Islamic State even as he plans to withdraw American troops from Syria.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham had warned that removing all U.S. forces from Syria would hurt national security by allowing Islamic State to rebuild, betraying U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters of the YPG militia battling remnants of the militant group, and enhancing Iran's ability to threaten Israel.\n\nDuring a morning television interview, Graham said he would ask Trump to slow down the troop withdrawal, which was announced earlier this month and drew widespread criticism.\n\nAn ally of Trump, although he has opposed some of his foreign policy decisions, Graham was more upbeat after the meeting.\n\n\"We talked about Syria.

Leaders of a national campaign to ban the practice are hopeful that at least four more states \u2014 Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 will join the ranks in the upcoming legislative sessions.\n\n\n\n\"We'd be disappointed if we don't get those this year \u2014 they're overdue,\" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups campaigning to impose bans in all 50 states.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has gained momentum in recent months thanks to the national release of two films dramatizing the experiences of youths who went through conversion therapy \u2014 The Miseducation of Cameron Post and the higher-profile Boy Erased starring Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.\n\nJoining 'in droves'\n\nSam Brinton of the Trevor Project, another of groups leading the ban campaign, said thousands of people have signed up to assist the effort since Boy Erased was released on Nov. 2.\n\n\n\n\"They're recognizing this is still a problem and joining our campaigns in droves,\" said Brinton, a child of Baptist missionary parents who has written about agonizing conversion therapy sessions experienced as an adolescent in Florida.\n\n\n\nBrinton recalls being bound to a table by the therapist for applications of ice, heat and electricity.\n\n\n\nJust four days after the Boy Erased release came the midterm elections, which altered the partisan political dynamic at several statehouses and boosted prospects for conversion therapy bans.\n\nIn three of the states now being targeted, previous efforts to enact a ban gained some bipartisan support but were thwarted by powerful Republicans. In Maine, a bill was vetoed last year by GOP Gov. Paul LePage. In New York and Colorado, bills approved in the Democratic-led lower chambers of the legislature died in the Republican-controlled state senates.\n\n\n\nIn January, however, a Democrat will succeed LePage as Maine's governor, and Democrats will have control of both legislative chambers in New York and in Colorado, where gay Gov.-elect Jared Polis is believed eager to sign a ban.\n\nA lead sponsor of the New York ban bill, Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman, predicted passage would be \"straightforward\" now that his party controls the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"For a lot of my colleagues, they consider conversion therapy to be child abuse,\" he said.\n\nOutlook in Massachusetts\n\n\n\nIn Massachusetts, both legislative chambers voted last year in support of a ban but were unable to reconcile different versions of the measure before adjournment. Chances of passage in 2019 are considered strong, and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who was re-elected, is viewed as likely to sign such a measure given his strong support for LGBT rights.\n\n\n\nMore Republican governors like Baker are getting behind the bans, reflecting activists' belief that opposition to conversion therapy is increasingly bipartisan.\n\n\n\nBills proposing bans are pending or anticipated in several GOP-controlled legislatures, including Florida, Ohio and Utah. LGBT activists are particularly intrigued by Utah because of the possibility that the powerful Mormon church, which in the past supported conversion therapy, might endorse a bill to ban the practice for minors.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, the proposed ban faces long odds in the legislature in 2019, but activists note that about 20 Florida cities and counties have passed local bans \u2014 more than in any other state.\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, supporters of a bill that would ban conversion therapy for minors realize they have an uphill fight in a legislature with GOP supermajorities.\n\n\n\nStill, Sen. Charleta Tavares, a Columbus Democrat, believes her proposal got \"new legs\" in November. That's when the state board overseeing counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists warned the 40,000 professionals it regulates that anyone found practicing conversion therapy on LGBT patients could lose his or her license.\n\n\n\n\"I am glad to see that our state boards are carrying this movement, regardless of the inaction by our General Assembly,\" Tavares said.\n\n\n\nFor now, LGBT activists are not seeking to ban conversion therapy for adults. A gay California legislator, Evan Low, withdrew a bill he introduced earlier this year that would have declared conversion therapy a fraudulent practice and banned commercial use of it for adults and minors. Some opponents had threatened to sue to block the bill, saying it would jeopardize free speech and free exercise of religion.\n\n\u200bModel for movie\n\n\n\nLow says he may try again after revising his bill. If so, his arguments could be bolstered by input from John Smid, the real-life model for the Boy Erased character who ran a coercive conversion therapy program.\n\n\n\nFor years, Smid was director of Tennessee-based Love in Action, a ministry that operated such a program. Smid left the organization in 2008. He subsequently renounced the concept that sexual orientation could be changed and apologized for any harm he had caused. In 2014, he married his same-sex partner, with whom he lives in Texas.\n\n\n\nSmid recently cooperated with a law firm as it compiled a report about Love in Action for the Washington-based Mattachine Society, which studies past instances of anti-LGBT persecution.\n\n\n\nOne of the report's co-authors, Lisa Linsky, said Smid depicted Love in Action as \"a complete and utter failure,\" with none of its participants actually changing sexual orientation."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Nigeria Targets 26 Million People in Yellow Fever Prevention Campaign", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4722520.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Nigeria's campaign to vaccinate more people against yellow fever appears to be making headway.

This year, as of Dec. 11, 22 abortion restrictions were passed nationwide \u2014 a number that will likely edge up to 24 by the time 2019 begins.\n\nOn the surface, that number looks pretty good. It\u2019s the fewest abortion restrictions passed in a single year in more than a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and promotes reproductive health policy. And for the first time in recent years, the number of proactive reproductive health policies \u2014 measures that make it easier for women to access abortion services and birth control, for example \u2014 outpaced the number of restrictions.\n\nAnd yet ... the laws that legislators pushed through in 2018 and the rhetoric they used were extreme and aggressive in ways that deeply unsettled reproductive rights advocates, said Elizabeth Nash, the senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, particularly given the Supreme Court\u2019s new conservative majority. Furthermore, new laws don\u2019t tell the full picture as some states tried to resurrect old anti-abortion legislation with that new conservative majority mind.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw this year was a lower number of enacted restrictions,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut some of these are so extreme that it\u2019s a shift in the type of restrictions we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s not captured in the pure number.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how anti-abortion legislators targeted abortion access in 2018.\n\nThey instituted restrictions that make it really hard \u2014 often impossible \u2014 for women to get abortions within a legal time frame\n\nThe most extreme abortion restriction of 2018 came out of Iowa, which banned abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected \u2014 at around six weeks gestation \u2014 except in cases of rape or incest or if the woman\u2019s life is at risk.\n\nSix weeks is so early in a pregnancy that a woman might not know she\u2019s pregnant yet; the law bans abortion before many women even realize they\u2019ve missed a period. And even if they know they\u2019re pregnant before six weeks, it leaves virtually no time for them to find an abortion provider, book an appointment, come up with the money they need and tackle any of the many other logistical hurdles women must contend with.\n\nCutting off access to abortion at a certain point in pregnancy is nothing new, Nash said, but the drive to do it earlier and earlier is a shift toward the extreme. In past years, states focused on banning abortions at 20 weeks gestation, or about the halfway point in a woman\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 not in the first few weeks.\n\nThat Iowa law is tied up in the courts, meaning it is not in effect, but Ohio came close to enacting a similar bill, which Gov. John Kasich vetoed just before Christmas. Likewise, Mississippi is one of two states that passed a ban on most abortions after the 15-week mark. It too has been blocked by the courts, but the state\u2019s attorney general has said he will appeal.\n\n\u201cIn some states that already have so many restrictions on the books, all that is left is to ban abortion,\u201d Nash argued. \u201cThey\u2019ve restricted access to the extent that\u2019s possible, so now the next big leap is an early abortion ban.\u201d\n\nThey played on concerns about discrimination in order to stigmatize women who seek abortions\n\nIn the fall, Indiana\u2019s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to overrule two previous court decisions blocking a 2016 state law that, among other things, barred women from getting an abortion based on the race or gender of a fetus or in cases in which a fetus has a disability.\n\nThat sort of legislation falls under the broad umbrella of what Nash called \u201creason bans,\u201d which prohibit women from terminating a pregnancy based on things like sex or race. Anti-abortion legislators argue they\u2019re solely meant to prohibit discrimination, but reproductive rights advocates call BS. They say they\u2019re nothing more than an effort to further limit abortion access while fueling stigma by legally requiring doctors to question their patients\u2019 motives.\n\nLast year Ohio\u2019s governor signed a similar bill that would make it a felony for doctors to perform an abortion for any woman whose fetus has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. Some parents of children with Down syndrome have supported the measure, while others have criticized what they see as a bad faith effort from anti-abortion lawmakers. For now, it too is tied up in court.\n\n\u201cIf [legislators] really cared about making the community better for my daughter, they\u2019d provide more funding for programs that help her. They\u2019d help improve inclusion in schools. They\u2019d help educate parents that Down syndrome doesn\u2019t have to be scary,\u201d one woman told HuffPost last March. \u201cI have a whole bunch of issues I would love to have legislators\u2019 help with.\u201d\n\nThey used gruesome, imprecise language to paint a safe and common method of abortion as cruel and barbaric\n\nBans on dilation and evacuation procedures, one of the most common ways doctors perform second-trimester abortions, gained traction once again in 2018. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said D&Es, as they\u2019re often called, are a safe way to remove the contents of the uterus and can be done as an outpatient surgery with general or regional anesthesia \u2014 but legislators have used inflammatory language painting it as a barbarous act.\n\nFor example, in Kentucky, which passed a 2018 ban on D&E abortions, a bill didn\u2019t say \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d anywhere. Instead, it banned procedures that cause \u201cbodily dismemberment,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201chuman vivisection.\u201d And that rhetoric, Nash said, represents a real shift.\n\n\u201cThe language isn\u2019t about protecting health or fetal rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe language is simply trying to paint the procedure as something dangerous, something terrible that no one would ever want to undergo. And oh, by the way, it would make it very hard if not impossible to access abortion after 15 weeks, so that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nThey wrote laws they knew would be challenged in court in a big and public way, with the goal of toppling Roe v. Wade\n\nFor Nash, perhaps the most worrisome shift of 2018 was the ramping up of likely unconstitutional legislation aimed at drawing lawsuits, with the hope those cases will eventually land in front of the Supreme Court and test Roe v. Wade. Donald Trump said while campaigning for the presidency that he believed the landmark decision would be overturned \u201cautomatically\u201d because it was his intention to put several conservative judges on the Supreme Court. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on abortion rights, retired in June, and now two of Trump\u2019s appointees sit on the court.\n\n\u201cYou have states across the country that are essentially lining up with prefiled abortion bans,\u201d Nash said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Trauma Is The Norm For Many New Orleans Kids.

Their creations line the walls of the art and electives room. In the adjacent hallway, bright blue plywood covers the spots where students punched or kicked holes in the drywall as they passed between classes.\n\nThis is the middle school campus for the New Orleans Center for Resilience, a nonprofit K\u20138 school with two locations in the city. The 27 kids enrolled in the center\u2019s program have some of the most extreme behavior needs in the city, often stemming from trauma or mental illness. A typical student may have exhibited verbal and physical aggression, caused property damage or refused to do classwork. It\u2019s a place for kids who have almost nowhere else to turn \u2014 when they\u2019ve been asked or told to leave their previous schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of the kids who are referred here have experienced significant complex trauma,\u201d said Liz Marcell Williams, the center\u2019s director. \u201cWhether they themselves have been victims of trauma or they\u2019re exposed to violence in the home or in the community or have experienced significant loss of a loved one due to long-term incarceration or death.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans, a high-poverty, high-crime city, has particularly pressing needs when it comes to trauma and behavioral health.\n\nA survey of about 1,200 New Orleans kids ages 10 to 16, released in 2015, found that nearly 40 percent had witnessed domestic violence, a shooting, a stabbing or a beating. About 18 percent reported witnessing a murder. And more than half said that someone close to them had been murdered.\n\nThe survey found that children in New Orleans displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at more than three times the national average.\n\nThe center, which was known as the Therapeutic Day Program until Dec. 1, is a rare lifeline to the few who get in. When it opened in 2015, it was the first school of its kind in New Orleans, offering a blend of traditional classes like math and English, as well as therapy and counseling. In a city where student mental health resources remain scant, there are few places like it today.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Misty Johnson does a warm-up activity with Jordan Coughlin, a math teacher at the Center for Resilience.\n\nKids who arrive at the center are usually three grade levels behind in math and reading, said Williams, who has a background in special education and designed the school\u2019s curriculum. Her goal is to get kids back into the mainstream school system. Students attend the center for an average of 15 months.\n\nNine-year-old Misty Johnson, who has ADHD and bipolar disorder, has been in the program for two years. Her mom, Dawn Johnson, said Misty is almost ready to return to a charter elementary school.\n\nJohnson admitted that she was worried when she first visited the center. \u201cThe other kids were just like Misty,\u201d she said, adding that she thought it might be overwhelming for her daughter.\n\nOver time, however, she saw improvements in Misty\u2019s behavior and academics. Many of the classes here are tiny; some have just two students. Misty was getting lots of one-on-one attention. The school called Johnson regularly to give updates.\n\nThis year the center started assigning students a home base room, where they begin their day with breakfast. The home base is meant to be a safe room, and students may return there during the day if they need to opt out of a class or activity. In a typical school, students don\u2019t usually have the option to walk out of class if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\nL. Kasimu Harris for HuffPost Abel Thompson, a second-grader, displays his newly crafted Santa Claus beard. In addition to academic offerings, various activities \u2014 from sports to play to art \u2014 are integrated into a school day at the Center for Resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about how do we minimize power struggles,\u201d Williams said. The home base room really helped them with that, she added. From August to November last year, the center had 235 behavioral incidents requiring an adult crisis response, she said. This year in the same time frame, there were 77. The home base rooms were partly responsible for that, she said.\n\nDespite the high rate of turnover at the center, most kids who apply for a spot at the tiny school never get in.\n\nOnly 45 kids have attended since the school opened. Erin LaFleur wanted her 14-year-old son, Brady, to be one of them. He has bipolar disorder, autism and Down syndrome and spent time in a state-run facility that was several hours away by car. She fought long and hard to navigate the New Orleans public school system for him, and she said she thought the center\u2019s day program would be a perfect fit.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t get in.\n\nHe lacked the verbal communication and social skills necessary for the program, a rejection letter stated.\n\n\u201cIt would benefit children with intellectual disabilities who have behavior disorders if [the center] accepted them,\u201d LaFleur said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "He Hawks Young Blood As A New Miracle Treatment.

Teen donors, vampiric undertones, a serious-sounding study, an $8,000-per-person price tag and rumors that venture capitalist Peter Thiel might be interested earned Ambrosia more than 100 press mentions in just two years.\n\nThe effects of young plasma, Karmazin told reporters, were astounding. Just one infusion \u201cdramatically improves people\u2019s appearance, their memory and their strength,\u201d he told one reporter. \u201cI want to be clear, at this point, it works. It reverses aging,\u201d he told another. \u201cI\u2019m not really in the camp of saying this will provide immortality but I think it comes pretty close,\u201d he told a third, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like plastic surgery from the inside out.\u201d\n\nThe free publicity helped Ambrosia attract clients: One hundred and four people paid to receive plasma from 16- to 25-year-old donors as part of Ambrosia\u2019s participant-funded study, Karmazin told HuffPost.\n\nBut despite declaring the study a success and announcing plans this week to accept new clients, Karmazin never showed any proof that the transfusions actually helped people. In the media, he touted impressive results, but almost a year after his study officially concluded in January 2018, he hasn\u2019t released them. Scientists have criticized the study as flawed and the procedure as medically unnecessary and not without risk; in rare cases, transfusion complications can be fatal. One of the doctors Karmazin hired had previously been disciplined by a state medical board for unprofessional conduct. Karmazin himself cannot legally practice medicine in any state; he is explicitly prohibited from practicing in Massachusetts by authorities. Ambrosia\u2019s president and chief operating officer quietly left the company in late December, leaving Karmazin as the sole employee. And the only patient who spoke publicly about Ambrosia\u2019s transfusions \u2014 treatments he hoped would help him live healthier into old age \u2014 died at 65 after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nKarmazin couldn\u2019t comment on individual patients but said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment.\n\n[People] could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment. Phuoc Le, physician and global health specialist\n\nHuffPost found that at least some of Karmazin\u2019s young plasma came from a nonprofit blood bank in Texas that recruited teenage donors for \u201csaving lives,\u201d but noted on a consent form that their blood components could also be used for \u201cany other medical purpose.\u201d\n\nThe bank abruptly decided to stop selling young plasma after HuffPost reached out, according to an employee email.\n\nAmbrosia, which declined to comment on whether the company has any investors, is only one of many firms investigating how to help people feel younger for longer. But Ambrosia\u2019s ability to attract paying clients and years of positive press coverage \u2014 without providing scientific data to back up its claims \u2014 shows just how easy it can be for promises to outpace the research when Silicon Valley gold-chasing mixes with Americans\u2019 fear of death.\n\n\u201cYou can easily imagine a situation where somebody who\u2019s vulnerable, and not wealthy, and not healthy, and may be desperate ... would potentially feel like they have no option but to spend this money,\u201d said Phuoc Le, a physician and global health specialist who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey could literally spend their life savings on an unproven treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctor Karmazin\n\nKarmazin was born in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and attended Princeton University, where he became a highly accomplished rower, going on to win a silver medal in the Paralympic Games in Beijing in 2008. He attended Stanford Medical School and participated in labs that focused on longevity and stem cell biology. His experience as an athlete \u2014 and feeling slower athletically after turning 30 \u2014 influenced his desire to work on aging as a treatable condition. After graduating in 2014, Karmazin started a residency at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston with a plan to eventually specialize in psychiatry. But as Karmazin tells it, he didn\u2019t like working the long hours and felt he didn\u2019t have time to pursue his other interests, transfusions and aging, in addition to general practice, so he left his residency in 2016 to start Ambrosia.\n\nThere is an asterisk to that story: On Feb. 29, 2016, Karmazin and his attorney signed a voluntary agreement with Massachusetts officials in which he promised to immediately stop practicing medicine in the state. Karmazin told HuffPost he signed the paperwork because he left his residency early, that doing so was \u201cpretty routine,\u201d there were no additional circumstances that he was aware of and that\u2019s all he knew. That account seems unlikely. Karmazin was practicing under a limited license; such a license terminates automatically if a physician leaves a residency program early for any reason, according to George Zachos, the executive director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine. The board wouldn\u2019t typically pursue such an agreement with a limited licensee for leaving a residency early, Zachos said. Such a public agreement is used to protect patient safety. Last year, only 12 physicians in Massachusetts reached similar deals.\n\nThe board\u2019s review is confidential, but a representative noted the circumstances that led to the agreement were unrelated to Karmazin\u2019s work with Ambrosia or xVitality Sciences, a separate \u201crejuvenation\u201d project he also worked on.\n\nKarmazin, who introduces himself as \u201cDr. Karmazin,\u201d moved forward with Ambrosia after signing that agreement. He said he got the idea for young plasma transfusions from several studies in which young and old mice were surgically conjoined in order to examine the effects of mixing their blood. In some cases, the older mice became temporarily stronger and showed slight improvements to their health. Karmazin believed those results could be replicated in humans.\n\nMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood, but there is no scientific evidence for that. Irina Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nScientists have questioned Karmazin\u2019s interpretation of the data. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who led conjoined-mice tests noticed small positive changes in older animals\u2019 muscles, livers and brains. But the more important finding was the significant decline in the health of the younger animals. For the older animals, the young blood was largely diluted by the old blood.\n\n\u201cThere was much more negative effect from the stuff in the old blood than there was positive effect from the stuff in the young blood,\u201d said Irina Conboy, an aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley, who compared young blood transfusions to taking \u201ca pile of rotten bananas\u201d and throwing \u201cone good one\u201d on top. \u201cMaybe there are secret sources [for human rejuvenation] in young blood,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is no scientific evidence for that.\u201d\n\nKarmazin went ahead anyway: In the summer of 2016, he announced that he would charge people ages 35 and older $8,000 each for about 2 liters of young plasma as part of what he called a \u201cclinical trial.\u201d Karmazin didn\u2019t feel the need to go through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s drug approval process, as plasma transfusions are already a well-established procedure. Most of the time, however, they are used to treat patients who have specific health issues, not carried out to potentially make people feel younger.\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial whipped up the flurry of press coverage that doubled as free advertising, and in some cases, suggested inaccurately that people were drinking young blood. But what really got people talking about Ambrosia was a report that Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur billionaire, was interested in young blood. Karmazin himself appears to have made the explicit connection to Ambrosia. In 2016, he told an Inc. magazine reporter that Jason Camm, chief medical officer at Thiel Capital, had contacted him to express interest in Ambrosia. It\u2019s not clear whether Camm was reaching out on Thiel\u2019s behalf, or how extensive the alleged contact was. But the story prompted a wave of Thiel-vampire insinuations in the media. Later, in an interview with TechCrunch, Karmazin completely denied having contact with anyone from Thiel Capital, raising questions about who wanted to quash the story.\n\nCamm and Thiel Capital did not respond to requests for comment. In November, Thiel said at the New York Times DealBook conference: \u201cOn the record. I\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d He also said he\u2019s never injected himself with young blood. Karmazin reiterated to HuffPost that he\u2019s not in any contact with Thiel. When asked why his story appears to have changed, Karmazin repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nSweet Little 16-Year-Old Plasma\n\nTo launch his study, Karmazin needed plasma, the liquid part of blood, from young people. He needed a lot of it \u2014 Ambrosia performed more than 150 roughly 2-liter transfusions (some clients reportedly returned for multiple treatments), according to Karmazin, which would have required at least 80 gallons of young plasma, hundreds of donations\u2019 worth. But he faced a hitch: Blood banks don\u2019t typically separate out blood plasma by age and sell it for rejuvenation purposes; their primary mission is to provide donated blood for hospital patients and save lives.\n\nWhen blood centers have unused plasma, they commonly provide it to different companies in order to make products to treat serious medical conditions such as hemophilia, according to a spokesperson for AABB, a nonprofit that accredits blood centers.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to find a blood bank willing to supply a startup for Karmazin\u2019s purposes. In the beginning, Karmazin called some 20 blood banks, he said. It \u201ctook a while to find the right partner,\u201d he added. There was interest, he claimed, but banks didn\u2019t have a process in place to get him the plasma he needed. HuffPost contacted more than a dozen U.S. blood banks, many of which cited ethical concerns and raised questions about Ambrosia\u2019s study. The chief medical and scientific officer of Vitalant, a nonprofit that distributes blood to more than 1,000 U.S. hospitals, told HuffPost that Vitalant leadership contacted all its donation centers after hearing about Ambrosia to confirm none worked with the company. Ambrosia\u2019s study didn\u2019t seem to be a legitimate clinical trial, Dr. Ralph Vassallo said, so Vitalant shouldn\u2019t be selling to the startup.\n\nEventually, Karmazin said, he found two blood banks to provide the company with \u201cexcess\u201d young plasma that he could use for his study. Karmazin refused to say which ones they were.\n\nEmmanuel Polanco for HuffPost\n\nDeep In The Heart Of Texas\n\nOne of his partners for Ambrosia\u2019s trial was the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a subsidiary of BioBridge Global, a nonprofit headquartered in San Antonio.\n\nSTBTC has lamented \u201ccritical\u201d blood supply shortages and called on millennials to \u201cstep up and donate.\u201d It has sent blood collection buses to schools and asks students on its website: \u201cAre you up for saving lives?\u201d It holds a donation competition for local high schools called \u201cGeneration Give\u201d with $750 top prizes, and has offered incentives to donors such as free movie tickets and amusement park passes. Students who have donated six blood products or more \u201chave made the difference in the lives of over 18 hospital patients,\u201d STBTC states on its website. Honored students receive a special red cord to wear at their high school graduation ceremony.\n\nThe South Texas blood bank\u2019s main mission is to provide blood to approximately 100 hospitals and clinics, Elizabeth Waltman, STBTC\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement. But \u201cafter community needs are met, and to ensure no donated blood is wasted, we provide blood where it is needed, including to support research that will advance medical care,\u201d she added. Ambrosia\u2019s study met STBTC\u2019s requirements for research-related use of their blood components, she said.\n\nSTBTC did not comment on whether it sold donations that came through Generation Give as young plasma. But its consent forms for blood donors \u201cclearly state\u201d that donations will be used to serve \u201cboth clinical and research purposes,\u201d Waltman said. HuffPost reviewed a copy of STBTC\u2019s 1,200-word student consent form, which requires kids and parents to acknowledge that donated blood may be used to help patients \u201cor for any other medical purpose.\u201d The form praises students for \u201cgiving the gift of life.\u201d\n\nThe Trial\n\nBy the fall of 2016, Karmazin was ready to launch his study.\n\nAmbrosia told trial participants that \u201cabundant data\u201d from mice studies suggested young plasma infusions could help with \u201crejuvenation,\u201d but the company said it couldn\u2019t guarantee participants any specific results, such as the treatment of a disease. Rather, it noted in its informed consent form that there are \u201cno known improvements\u201d directly related to young plasma infusions. In fact, the form contained \u201can appalling lack of detailed explanation of what the actual effects of this intervention are supposed to be,\u201d said Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who reviewed Ambrosia\u2019s form at HuffPost\u2019s request.\n\nKarmazin contracted physicians to carry out the young plasma transfusions at clinics in San Francisco; Monterey, California; and Tampa, Florida. The Monterey-based doctor, David Wright, had been publicly reprimanded by the Medical Board of California in 2015 for charges that included gross negligence related to diagnosing a patient with a chronic tick-borne infection without an adequate basis, and then using a medically unsupported treatment \u2015 daily antibiotic infusion therapy \u2015 that led to significant side effects. Wright did not admit to wrongdoing in the agreement; the reprimand did not preclude him from practicing medicine.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said one director of transfusion medicine. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm.\u201d\n\nThen-New Scientist writer Sally Adee traveled to Monterey to cover Ambrosia\u2019s trial in 2017 and reported that a patient who came from Russia had an anaphylactic reaction after a transfusion. Wright was \u201cvisibly shaken\u201d after the incident, Adee wrote.\n\nAmbrosia ultimately reported four adverse incidents during the trial, according to Barbara Krutchkoff, the executive director of the Institute of Regenerative and Cellular Medicine, a small nonprofit that houses an institutional review board that oversaw the study. They included a rash in March 2017, a runny nose and cold symptoms in April, hives and edema in June, and itchiness in December. All were considered mild allergic reactions and resolved, she said.\n\nAmbrosia was fortunate there weren\u2019t more adverse reactions, said Le, the physician and global health specialist.\n\n\u201cIn general, somebody who does not need a blood transfusion would be at great risk for all sorts of things, short term and long term,\u201d said Le, who was alarmed that Ambrosia claimed to give patients about 2 liters of plasma over just one to two days.\n\n\u201cFor patients with true indications, plasma transfusion can be lifesaving,\u201d said Robertson Davenport, director of transfusion medicine at the University of Michigan. But doing this procedure for anti-aging purposes is \u201cnot scientifically or medically justified and exposes patients to risk of harm,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the study, Karmazin and Wright had a falling-out. They disagreed over Karmazin\u2019s plans to transfuse smaller amounts of young plasma over a shorter period of time \u2014 a change Wright deemed risky, according to the New Scientist article. \u201cWe just had different ideas for what this treatment could become,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. Wright stopped working for Ambrosia before the study was complete.\n\nWright did not respond to several calls and emailed requests for comment. When HuffPost sent a reporter to his new office in Pacific Grove, his receptionist threatened to call the police.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s Still No Data\u2019\n\nAmbrosia\u2019s trial formally ended in January 2018. It was a great success, according to Karmazin, with about one-third of the participants returning to purchase additional treatments and around 150 treatments delivered in all. Some people continued to receive transfusions as late as this past summer, he said.\n\nBy the end of the trial, Ambrosia had been touting findings for months. Karmazin claimed to Canada\u2019s National Post, for example, that an early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s patient showed improvements with one treatment and a person in their 60s saw their graying hair turn darker. He told New Scientist that he saw a 10 percent decrease in patients\u2019 blood cholesterol levels, and told Boss Magazine there were \u201creally dramatic improvements\u201d to biomarkers for inflammation.\n\n[Ambrosia] seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money. Michael Conboy, aging and rejuvenation researcher\n\nThe company said it tested patients\u2019 blood for more than 100 biomarkers before and after the transfusions, looking for improvements in markers for aging and disease. Ambrosia\u2019s study did not have a control group that received a placebo. And a change in a biomarker isn\u2019t necessarily proof of a change in actual health status, noted Charo, the University of Wisconsin-Madison professor. Such changes must be matched to \u201creal health outcomes,\u201d which requires long-term follow-up. Karmazin said patients wrote diaries, and that some later volunteered additional health data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how Ambrosia\u2019s was set up as a clinical trial,\u201d said Michael Conboy, husband and research partner of Irina Conboy, the aging and rejuvenation researcher at Berkeley. \u201cIt seemed to me that it was set up as more of a \u2018fee for service\u2019 type thing and the \u2018trial\u2019 part was slapped on to legitimize it. It seemed to be starting off as someone capitalizing on the hype and trying to make some money.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still no public data. Karmazin shared some \u201cpreliminary results that he was excited about\u201d with his hired institutional review board, Krutchkoff said, but she hadn\u2019t seen the final results. Speaking to HuffPost with Karmazin\u2019s permission, Krutchkoff praised Karmazin\u2019s professionalism and brushed off criticisms of the study. \u201cAs controversial as this study was, there\u2019s a lot worse being done,\u201d she said.\n\nHoward Chipman, the doctor Ambrosia hired in Tampa, also said he hadn\u2019t seen the results. HuffPost could not find a participant who had.\n\nTom Casey, the CEO of NuPlasma, a company that sells young plasma to physicians in Texas \u2015 and is supplying another young plasma study in Houston \u2014 urged Karmazin to release the data. \u201cThe people who are criticizing you are criticizing you because you called this a trial and said you were collecting data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still no data.\u201d\n\nResults Not Guaranteed\n\nKarmazin and David Cavalier, Ambrosia\u2019s then-president and chief operating officer, said earlier this past fall that they had to be careful not to make any guarantees about the effects of Ambrosia\u2019s treatment. Companies generally need to get approval from the FDA before they can claim that a drug or medical product treats, cures or prevents a disease. Cavalier noted that Ambrosia transfused a Parkinson\u2019s patient who reported an improvement in a tremor, a patient with depleted testosterone levels who was soon \u201cenjoying morning erections again,\u201d and people who reported improvements with arthritis symptoms, sleep, memory and energy levels.\n\nSome of Ambrosia\u2019s claims to the media have been \u201cmaybe a little bit exuberant\u201d but still \u201c100 percent accurate,\u201d Karmazin said.\n\nKarmazin told HuffPost in the fall he temporarily paused transfusions to focus on opening a clinic in New York City by early 2019. Ambrosia is required to obtain a permit to transfuse a blood component in New York, but as of mid-December, the company had not applied for one, according to a New York State Department of Health spokesperson.\n\nHe initially claimed he planned to publish the findings of Ambrosia\u2019s study in a peer-reviewed journal after its clinic was open. He announced this week on his website that Ambrosia is scheduling clients again in San Francisco and Tampa. He brought back two doctors he worked with during the study, he told HuffPost. He said this week that he still hadn\u2019t submitted any data for peer review \u2014 a process that can take months. He was \u201ceager to do so,\u201d but didn\u2019t know precisely when he would.\n\nCavalier quietly left the company this week, right before Ambrosia announced it was offering treatments again. He would not comment on the circumstances of his exit, but noted in an email that he was only with the company for \u201ca very brief period.\u201d Karmazin declined to comment further on Cavalier\u2019s departure.\n\nAnd at least one of Ambrosia\u2019s blood bank partners no longer sells young plasma. Shortly after HuffPost reached out to the South Texas blood bank in October, it abruptly halted all sales of young plasma products, according to an employee email chain HuffPost obtained.\n\n\u201cWe have had a few developments internally due to some negative press,\u201d an employee wrote on Oct. 22. Waltman, the STBTC executive, told HuffPost the bank would not supply Ambrosia with plasma for a clinic rollout because doing so would interfere with their ability to fulfill local needs. The HuffPost inquiry had no bearing on that issue, she added.\n\nFor all its press coverage, Ambrosia did not have any investors as of April 2017, Karmazin said; in September 2018, Karmazin told HuffPost that Ambrosia hadn\u2019t yet raised any money. That same month, he advertised on his LinkedIn page that the company was looking for $3 million to open its first clinic. By November, Karmazin said the LinkedIn posts had been removed because the company had garnered a \u201clarge amount of interest,\u201d but Ambrosia would not comment on whether it had any investors.\n\nDespite Karmazin\u2019s insistence that many people are excited about the treatment, over the course of reporting this story, Ambrosia declined to put HuffPost in touch with a single patient. Initially, Karmazin said the patients are protective of their privacy and \u201cafter the hundredth reporter asked to talk, people were just getting a little tired of answering the same questions.\u201d After HuffPost noted that it could find only one trial participant who had spoken to the press, Karmazin said that in the beginning, he had asked about 10 to 15 patients if they wanted to speak to reporters, but they all declined.\n\nIt appears the only participant in Ambrosia\u2019s trial who spoke to the press was a man from Georgia. He told a German newspaper that he was one of Ambrosia\u2019s first patients and had perhaps received \u201cmore blood plasma than anyone else in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia man was \u201cthe most excited person about this treatment,\u201d Karmazin told HuffPost. He died after going into cardiac arrest in February 2018 at the age of 65.\n\nYoung plasma \u201cisn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d the man told New Scientist last year. But he had hoped he could \u201cjust get 10 more healthy years of living.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s family did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the circumstances of his death, and a doctor familiar with his case declined to comment without a family member\u2019s permission. Karmazin said there were no deaths during or after the trial related to the treatment. It is unclear when the man received his final treatment with Ambrosia.\n\nThese days, Karmazin won\u2019t even publicly admit whether he has tried the treatment Ambrosia is hawking. He told one news outlet in June 2017 he hadn\u2019t, claiming he was waiting until he\u2019d be \u201cold enough\u201d at 35. In a separate interview in December 2017, when he was still not yet 35, he said he\u2019d tried it \u201ca few times\u201d and it felt \u201cpretty phenomenal.\u201d Speaking to HuffPost, he refused to comment, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to confirm that I\u2019ve done it for the purposes of this interview,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, spending $8,000 on a young plasma transfusion is a \u201creally good use of people\u2019s health care dollars,\u201d Karmazin said. Those with certain diseases \u201cshould be getting treatment right away,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to be treating as many people as possible.\u201d\n\nThis week, Karmazin announced Ambrosia has lowered its age limit and raised its prices. People as young as 30 are now eligible for treatment. And two liters of young plasma costs $12,000.\n\nGot tips?

The new rule would not factor in the harder-to-quantify benefits linked to preventing those health consequences, such as protecting fetuses whose intelligence could be affected in the long term by the amount of mercury their mothers ingested when they were pregnant with them.\n\n\u201cThe administrator has concluded that the identification of these benefits is not sufficient, in light of the gross imbalance of monetized costs,\u201d the EPA announcement read, bucking the Obama administration\u2019s conclusion that the mercury rule should be evaluated on factors beyond monetary costs.\n\nIf the change is finalized, the mercury rule could be opened up to clearer legal challenges in court, and other clean air regulations may also be put at risk.\n\nThe change would also be a financial windfall for the coal industry. The mercury rule costs the coal industry $9.6 billion a year \u2015 making it one of the most expensive regulations ever issued by the EPA.\n\nBut the proposal reverses a decades-old finding \u2015 reaffirmed twice by the EPA \u2015 that the agency was within its legal grounds to control emissions of power-plant mercury and other dangerous pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses, neurological damage and cancer.\n\n\u201cWhat has changed now is the administration\u2019s attitude towards public health, and towards the coal industry\u201d Ann Weeks, legal director of the nonpartisan Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. \u201cEPA proposes to disregard many of the important public benefits that result from controlling all the toxic air emissions from this industry.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the EPA\u2019s own analysis determined that the rule would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths, 130,000 asthma attacks and 5,700 hospital visits every year, and save taxpayers $90 billion in health care costs annually.\n\n\u201cChildren are especially vulnerable to environmental changes as they are smaller in size, breathe faster than adults, and experience rapid and critical periods of growth and development,\u201d Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the EPA to maintain these critical standards, and call on Congress to protect the MATS rule so that all children, regardless of their ZIP code, can breathe clean air.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Instagram Accidentally Changed How You Scroll And People On Twitter Were Upset", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-scroll-update_us_5c24efb8e4b08aaf7a8e401d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "Instagram appears to have changed how users scroll through the application ... and then it changed it back.

Giuliani, faulted the presumptive incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, for leaving for Hawaii while the government was partly shuttered. They blamed Democrats for not reaching out to forge a compromise.\n\n\u201cThose who have completely walked away from the table are doing no justice to the people of this country,\u201d Ms. Conway said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday morning.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump consider his statement about owning a shutdown regrettable. But White House officials and others close to the president also believe that a shutdown is unlikely to help Ms. Pelosi as she takes over as part of the new House majority, and that Democratic officials risk looking unreasonable.\n\nPelosi allies say that they think the shutdown will help her look like the adult in the room, because she is going to quickly move to end it, demonstrating that Democrats are serious about governing.\n\nMs. Conway did not rule out a presidential veto of the bill the House Democrats plan to advance.\n\n\u201cIt depends what\u2019s in it,\u201d she said.\n\nSenator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the Senate would not take up the House bill unless Mr. Trump backed it.

They were also notable given Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence for most of his term that the border would have a wall, not the \u201csteel slat barrier\u201d he has pivoted toward in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not a wall,\u201d Mr. Kelly told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nMr. Kelly, whose last day in his role is Monday, said he had sought advice from Customs and Border Protection officials early in 2017, when he was the homeland security secretary.

Through a haze of tear gas and black smoke, she tries to reach a man sprawled on the ground along the Gaza border. Israeli soldiers, their weapons leveled, watch warily from the other side.\n\nMinutes later, a rifle shot rips through the din, and the Israeli-Palestinian drama has its newest tragic figure.\n\nFor a few days in June, the world took notice of the death of 20-year-old Rouzan al-Najjar, killed while treating the wounded at protests against Israel\u2019s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Even as she was buried, she became a symbol of the conflict, with both sides staking out competing and mutually exclusive narratives.\n\nTo the Palestinians, she was an innocent martyr killed in cold blood, an example of Israel\u2019s disregard for Palestinian life. To the Israelis, she was part of a violent protest aimed at destroying their country, to which lethal force is a legitimate response as a last resort.\n\nPalestinian witnesses embellished their initial accounts, saying she was shot while raising her hands in the air. The Israeli military tweeted a tendentiously edited video that made it sound like she was offering herself as a human shield for terrorists.\n\nIn each version, Ms. Najjar was little more than a cardboard cutout.\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times found that Ms. Najjar, and what happened on the evening of June 1, were far more complicated than either narrative allowed. Charismatic and committed, she defied the expectations of both sides. Her death was a poignant illustration of the cost of Israel\u2019s use of battlefield weapons to control the protests, a policy that has taken the lives of nearly 200 Palestinians.\n\nIt also shows how each side is locked into a seemingly unending and insolvable cycle of violence. The Palestinians trying to tear down the fence are risking their lives to make a point, knowing that the protests amount to little more than a public relations stunt for Hamas, the militant movement that rules Gaza. And Israel, the far stronger party, continues to focus on containment rather than finding a solution.\n\nIn life, Ms. Najjar was a natural leader whose uncommon bravery struck some peers as foolhardy. She was a capable young medic, but one who was largely self-taught and lied about her lack of education. She was a feminist, by Gaza standards, shattering traditional gender rules, but also a daughter who doted on her father, was particular about her appearance and was slowly assembling a trousseau. She inspired others with her outward jauntiness, while privately she was consumed with dread in her final days.\n\nThe bullet that killed her, The Times found, was fired by an Israeli sniper into a crowd that included white-coated medics in plain view. A detailed reconstruction, stitched together from hundreds of crowd-sourced videos and photographs, shows that neither the medics nor anyone around them posed any apparent threat of violence to Israeli personnel. Though Israel later admitted her killing was unintentional, the shooting appears to have been reckless at best, and possibly a war crime, for which no one has yet been punished."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "title": "China Thwarts U.S. Effort to Promote American Culture on Campuses", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/world/asia/china-american-centers-culture.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-31 09:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "BEIJING \u2014 The American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, wanted to make what in most nations would have been a routine trip.\n\nOne of his favorite schools, Iowa State University, had opened a center to promote American culture in an inland Chinese province, and the laid-back former governor of Iowa was eager to take questions from Chinese students.\n\nThe center\u2019s program, largely financed by the State Department, was deliberately benign so as not to offend Chinese government sensibilities.
