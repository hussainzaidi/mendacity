Presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has zero desire to acquiesce to the President during her first hours with a gavel in hand. Her diverse caucus may yet disagree on much, but they appear in lockstep over opposing Trump on the wall.\n\nSenate Republicans, who already voted once in the last Congress to keep government open, are on the sidelines having made clear they won't act on anything until a deal is reached that Trump will actually sign. And holiday season distractions meant that the misery of federal workers deprived of paychecks did not reach a critical mass that would force lawmakers to demand a swift resolution.\n\nSo, barring a miracle, the partial shutdown is not ending any time soon.\n\nSenate Republican Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday it could take \"weeks\" for government to reopen. Trump told reporters a resolution could take \"a long time.\"\n\nThe President hardened his position in an extraordinary 95-minute exchange that rambled through topics as diverse as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and machine gun-wielding Secret Service officers.\n\nStill mourning his canceled vacation in balmy Palm Beach, the President said he had hoped that Democrats would come back to town during his home alone Christmas to negotiate\n\nAnd he dug in on the $5 billion figure -- even after Vice President Mike Pence offered Democrats a $2.5 billion funding combination for border security and immigration funding late last year.\n\n\"No, not $2.5 billion, no. We're asking for $5.6 billion. And you know, if somebody said $2.5 billion, no,\" Trump said.\n\nThe political logic that prompted Trump to allow the government to close -- heavy pressure from conservative pundits and House lawmakers -- has not yet changed.\n\nHe's in no position to blink.\n\nIf he caves now, he will get the backlash he feared before, with extra intensity.\n\nDuring a Situation Room meeting involving congressional leaders, Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, asked Trump three times why he could not accept a short-term extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security while further negotiations take place.\n\n\"I would look foolish if I did that,\" Trump told Schumer, a person familiar with the conversation told CNN's Phil Mattingly.\n\nJudging by a barrage of holiday season tweets, Trump thinks he can wound the new Democratic majority in the House -- both by overshadowing its big opening day and branding his rivals weak on immigration.\n\nApparently seeking to build pressure on Democrats, two senior administration officials told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told the leaders: \"This is not a status quo situation. We are in a crisis situation.\"\n\nDemocrats ready to wield power\n\nJUST WATCHED Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer: GOP using shutdown as hostage 02:19\n\nYet Democrats don't seem spooked by Trump's gambit.\n\nIn fact, the President's hardline rhetoric on immigration was blamed by many analysts on both sides of the political divide for the disastrous performance among suburban voters that cost the GOP its House majority.\n\nStill, the wall was fundamental to Trump's appeal to his base, and helped win him the Republican nomination, so it's hardly surprising his calculations on the issue differ from those of outsiders.\n\nTrump, who ran against the Washington establishment and believes there is a deep state conspiracy to thwart him, may also be impervious to the plight of federal workers\n\n\"The President is not long on empathy,\" said Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania who often supports Trump and is now a CNN political analyst.\n\n\"I think he feels like he can weather this storm because he's not really concerned about the people calling him and saying 'I can't pay my bills' ... I think he feels like this is the issue he wants to set the template for how this Congress is going to work with the Democrats in charge,\" Santorum said.\n\nOnce Pelosi is sworn in for her second spell as House speaker, a step expected later Thursday, she plans to show that Democrats can offer stable, responsible government in contrast to the chaos of the Trump era.\n\nThat's why one of the first acts of the new Democratic House will be to pass a bill that would reopen the government in the short term and does not fund the wall -- essentially replicating a bill passed in the GOP-led Senate last year.\n\n\"We're asking the President to open up government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it? Why would he not do it?\" Pelosi said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe strategy lets Democrats make the case that they had power for a matter of hours and tried to reopen government.\n\nDepriving Trump of funding for his wall -- the ultimate symbol of the Democratic Party's 2016 election humiliation -- also fosters unity in a coalition already showing ethnic, gender and generational fault lines.\n\nAs an added benefit, Democrats can also drive a wedge between the rival GOP centers of power in Washington and expose the tenuous relationship between Senate Republicans and their President.\n\nWednesday's events also suggest that Trump, who has spent his entire presidency cocooned by a GOP power monopoly in Washington, is yet to appreciate the new reality of divided government. He will no longer be able to activate a cell of conservatives Republicans to incite chaos in the House.\n\nHow the shutdown could end\n\nMcConnell is signaling that the House vote on reopening the government will not change much.\n\n\"One partisan vote in the House tomorrow is not going to solve anything. I made it clear to the Speaker we're not interested in show votes in the Senate,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nSo far, there is no sign that Senate Republicans are maneuvering to offer Trump a face saving way out of what appears to be a dead end. In the past McConnell has been key to ending standoffs between various administrations and Capitol Hill.\n\nEventually, however, the shutdown may get resolved in the typical Washington way, with a fudge that offers both sides a way to claim victory.\n\nIt will come as no consolation to government workers who have been furloughed or who are working without pay that their plight has not yet dominated news coverage, as during is often the case in shutdowns.\n\nSoon the real victims of the shutdown will begin inundating the offices of their Washington representatives with calls -- adding to political pressure for an end to the shutdown.\n\nIt's not as if there are no ideas for how to fix the situation that do not involve an abject climbdown by either side.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee published an op-ed in The Washington Post offering three approaches , including some already agreed in the past by bipartisan majorities.\n\nYet Trump's stream of consciousness in his press availability at the White House Wednesday was a reminder that he is a wild card, as impenetrable to his own side as to Democrats. He made up facts and offered no tell about what kind of fall back position he would accept.\n\nThat means that even if legislative linguists on Capitol Hill craft a way out for everyone, there is no guarantee that an unpredictable President, answering only to his gut, will buy it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Why singer Tony Bennett is at the Capitol today", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Drbu9Hjx7lM/h_0a51f80c22a089b54fadbc89ba0c4d86", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Any moment now we expect to start seeing the roll call for the speaker vote.

China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\n\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen arrives for a press conference at the Presidential Palace after the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on January 1, 2019.\n\nCross-strait tensions\n\nXi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address , in which she called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n\nWhile she acknowledged the elections were a \"serious test for the current government,\" Tsai said the results \"absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\"\n\nShe also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's \"attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Xi said China had \"achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\"\n\nLev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\n\n\"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections,\" he said. \"This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\"\n\nNachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing \"now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\"\n\n\"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force,\" he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\n\nA group of Hong Kong independence supporters display flags during the annual New Year's Day pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong on January 1, 2019.\n\nHong Kong model\n\nThroughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to \"One Country, Two Systems\" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\n\nThat is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\n\n\"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security,\" Xi said.\n\nHow attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election . Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\n\n\"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely,\" Nachman said.\n\n\"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\"\n\nSpeaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.\n\n'No promise to renounce force'\n\nWhile Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for \"peaceful reunification\" above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.\n\n\"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" he said.\n\n\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,\" he said, adding that the \"issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\"\n\nWhile it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "6 killed in train accident on Danish bridge", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/MIe-k6LYwoc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) Six people were killed and 16 injured when a crowded commuter train and a truck trailer that apparently fell from a freight train collided on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, authorities said.\n\nThe rail accident, which is one of the deadliest in Danish history, took place at about 7:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. ET) Wednesday in high winds on a bridge linking the islands of Zealand and Funen.\n\nBo Haaning, of the Danish Accident Investigation Board, confirmed to CNN that the trailer had fallen off the freight train and hit the passenger train, but said it was not yet known whether this caused the accident or happened during it.\n\nThe freight train was carrying Carlsberg beer, a spokesman for the brewing company, which has its headquarters in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, told CNN.

Her mom got her a tutor, she took online classes and she got a copy of a The Princeton Review prep book.\n\nSeven months later, in October, the high school senior from Miami Gardens, Florida, took the test again.\n\nLater, when she got an envelope in the mail from the testing company, she was shocked when she opened it.\n\nIt was a letter. Not results.\n\n\"We are writing to you because based on a preliminary review, there appears to be substantial evidence that your scores ... are invalid,\" it said. \"Our preliminary concerns are based on substantial agreement between your answers on one or more scored sections of the test and those of other test takers.

I studied, and I focused to achieve my dream,\" she told reporters Wednesday. \"I worked so hard and did everything I could do.\"\n\nA score is never flagged for review solely on score gains, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman for The College Board, the company that conducts the SAT. Indeed, score gains are celebrated.\n\nBut scores may be flagged for a number of reasons, including testing sheets having similar answers or an incident occurring at the testing site, he said. Goldberg could not say how many tests have been flagged.\n\nAs for Campbell's case, \"the letter never references score gains as a reason for her scores being under review,\" Goldberg added by email, noting he'd only discuss details the student already has made public.\n\n'Trying to assassinate her character'\n\nProminent civil rights attorney Ben Crump, a Florida State graduate, got involved when other FSU alums asked him to help.

Reviews typically take four to six weeks, Goldberg said.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump says a test company is unfairly refusing to validate the SAT score of Kamilah Campbell because she improved her score by too many points.\n\nCrump reiterated that they believe the score is not being validated because Campbell improved 330 points.\n\n\"Instead of celebrating her and celebrating her achievement, they are trying to assassinate her character, and we won't stand for that,\" he said.\n\nThe superintendent of the Miami-Dade school district also has asked The College Board for assurances the investigation will be quick, the district's chief spokeswoman said, calling the situation \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"Although this is a test administered by a private entity, and not M-DCPS, we feel a moral obligation to intervene,\" Daisy Gonzalez-Diego said.\n\nCampbell and Crump now are involved in The College Board's \"consistent, established procedure to assess the validity of scores,\" Goldberg said by email. It includes \"the opportunity to provide relevant information, which is used to help make determinations about the validity of the test scores following a complete investigation.\"\n\n\"At the end of the score validity process, we will only cancel scores if we are confident that there is substantial evidence to do so,\" Goldberg continued, without offering a time frame. \"We never cancel scores on score gains alone.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A man attacked a McDonald's employee over a straw and she fought back", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/90132Qwx4qc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A new plastic straw law had unexpected consequences when a man lashed out at a worker at a fast food chain.\n\nThe Florida man had just received his order at a McDonald's in St. Petersburg on Monday evening.

It was early in the evening on New Year's Eve and her daughter was in the drivethrough picking up an order.\n\nAs seen in the video, Taylor leaned over the counter and quickly grabbed Yasmine James, who was working the register, by the shirt collar. He pulled her close to his face.\n\nSeconds later, James started whaling on the man, punch after punch. They gripped onto each other as the woman defended herself. Fists flew and so did expletives.\n\nPeople could be heard saying \"stop\" and \"let her go\" in the background. It took employees almost 15 seconds to separate them.\n\nAfter being pulled from Taylor's grip, James yelled and cursed at the man as she was led away by a colleague.

Tateona Bell, the employee who was kicked, complained of pain afterward.\n\nBy that time, Biandudi had gotten her order and gone outside to her daughter. She said she watched as another employee was finally able to escort the man outside.\n\n\"I knocked on the door and pointed to my phone and said I have a video and they let me in. They had locked the door when they got the man out of the store,\" Biandudi said.\n\nWhen police arrived, she talked to officers and gave them the video of the incident.\n\nOfficers recognized the man when he called police later\n\nSoon after the incident, Taylor called the police from a couple miles down the road to complain that he'd been hit repeatedly in the head, police spokeswoman Sandra Bentil told CNN.\n\n\"When the officers arrived, they recognized Taylor from the video at McDonald's and took him into custody,\" police said in a statement.\n\nBentil said the motive behind the attack is still under investigation.\n\nMcDonald's is aware of the incident and cooperating with police.\n\n\"Our highest priority is always the safety and well-being of our employees and customers at our restaurants.

Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either.

There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.\n\nThose days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.\n\nTrump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth.

So, there's that.\n\n4. \"When they say I'm not popular in Europe, I shouldn't be popular in Europe.\"\n\nOne of the least covered but most important aspects of the Trump presidency is how he, unlike every president that has come before him, simply does not believe in the coalition built in the aftermath of Word War II.\n\n5. \"I don't care about Europe.\"\n\nSee No. 4.\n\n6. \"I know every angle.\"\n\n[nods]\n\n7. \"I could be the most popular person in Europe. I could be -- I could run for any office if I wanted to, but I don't want to.\"\n\nSo. Wait. Trump is saying he could run for any office in Europe? I am pretty sure that's not true....\n\n8. \"I mean, I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, but he's constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan, OK?\"\n\nIndia was, um, not pleased with this taunt.\n\n9. \"We're supposed to say 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan, but one of those things.\"\n\nSo, Trump believes a library in Afghanistan is pointless because it's in Afghanistan and, therefore, people won't use it? Got it!\n\n10. \"And you know, look, I endorsed (Mitt Romney), he thanked me very profusely, he was very nice.\"\n\nThis is a good dig by Trump -- highlighting the fact that Romney is speaking out against him only now that the political risks for doing so are tiny.\n\n11. \"We've got the greatest tax cuts ever\"\n\nIt's sort of hard to quantify \"greatest\" but Trump has repeatedly said that his tax cut was the largest in history. It was not\n\n12. \"The deductible is so high, unless you get hit by a tractor you can't even use them, nobody's ever seen anything like it.\"\n\nDo a lot of people get hit by tractors?\n\n13. \"I have great popularity in Utah\"\n\n14. \"President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I. I want results.\"\n\nTrump is talking about former Defense Secretary James Mattis. He's not talking about him accurately, however. Mattis resigned in protest in the wake of Trump's decision to pull US troops out Syria. Trump didn't \"essentially\" fire him. At all.\n\n15. \"Russia used to be the Soviet Union, Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan -- Russia.\"\n\nLooks, I've seen \"Spies Like Us .\" I know about Russia. And the Soviet Union. And all that.\n\n16. \"The problem is it was a tough fight and, literally, they went bankrupt, they went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, lot of -- a lot of these places you're reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan.\"\n\n17. \"I think I would've been a good general, but who knows.\"\n\nWe will never know. Mostly because Trump is not now and never was in the military. Including during the Vietnam War when he got five deferments -- including one for bone spurs.\n\n18. \"We're talking about sand and death. That's what we're talking about.\"\n\nThe President of the United States offers his thoughts on Syria.\n\n19. \"Now, the Kurds, it's very interesting, Turkey doesn't like them; other people do.\"\n\nThe Kurds: Some people say they are great, some say they aren't. We may never know!\n\n20. \"I had a meeting at the Pentagon with lots of generals -- they were like from a movie, better looking than Tom Cruise and stronger -- and I had more generals than I've ever seen.\"\n\nThis is so revealing. All of life is a casting call for Trump. These generals were good because they were good looking and strong. Even more than Tom Cruise!\n\n21. \"I said, this is the greatest room I've ever seen. I -- I saw more computer boards than, I think, that they make today.\"\n\n\"Computer boards.\"\n\n22. \"Iran is pulling people out of Syria -- they can do what they want there, frankly -- but they're pulling people out.\"\n\nThis is an interesting take on the Middle East. And one that Israel likely will be interested in hearing more about.\n\n23. \"We're getting out, and we're getting out smart, and we're winning. We're winning, OK?\"\n\nUm, OK?\n\n24. \"I never saw anything so beautiful in my life.\"\n\nThe birth of his child? His bride on their wedding day? Nope! He's talking about the House vote for $5 billion in wall funding in late December.\n\n25. \"Can you imagine me having that power? Wouldn't that be scary? Right?\"\n\nTrump is referring here to then-President Barack Obama's decision to create the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, essentially allowing children brought into the country illegally to remain without fear of deportation. But man oh man, that quote out of context is really something.\n\n26. \"Could be a long time and it could be quickly. Could be a long time.\"\n\nWhat an answer to the question of how long the government might be shut down! Could be a while. Might not be. But could be!\n\n27. \"It's a big, big house. Except for all the guys out on the lawn with machine guns. Nicest machine guns I've ever seen.\"\n\nEven when talking about the Secret Service that protect the White House, Trump has to exaggerate. These weren't just machine guns. They were the \"nicest machine guns ever.\"\n\n28. \"I was waving to them. I -- I never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life.\"\n\nMany people are saying it was the most -- and most beautiful -- machine guns ever used in one place.\n\n29. \"Secret Service and military, these are great people and they don't play games. They don't, like, wave. They don't even smile.\"\n\nSecret Service: not big wavers. Also, anti-smiling.\n\n30. \"Look, look, when they say the wall's immoral well then you -- you've got to do something about the Vatican because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all.\"\n\nBizarrely, this is not the first time Trump or a top aide has attacked the Vatican for its wall. Back in 2016, Trump aide Dan Scavino tweeted that the Pope was a hypocrite on immigration because Vatican City was surrounded by massive walls. As CNN's Daniel Burke wrote at the time : \"Yes, the Vatican does have walls, and some are quite large. But anyone can stroll through the Pope's front yard -- St. Peter's Square -- at nearly any time.\"\n\n31. \"Look at all of the countries that have walls and they work 100%.\"\n\nOK, so, according to Trump, any country with a wall around its border is totally and completely impenetrable to outsiders.\n\nAs in, no one has ever breached the wall. It can't be breached. Unless, say, one side had an ice dragon. ...\n\n32. \"I could have had a lot easier presidency by doing nothing.\"\n\nAhem.\n\n33. \"People see that gasoline is way down. And the reason its way down is because I called up some of the OPEC people.\"\n\n34. \"I mean, I just got rid of -- I -- I wouldn't say got -- they say they're retired.\"\n\nAn amazing and overlooked moment. Asked what would happen if Romney didn't get on board with him, Trump cited the retirements of GOP Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake -- threatening that Romney would find himself in the same position if he kept crossing Trump. Little mob boss-y, no?\n\n35. \"So Jeff Flake is now selling real estate, or whatever he's doing.\"\n\nI am not sure where Trump got the idea Flake is going to be selling real estate as his post-Senate career. To the best of my searching, Flake hasn't announced what he's going to do after leaving the Senate. Also, isn't \"sell real estate\" what Trump did his whole professional life prior to 2016?\n\n36. \"I will tell you, we have some great Republicans, and if you look at the way they're standing up for border security, you'd be very proud of them if you're a Republican, or if you're a person that loves our nation.\"\n\nSo, \"loves our nation\" = supports shutting down the government to secure $5 billion to build a border wall. This feels like a good place to end."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "The secret to a long, happy, healthy life?

But now there is scientific evidence that respect can potentially save lives among the elderly and keep them both physically and mentally healthy.\n\nAn analysis by the global journalism network Orb Media found that countries with high levels of respect for the elderly recorded better health among older populations and lower poverty levels for over-60s.\n\nAs we enter a new phase of history -- with 2.1 billion people predicted to live beyond 60 by 2050 -- global attitudes toward older people have not kept up.\n\nIn a 2016 World Health Organization survey across 57 countries, 60% of respondents reported that older people are not respected.\n\nA more recent report by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK gauged the feelings of 2,000 British citizens and found some other bleak trends. Almost half -- 47% -- believed that people over 65 struggled to learn new skills. A quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds and 15% of the total respondents agreed that \"it is normal to be unhappy and depressed when you are old.\"\n\nBecca Levy, professor of public health and psychology at Yale School of Public Health, believes that negative attitudes are due to \"the growing medicalization of older adults\" and \"the growing anti-aging industry that promotes and actually profits from a fear of aging.\"\n\nBut in the UK alone, older people made net contributions to the economy of nearly 40 billion pounds (US $52.64 billion) during 2011, according to a 2011 analysis.\n\nThe dangers of stereotypes\n\nNegative stereotypes can be dangerous to older people in a number of ways, including shortening their lives.\n\nLevy analyzed interviews with 660 people from Oxford, Ohio, that were conducted over more than two decades and matched these with mortality information. Her team found that those with a positive attitude toward aging lived on average 7.5 years longer than those who viewed it as something bad.\n\n\"We were very surprised at this difference,\" said Levy, who believes that people with positive mindsets were able to live longer because positive attitudes can influence psychological, behavioral and physiological mechanisms in the body.\n\nPositive thinking can better behavior by leading people to engage in healthier lifestyles such as exercise. A person's positivity can also improve their psychology, making them better at coping with stress -- a contributor to memory loss and brain shrinkage\n\nAccording to one of Levy's studies , in Ireland over the span of 30 years, mental conditions such as depression and anxiety were more common among people with negative ideas about aging.\n\nDr. Luigi Ferrucci, geriatrician and director of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging , was skeptical at first when the idea of a link between someone's health and their feelings about age was suggested.\n\nThe Baltimore team's study, which started in 1958, also asked participants about their thoughts on aging, and expecting to find no connection between the two. But they soon discovered that people with a positive attitude toward aging had less cardiovascular disease, they produced less cortisol -- a stress hormone -- over time, and autopsy findings showed less frequent dementia.\n\n\"Using very, very objective measures, we found that they were much better compared to those that had a negative attitude,\" Ferrucci said.\n\nBut he cautioned that, \"while the evidence is really strong, whether we can we generalize this [finding] to the general population is not completely understood.\"\n\nWhere are people most negative?\n\n\"High income countries are the highly industrialized countries and industrialization tends to devalue older people,\" explained Erdman Palmore, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, in an email, adding that traditional rural societies tend to have higher respect because older people can keep working longer and are more valuable to the economy.\n\nRetirement policies make older people seem less valuable to society and a country's economy, he said.\n\nJapan, South Korea and Argentina are the three lowest-ranking countries when it comes to respect for the elderly, according to World Values Survey carried out between 2010 and 2014, despite their large elderly populations. These respect estimates -- recorded in 2014 -- paint a changing picture of perceptions.\n\nIn Japan , for example, middle-age men, who were traditionally valued, are now seen as having lost their honor and value in society.\n\nThe UK report found that most beliefs around age are formed by the age of 6. \"Once prejudice has been learned it is often very hard to unlearn,\" the report's lead author, Toby Green, wrote in an email.\n\n\"For many people the stereotypes they absorb then persist into later life -- at which point they begin to apply them to themselves. This means that negative age stereotypes are embedded among groups of all ages,\" he said.\n\nElderly people walk in the street at Kouganji Temple in Tokyo.\n\nWhere did the stereotypes come from?\n\nRewinding the clock 200 years, researchers found a shift in attitudes toward the elderly in 1880.\n\nIn one study , they analyzed synonyms for the word 'elderly' in a database of 400 million words included in a range or print sources from the past two centuries and found that from 1810 to 1879, the concept of getting older was viewed positively in the United States.\n\nThen, from 1880 onward -- the midst of industrialization -- people started seeing aging as something bad. The researchers suggest the rising number of people over the age of 65 was associated with the increase in negative beliefs around age.\n\nStill, there remain many countries where the elderly are viewed as a valuable part of the population and deserving of respect.\n\nGeorgia, Uzbekistan and Qatar scored top places in the world value survey when asked about whether people aged over 70 are likely to be seen with respect.\n\nPositive mindsets about age have very real impacts on the elderly.\n\n2018 study found that the chances of dementia can be lowered by 49.8% if a positive outlook is maintained. Older people with happy thoughts have also been proven to recover faster from cardiovascular events, according to Levy's work.\n\nThe need for integration\n\nIn 2016, WHO acknowledged the need for ageism to be globally addressed and highlighted that ageism is most likely more widespread than sexism and racism.\n\nGreen believes that one of the solutions to reducing ageism is integrating generations.\n\nHis report for the Royal Society of Public health found that 64% of Brits didn't have a friend who is at least 30 years older than they are.\n\nIntegration is \"really important -- there's so much evidence on the health and wellbeing benefits of this,\" he said.\n\nStarting with young children and encouraging workplace diversity to tackle ageism are other strategies Green recommends. \"Making this progress in workplace settings would do a great deal of good for wider cultural change.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFerrucci believes that \"we need to see our life as a trajectory.

It's a strip that allows people who use street drugs such as cocaine and heroin to test whether their drugs are laced with fentanyl.\n\nIf the drugs test positive, they might choose not to use them or choose to use less of them.\n\nAccording to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , fentanyl is now the deadliest drug in America and was linked to nearly 29% of all overdose deaths in 2016. The synthetic opioid is about 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine and produces a powerful high. It's cheap and sometimes mixed into street drugs without the buyer even knowing. Given its potency, it can be deadly.\n\nFentanyl test strip technology was originally developed by a Canadian biotech company BTNX to test urine samples for the presence of the drug, but the strips work basically the same way when they're dipped in the residue of cooked heroin or when a little water is added to empty baggies of cocaine.\n\nIt works like a pregnancy test in reverse. One line on the strip suggests that the drugs are positive for fentanyl. Two lines is interpreted as a negative result.\n\nIn a study , researchers at Johns Hopkins and Brown University determined that the test strips worked to detect even low concentrations of fentanyl in street drugs.\n\n\"Our findings bring to the table evidence that can inform a public health approach to the fentanyl crisis. Smart strategies that reduce harm can save lives,\" Susan Sherman, a co-author on the study, said in a news release\n\nAccording to the study, several programs in the United States that distribute clean syringes to people who use drugs have started to distribute fentanyl test strips, as well.\n\nIn Los Angeles County , emergency departments, first responders and other heath care workers have been advised to discuss the potential risks and benefits of the strips with patients who use street drugs.\n\nThe test strips aren't 100% effective at eliminating the risk of overdose, since they don't identify all forms of fentanyl and can produce false negatives. They also don't let users know how much fentanyl the drugs contain.\n\nStill, the researchers see an opportunity to halt the increase in fentanyl-related overdose deaths.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in the overdose epidemic, and we need to embrace the full range of interventions that can save lives,\" Sherman said.\n\nIn a video , the Urban Survivor's Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of drug users, offers instructions on how to use the strips and what to do if the results are positive.\n\n\"Let's say you had some drugs you were going to inject. ... If it tests positive, you have options,\" the video explains. \"One, you can shoot half back into another sterile syringe, which may not only be life-saving but also cost-effective. Or two, you may even choose not to do it.\"\n\nThe concept of drug checking has jarred some.\n\nThe Trump administration's assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for mental Health and substance use, Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, has expressed ardent opposition to the use of the fentanyl test strips.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a blog post , Katz laid out several reasons. Among them is a concern that even if people who use drugs know that their drugs are laced with fentanyl, they will still use the drugs, despite the apparent danger. They might also use the strips to seek out drugs that contain fentanyl to achieve a stronger high.\n\n\"We can't afford to create a false sense of security. ...

MUST WATCH A 360\u00b0 look inside the operating room during the boys' surgery 06:16\n\nPost-surgery, Anias has struggled more with breathing and an array of other issues. He used a breathing machine to keep him alive and other equipment was hooked up to him to monitor his vitals.\n\nAnias faced major setbacks over the past year. He stopped rolling. He stopped playing with toys. He stopped lifting his head because so much fluid had built around his brain it weighed him down.\n\n\"It was horrific for me to watch,\" Nicole says. Anias had not \"just stopped development, but regressed in development.\"\n\nHe also developed eczema so bad, his mother says, his legs and ankles were like \"raw meat.\" He started having seizures so severe that he'd turn blue up to 15 times a day.\n\n\"I thought I was losing him forever, and I was devastated,\" Nicole said.\n\nBut he recently had his tonsils and adenoids removed, allowing him to breathe on his own and freeing him from the array of medical equipment that was hooked up to him. Since then, the parents have seen a vast improvement. He's begun lifting his head and using his hands and feet in ways he couldn't before -- a spark of hope after a year of heartache.\n\nOn the fridge, the family displays a hand-splattered painting by Anias, titled by his parents. \"Painted this with the right hand that I'm not supposed to be able to use,\" it says.\n\n\"Anias had like Mount Everest medically,\" Nicole said. \"That's what I've started to appreciate is, he climbed his medical mountain.\"\n\nChristian said, \"He's making progress. It's just slow. But it's there, every day.\"\n\n'You just want him to fly'\n\nWhen CNN last visited, the boys were closer in their progress, considering that the surgery had set them back to infancy in many ways. They had to learn how to sit up, crawl and do the other things every baby learns. Anias was a few months behind Jadon developmentally, but it seemed he was on track to catch up. He was able to roll and clap his hands.\n\nAnias lost most of his function over the last year, but his parents say they've begun to see major progress in the past few weeks.\n\n\"What was hard was to see that he was on the same path as Jadon, and then something happened -- lots of things happened -- to pull him out of that race for a minute,\" Nicole said. \"I feel like I'm constantly fighting for the Anias I know.\"\n\nAs a mom, she says, \"you just want him to fly, and he's still stuck on the ground. That was really difficult, but we just had this ray of hope, like in the last month.\n\n\"That's lifts us both,\" she said, \"and we're ready to help him take off.\n\n\"He's the most medically stable he's ever been. He's getting stronger every day,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a huge change in him over this next year.\"\n\nShe's determined to see Anias become the boy she believes he can be. She tells him things like \"someday, you're going to sit up. Someday, you're going to walk to me.\" He often smiles at her encouraging words.\n\nBoth parents say they are focused in the moment, simply trying to enjoy their boys and relishing their growth.\n\nNicole says she will never stop advocating and fighting for her boys.\n\n\"The boys, they may not be perfectly normal little boys like you and me,\" Christian said. \"But that doesn't mean they can't have a great life.\"\n\nHe says he and his wife used to worry about things like whether the boys' hair would grow back enough to cover the scars on their heads from the various surgeries. But now, they now intentionally cut their hair short: \"They earned those scars. You know, they can be proud of them.\"\n\nAt the family table, Nicole recounts a story of Jadon spilling a drink at lunch and how he put her at ease, saying, \"Mommy, it's just an accident.\" She says he then looked at her and said, \"I am smart.\" She laughed and told him, \"You are smart.\" Nicole was still laughing when Jadon added, \"I am funny.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs she tells this story, Jadon looks at her attentively.

Her son David explains why he's backing the appeal and hopes to see his mother freed.\n\nSally's last words to David were supposed to be heartfelt but undramatic. \"You know I love you, don't you?\" she said, fixing his gaze through an open car door, as she dropped him off at work.\n\nA day earlier, she had killed her long-time husband, and father of David, in a frenzied hammer attack. But as he headed to his job, David knew nothing of Richard Challen's gruesome death.\n\nAfter that drop-off, she had planned to swiftly end her own life - jumping from the top floor of a nearby car park. When she realised the car park was closed, she pressed on regardless, driving to Beachy Head in East Sussex. There she planned to jump to her death off the chalky precipice.\n\nFrom the clifftop, Sally called her cousin to admit the killing. She repeated the admission to a suicide team and a chaplain, who had been called to help her.\n\nIt took them two hours to talk her down from the edge.\n\nShe was charged with her husband's murder, convicted and jailed for life.\n\nHowever, eight years on, lawyers acting for Sally Challen are hoping to make legal history, and David is working to help them. They hope to use a law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse, to secure her release.\n\nImage caption David Challen says his mother suffered years of abuse at the hands of his father\n\nJust as physical violence in a relationship has been recognised as a mitigating factor in a killing, her lawyers say her history of psychological abuse by Richard provides a defence of provocation.\n\nThe circumstances around the killing itself give a taste of the sort of coercive control Richard exerted over his wife.\n\nIn the wealthy suburban village of Claygate, Surrey, one wet Saturday morning in August 2010, Sally visited the house she had, until recently, shared with Richard, her husband of 31 years.\n\nHe lived there alone since she had walked out on the relationship the previous November, after discovering he had been visiting prostitutes.\n\nDavid and his elder brother James, who prefers to avoid media attention, say their father inflicted years of psychological abuse on their mother. Having left Richard, the sons were adamant their mother should stay away from him.\n\nHowever, unknown to them, she had secretly begun seeing Richard again, hoping to patch up their marriage.\n\nWhat actually happened in the family home that morning was far removed from reconciliation.\n\nImage copyright Family handout Image caption Richard Challen was, outwardly, a loving family man\n\nOn this particular morning, she drove the short distance from her new home. In the car with her was a handbag and, stashed inside it, with her make-up and money, a hammer.\n\nRichard had wanted her to approve a post-nuptial agreement that would cut her rights to the \u00a31m family home and impose stringent conditions, such as not interrupting him and not talking to other people when they were together in restaurants.\n\nThere was no food in the house and Richard was hungry, so he asked her to go out and buy something for his lunch.\n\nAs she headed back from the shops, Sally suspected Richard had had an ulterior motive for getting her out of the house. So, on her return she picked up his phone, rang the last number he had dialled and found it answered by a woman.\n\nIn the family kitchen, Sally fried bacon and eggs on the hob. Richard sat with his back to her at the table.\n\nCounting Viagra pills\n\nShe served him, and, as he ate, she pulled the hammer from her bag and hit Richard 20 times over the head.\n\nShe then wrapped his body in curtains and blankets, left a note saying: \"I love you, Sally,\" and left.\n\nShe bought herself some cigarettes, drank some wine and composed a suicide note. But she decided to delay killing herself until she had seen David who, at 23, still lived with her.\n\nThe next day, David remembers, his mother dropped him at work and, as he stepped out of the car, she made her heartfelt pledge of love.\n\nLater that day, David was summoned by his manager.\n\n\"Then came round the corner, my cousin, followed by a police officer, uniformed, and rushed to me, grabbed me on both shoulders and said, 'your father's dead'.\"\n\nCharged with her husband's murder, 10 months later Sally stood in the dock of Guildford Crown Court. Her hair was a mess and her fingers stained yellow from smoking. David remembers the proceedings being hard to watch.\n\n\"Anyone standing up who had anything worth saying was not saying enough, or not feeling as if they had enough time, or not being asked the right questions. She was being painted as vengeful and jealous.\"\n\nHere was a woman who counted her husband's Viagra and monitored his phone calls, the prosecution said.\n\nIn court, Sally hardly spoke. But there was video evidence in which she admitted to the killing and testimony from the Beachy Head suicide prevention team. They recounted her confessing: \"I killed him with a hammer. I hit him lots of times... If I can't have him, no-one can.\"\n\nConvicted of murder and jailed for life, all hope appeared to have expired for Sally. Then, in 2015, a law came into force that recognised psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse.\n\nImage copyright Family handout\n\nIn March, Sally Challen won leave to appeal against her conviction. Her lawyers argued her history of psychological abuse at the hands of Richard provided a defence of provocation.\n\nHer solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, thinks the new law should be accepted as \"new evidence\" in the case.\n\nShe believes this is the first time coercive control has been used as a defence in a murder appeal.\n\nIdeally, Ms Wistrich wants the conviction reduced to manslaughter. But she anticipates facing an argument that evidence of Richard's controlling behaviour had been available at the original trial.\n\nThe fact that the family want to see her freed and none of Richard's friends or relatives has come forward to say otherwise, is significant, she believes. But she fears the fact Sally brought the hammer with her \"with a conditional intent to use it\", suggests some premeditation. This could mean the murder conviction will stand, says Ms Wistrich.\n\nBoth grown-up sons back the legal challenge, with David clear that his father's treatment of his mother is a textbook example of coercive control.\n\n\"It was tick, tick, tick - everything: financial abuse, psychological manipulation, controlling her freedom of movement, just controlling every facet of her mind... It was almost like she was a robot and he punched in the commands of what she had to do.\"\n\nImage copyright Family handout Image caption Sally and Richard on their wedding day in 1979\n\nRichard's psychological hold over Sally began early, David believes.\n\nSally Jenney was 15 when she met Richard, five years her senior, in 1971. They were married in 1979. Sally had nothing but wide-eyed love for Richard, David says, but his father felt otherwise.\n\n\"Seeing women, cheating on her, brothels.\"\n\nAnd when she challenged him, David remembers his father questioned her sanity: \"'Sally, you are mad'. It was a mantra.\"\n\nThere were petty rules. In restaurants she was not allowed to speak to other people.\n\n\"He didn't like her having any independence in terms of friends, it was only friends together. It was total control.\"\n\nInsults about weight\n\nIf she displeased him, Richard would restrict her car use to work travel only, and all household spending came out of her earnings. Neighbours have said he treated her as if she belonged to him.\n\nAnd Sally was subjected to constant criticism.\n\n\"My father would refer to my mother as 'saddlebags', 'thunder thighs', really critiques of her weight... and that was something me and my brother witnessed and heard all the time. Not just in our own company but with other friends as well... It was just not right.\"\n\nAt the original trial, it was suggested Sally attacked Richard in a rage, after realising he had called a girlfriend that morning. But David says he believes his mother's claim that she was unaware of her actions when she killed Richard.\n\n\"She took that hammer and she killed my father. I recognise what happened but we have to recognise what psychological control does. I don't know why she took that hammer. She doesn't understand why,\" he says.\n\nDavid says his mother still loves Richard, something he and his brother \"can't understand\".\n\n\"We don't know what to do with that... my father's not alive any more and he still has power over her.\"\n\nDavid says he hopes the appeal \"will acknowledge my mother's mental abuse, will acknowledge what she suffered throughout her life\".\n\n\"The cause is not that she's a jealous wife,\" he adds. \"She has been manipulated psychologically all her life, tied down by this man, my father. She deserves her right to freedom.

They hope to use a law passed in 2015, which recognises psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse, to secure her release.\n\nImage caption David Challen says his mother suffered years of abuse at the hands of his father\n\nJust as physical violence in a relationship has been recognised as a mitigating factor in a killing, her lawyers say her history of psychological abuse by Richard provides a defence of provocation.\n\nThe circumstances around the killing itself give a taste of the sort of coercive control Richard exerted over his wife.\n\nIn the wealthy suburban village of Claygate, Surrey, one wet Saturday morning in August 2010, Sally visited the house she had, until recently, shared with Richard, her husband of 31 years.\n\nHe lived there alone since she had walked out on the relationship the previous November, after discovering he had been visiting prostitutes.\n\nDavid and his elder brother James, who prefers to avoid media attention, say their father inflicted years of psychological abuse on their mother. Having left Richard, the sons were adamant their mother should stay away from him.\n\nHowever, unknown to them, she had secretly begun seeing Richard again, hoping to patch up their marriage.\n\nWhat actually happened in the family home that morning was far removed from reconciliation.\n\nImage copyright Family handout Image caption Richard Challen was, outwardly, a loving family man\n\nOn this particular morning, she drove the short distance from her new home. In the car with her was a handbag and, stashed inside it, with her make-up and money, a hammer.\n\nRichard had wanted her to approve a post-nuptial agreement that would cut her rights to the \u00a31m family home and impose stringent conditions, such as not interrupting him and not talking to other people when they were together in restaurants.\n\nThere was no food in the house and Richard was hungry, so he asked her to go out and buy something for his lunch.\n\nAs she headed back from the shops, Sally suspected Richard had had an ulterior motive for getting her out of the house. So, on her return she picked up his phone, rang the last number he had dialled and found it answered by a woman.\n\nIn the family kitchen, Sally fried bacon and eggs on the hob. Richard sat with his back to her at the table.\n\nCounting Viagra pills\n\nShe served him, and, as he ate, she pulled the hammer from her bag and hit Richard 20 times over the head.\n\nShe then wrapped his body in curtains and blankets, left a note saying: \"I love you, Sally,\" and left.\n\nShe bought herself some cigarettes, drank some wine and composed a suicide note. But she decided to delay killing herself until she had seen David who, at 23, still lived with her.\n\nThe next day, David remembers, his mother dropped him at work and, as he stepped out of the car, she made her heartfelt pledge of love.\n\nLater that day, David was summoned by his manager.\n\n\"Then came round the corner, my cousin, followed by a police officer, uniformed, and rushed to me, grabbed me on both shoulders and said, 'your father's dead'.\"\n\nCharged with her husband's murder, 10 months later Sally stood in the dock of Guildford Crown Court. Her hair was a mess and her fingers stained yellow from smoking. David remembers the proceedings being hard to watch.\n\n\"Anyone standing up who had anything worth saying was not saying enough, or not feeling as if they had enough time, or not being asked the right questions. She was being painted as vengeful and jealous.\"\n\nHere was a woman who counted her husband's Viagra and monitored his phone calls, the prosecution said.\n\nIn court, Sally hardly spoke. But there was video evidence in which she admitted to the killing and testimony from the Beachy Head suicide prevention team. They recounted her confessing: \"I killed him with a hammer. I hit him lots of times... If I can't have him, no-one can.\"\n\nConvicted of murder and jailed for life, all hope appeared to have expired for Sally. Then, in 2015, a law came into force that recognised psychological manipulation, or coercive control, as a form of domestic abuse.\n\nImage copyright Family handout\n\nIn March, Sally Challen won leave to appeal against her conviction. Her lawyers argued her history of psychological abuse at the hands of Richard provided a defence of provocation.\n\nHer solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, thinks the new law should be accepted as \"new evidence\" in the case.\n\nShe believes this is the first time coercive control has been used as a defence in a murder appeal.\n\nIdeally, Ms Wistrich wants the conviction reduced to manslaughter. But she anticipates facing an argument that evidence of Richard's controlling behaviour had been available at the original trial.\n\nThe fact that the family want to see her freed and none of Richard's friends or relatives has come forward to say otherwise, is significant, she believes. But she fears the fact Sally brought the hammer with her \"with a conditional intent to use it\", suggests some premeditation. This could mean the murder conviction will stand, says Ms Wistrich.\n\nBoth grown-up sons back the legal challenge, with David clear that his father's treatment of his mother is a textbook example of coercive control.\n\n\"It was tick, tick, tick - everything: financial abuse, psychological manipulation, controlling her freedom of movement, just controlling every facet of her mind... It was almost like she was a robot and he punched in the commands of what she had to do.\"\n\nImage copyright Family handout Image caption Sally and Richard on their wedding day in 1979\n\nRichard's psychological hold over Sally began early, David believes.\n\nSally Jenney was 15 when she met Richard, five years her senior, in 1971. They were married in 1979. Sally had nothing but wide-eyed love for Richard, David says, but his father felt otherwise.\n\n\"Seeing women, cheating on her, brothels.\"\n\nAnd when she challenged him, David remembers his father questioned her sanity: \"'Sally, you are mad'. It was a mantra.\"\n\nThere were petty rules. In restaurants she was not allowed to speak to other people.\n\n\"He didn't like her having any independence in terms of friends, it was only friends together. It was total control.\"\n\nInsults about weight\n\nIf she displeased him, Richard would restrict her car use to work travel only, and all household spending came out of her earnings. Neighbours have said he treated her as if she belonged to him.\n\nAnd Sally was subjected to constant criticism.\n\n\"My father would refer to my mother as 'saddlebags', 'thunder thighs', really critiques of her weight... and that was something me and my brother witnessed and heard all the time. Not just in our own company but with other friends as well... It was just not right.\"\n\nAt the original trial, it was suggested Sally attacked Richard in a rage, after realising he had called a girlfriend that morning. But David says he believes his mother's claim that she was unaware of her actions when she killed Richard.\n\n\"She took that hammer and she killed my father. I recognise what happened but we have to recognise what psychological control does. I don't know why she took that hammer. She doesn't understand why,\" he says.\n\nDavid says his mother still loves Richard, something he and his brother \"can't understand\".\n\n\"We don't know what to do with that... my father's not alive any more and he still has power over her.\"\n\nDavid says he hopes the appeal \"will acknowledge my mother's mental abuse, will acknowledge what she suffered throughout her life\".\n\n\"The cause is not that she's a jealous wife,\" he adds. \"She has been manipulated psychologically all her life, tied down by this man, my father. She deserves her right to freedom. She deserves for her abuse to be recognised.\"\n\nImage copyright Family handout Image caption David says the only way to help his mother is to let her be free\n\nAdditional production by Judith Burns."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Men jailed after streaming joyride in bus", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-46751872", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:00:37", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The pair were arrested after their Facebook video was posted\n\nTwo men who live streamed themselves joyriding in a bus have each been jailed for four weeks.\n\nJames Jones and Johnathan Huckerby made off in the vehicle in Shepshed, Leicestershire, after the driver had stopped for a break.\n\nMagistrates heard that while police were searching for them, on the evening of 3 December, they posted a video on Facebook of the joyride.\n\nThe footage included both of their names and they were later arrested.\n\nJones, 27, of Armadale Drive, Leicester, and Huckerby, 28, of Pevensey Road, Loughborough, admitted taking the bus without consent.\n\n'Joke gone too far'\n\nKwok Wan, prosecuting, said: \"The driver turned off the engine and walked to take a break.\n\n\"When he returned, the bus was no longer there.\"\n\nThe two men had been drinking during the day, Leicester Magistrates' Court heard.\n\nHuckerby opened the door of the bus, and then egged on former bus driver Jones to drive off, the court was told.\n\nDarren Young, defending Huckerby, said the two men \"realised the severity\" of what had happened when a police car drove past before they parked the bus.\n\nKate Nield, defending Jones, said \"he can only apologise for what he's done\", calling it \"a joke which had gone too far\".\n\nJones also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance and Huckerby to possession of a class B drug.\n\nBecause both men received suspended jail sentences last year - Jones for \"violent offences\" and Huckerby for arson - the time they must serve is increased.\n\nOn top of the four-week sentences, Jones was jailed for another three months - and banned from driving for 30 weeks - and Huckerby for another eight weeks.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity.\n\nThe science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin, allowing them to identify variations in its composition.\n\nA third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon.\n\nWhat else might we learn from this mission?\n\nChang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nScientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A mock-up of the Chang'e-4 lander and rover, on display in Dongguan, China\n\nThe lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere.\n\nThe arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say.\n\nOther equipment/experiments include:\n\nA panoramic camera\n\nA radar to probe beneath the lunar surface\n\nAn imaging spectrometer to identify minerals\n\nAn experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nIs there a 'dark side of the Moon'?\n\nThe lunar far side is often referred to as the \"dark side\", though \"dark\" in this case means \"unseen\" rather than \"lacking light\". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime.\n\nBut because of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThe far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the \"maria\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nHow will scientists keep track of the rover?\n\nIn an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: \"The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.\"\n\nSo the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao - or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May.\n\nQueqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.\n\nWhat are China's plans in space?\n\nChina wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia.\n\nIn 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIt will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022.\n\nThe chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as \"an important milestone\" for the country's space effort, state media report.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A full-size model of the Tianhe core module of China's space station\n\nThe BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success.\n\nBut Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa.\n\n\"The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,\" he told the BBC.\n\nYe Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open.\n\n\"They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3.

The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.\n\nBut Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after.\n\nThe scientists have decided to call the larger lobe \"Ultima\", and the smaller lobe \"Thule\". The volume ratio is three to one.\n\nJeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: \"If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption Overall, Ultima Thule is dark, but there is quite a bit of brightness variation\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption One of the probe's instruments recorded the colour (L) of Ultima Thule. This has been laid over the high-resolution B&W image (C) to produce a combination (R)\n\nThe new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).\n\nIt has a tinge of colour, however. \"We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,\" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI.\n\n\"Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices.\" Essentially, its surface has been \"burnt\" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI Image caption The New Horizons team is celebrating an extraordinary achievement\n\nPrincipal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach.\n\nThe probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard.\n\n\"[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,\" the SwRI scientist said.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nLess than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft.\n\nThe best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JHU-APL/SWRI\n\nWhat's so special about the Kuiper belt?\n\nSeveral factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.\n\nOne is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.\n\nAnother factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of \"geological engine\" that in larger objects will rework their composition.\n\nAnd a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.\n\nUnlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.\n\nProf Stern said: \"Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.\"\n\nWhat does New Horizons do next?\n\nFirst, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nNew Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.\n\nThe longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.\n\nThe BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Anak Krakatau volcano: Satellites get clear view of collapse", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46743362", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Planet Labs, Inc.

But generation per person is now back down to the level of 1984 (around 5 megawatt hours per capita).\n\nHow much carbon has been reduced?\n\nIt\u2019s widely known that the great switch from coal power to renewables has helped the UK meet ambitions to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe report says the use of renewables reduced fossil fuel energy by the equivalent of 95 terawatt hours (TWh) between 2005 and now. And last year renewables supplied a record 33% share of UK electricity generation.\n\nBut in the meantime, humble energy efficiency has contributed to cutting energy demand by 103 TWh. In other words, in the carbon-cutting contest, efficiency has won \u2013 so far. And what\u2019s more, efficiency is uncontroversial, unlike wind and solar.\n\nWhat role has industry played?\n\nThe energy efficiency story doesn\u2019t just apply to households. There have been major strides amongst firms, too. Big supermarkets have worked hard to improve the performance of their lighting and refrigeration.\n\nAnd because firms and individuals are using less energy, that has offset the rise in energy prices. So whilst the prices have gone up, often bills have gone down.\n\nThe issue is complicated, though. Other factors have to be taken into account, such as energy imported via cables from mainland Europe, population growth and shifts from old energy-intensive industries.\n\nShould 'Cinderella' efficiency be allowed to shine?\n\nSimon Evans from Carbon Brief told BBC News: \u201cAlthough the picture is complex it\u2019s clear that energy efficiency has played a huge role in help the UK to decarbonise \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got the recognition it should have.\n\n\"Say you change from a B or C-rated fridge to an A++ rated fridge. That can halve your energy use from the appliance, so it\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\n\nThe UK government has consistently said it champions energy efficiency, but campaigners say it could do more. The UN\u2019s climate body also supports energy efficiency as a major policy objective, although the issue features little in media coverage.\n\nBut supporters of efficiency argue that ratcheting up efficiency standards for everything from planes and cars to computer displays and freezers offers the best-value carbon reductions without the pain of confronting the public with restrictions on their lifestyle choices.\n\nJoanne Wade from the Association for Conservation of Energy told BBC News: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen these figures before but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\n\u201cThe huge improvement in energy efficiency tends to be completely ignored. People haven\u2019t noticed it because if efficiency improves, they are still able to have the energy services that they want. I suppose I should reluctantly agree that the fact that no-one notices it is part of its appeal.\u201d\n\nScientists will be keen to point out that government-imposed energy efficiency is just one of a host of cures needed to tackle the multi-faceted problem of an overheating planet.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Warming seas linked to bluefin tuna surge in UK waters", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46738175", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nGrowing numbers of bluefin tuna are being seen in the waters around the UK because of the warming impact of a long term ocean current say researchers.\n\nThese large, speedy fish are a globally endangered species and almost disappeared from the UK around 40 years ago.\n\nScientists say that their recent rise is connected to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).\n\nNow in a warm phase, the current makes UK waters more hospitable for the fish.\n\nBluefin tuna are one of the largest and fastest fish on the planet - they can weigh up to 900kg and can travel at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour (43mph).\n\nIn the 1930s, the species was a common sight in the seas off Scarborough and was highly prized by big-game fishers.\n\nHowever, from the 1940s, the species began to decline and by the early 1990s had all but disappeared.\n\nBut over the past five years or so, sightings of the warm blooded fish have increased off the UK once again with many of these encounters captured on social media.\n\nThis situation has been mirrored in the Nordic seas, in the waters between Greenland and Norway which witnessed a spectacular collapse in tuna numbers in the 1960s, when the fish declined dramatically in just two years.\n\nResearchers now believe that the warming and cooling impact of the long term current, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is key to the ebb and flow of the species.\n\nThe scientists' new paper has been published in the journal Science Advances. The team looked at the changing abundance and distribution of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic over the past 200 years.\n\nThey've concluded that the major factor influencing the movement of bluefin is the AMO.\n\n\"The ecological effects of the AMO have long been overlooked and our results represent a breakthrough in understanding the history of bluefin tuna in the North Atlantic,\" said lead author Dr Robin Faillettaz from the University of Lille.\n\nHe believes that while current numbers of sightings of the UK may indicate that the species is doing well, this may not be the case everywhere.\n\n\"When water temperature increases during a positive AMO, bluefin tuna move further north. However, the most positive (warming) phases of the AMO also have a detrimental effect upon recruitment in the Mediterranean, which is currently the most important spawning ground, and that will affect adult abundance a few years later.\"\n\n\"If the AMO stays in a highly positive phase for several years, we may encounter more bluefin tuna in our waters but the overall population could actually be decreasing.\"\n\nWhat is the AMO?\n\nIt's a measure of a naturally occurring climate cycle in the North Atlantic that see sea surface temperatures rise and fall over long time periods.\n\nApproximately every 60 to 120 years the AMO switches between positive and negative phases. During positive (warm) phases, Ireland and the UK experience warmer weather but it also brings more hurricanes and drives drought in the US midwest. A cooler AMO can lead to drought in many parts of Africa.\n\nWill tuna fishing be allowed in the UK again?\n\nRight now the fishing of bluefin tuna in British waters is prohibited. But the recent rise in bluefin numbers has encouraged campaigners to petition the government to allow amateur fishers to catch the endangered species.\n\nThe Angling Trust want to establish a \"catch and release\" licensed fishery which they believe would have enormous economic benefits for areas such as Cornwall.\n\nBut the scientists involved with the latest study are cautious about this approach.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bluefin numbers in the Mediterranean have declined while increasing around the UK\n\n\"Bluefin tuna have been extensively overfished during the 20th century and the stock was close to its lowest in 1990, a fact that further indicates the recent changes in distribution are most likely environmentally driven rather than due to fisheries management and stock recovery,\" said co-author Dr Richard Kirby from the Secchi Disk Foundation.\n\n\"Before we further exploit bluefin tuna either commercially or recreationally for sport fishing, we should consider whether it would be better to protect them by making the UK's seas a safe space for one of the ocean's most endangered top fish.\"\n\nWhat about climate change?\n\nAccording to experts, the impact of global warming on top of the AMO is likely to alter the familiar patterns seen in bluefin tuna over several hundred years.\n\nThe authors believe that increasing global temperatures may see the species persist for longer in cooler waters around the UK and in the Nordic seas.\n\nIt might also cause the fish to disappear from the Mediterranean sea, the world's most important bluefin fishery.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "New Year\u2019s Resolution", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/new-year-s-resolution-1831408235", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Each year, Americans celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve by resolving to change some aspect of their lives.

Amid US air attacks and artillery fire by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), civilians and family members of ISIL fighters fled to villages to the south, the sources said. While Al Kashmah has not yet fallen, the only people remaining there are fighters representing what has become the front line of the war against ISIL in Deir Az Zor province.\n\nThe ISIL fighters are clustered in villages along the Euphrates, from the border with Iraq to south of Hajin, a former ISIL stronghold that fell to the SDF, a Kurdish-led militia, in mid-December.\n\nThere are about 50,000 to 60,000 people who remain in those areas, according to a civilian activist in Deir Az Zor who documents rights abuses and asked not to be named due to safety concerns. \"The civilians in these areas have no place to go or hide from the US bombardment of their villages,\" the activist said, noting that the residents have been harmed at the hands of the Syrian government, the US, and ISIL alike.\n\nBombing of hospital\n\nThe ISIL-held villages along the Euphrates have been the targets of US bombing sorties since November as part of Operation Roundup. In addition to military targets, Operation Roundup bombed civilian areas, including a hospital, The Intercept and Al Jazeera reported last month.\n\nThe US could not attack the hospital without warning it first \u2014 and without giving the hospital a reasonable amount of time to either stop ISIS from using it or to evacuate civilian personnel and wounded. Kevin Jon Heller, professor of international law\n\nA senior ISIL fighter said the al Yarmouk Hospital was the region\u2019s last public health facility that treated civilians in the area. He also acknowledged that ISIL might have used it to treat its fighters if treatment was not available in its own field hospitals.\n\nKevin Jon Heller, an international law scholar, told Al Jazeera that the US could not legally attack the hospital simply because it believes some ISIL fighters were there.\n\n\"The US could not attack the hospital without warning it first \u2014 and without giving the hospital a reasonable amount of time to either stop ISIL from using it or to evacuate civilian personnel and wounded,\" said Heller, a professor of international law at Australia National University and the University of Amsterdam\n\nHeller said the bombing of a hospital in a combat zone without considering the civilian casualties or warning them is a fundamental violation of International Humanitarian law (IHL), a component of international law that regulates the conduct of war and the protection of civilians.\n\nTrump's abrupt December 19 decision to withdraw US ground troops involved in the fight against ISIL in Syria took even the US Defense Department by surprise. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the president declined to give a timeline for the pullout, and said instead that it would happen \"over a period of time.\" The increased intensity of the bombings, however, belie claims by Trump and others that ISIL has been defeated or that the US war in Syria, which has largely been carried out from the skies, is over. It remains unclear whether US air attacks will continue once the troops leave.\n\nDuring the final days of 2018, the US campaign bombed villages up and down the Euphrates, focusing primarily on Al Kashmah. On the night of New Year's Eve, the bombs relentlessly assaulted Al Kashmah, leaving the village largely destroyed by the next morning, according to an ISIL fighter who was there. (We interviewed members of ISIL and the SDF, as well as a tribal leader, for this article via messaging services, and we've granted them anonymity because they all stand to be targeted by the various warring factions for speaking to journalists.)\n\nThe coalition against ISIL appears to be targeting internet cafes, according to two sources on the ground. Internet cafes in the villages are used by civilians and ISIL fighters alike. They are not part of ISIL\u2019s tactical communications infrastructure, according to sources, but the fighters typically use them to communicate with the outside world, especially their families in other countries.\n\n\"They just like to disrupt and mess everything up,\" an ISIL fighter said in an interview. \"They bombed the places where they sell gasoline for the motor, or they sell cooking oil, or where they filter the water - they bomb all these places. Not just the net, they bomb everything just to make your life horrible.\"\n\nThe risk of civilian casualties from bombings in Deir Az Zor is high because the rural villages have become densely populated with the families of ISIL fighters and civilians fleeing in recent months from more densely populated cities and towns that have fallen to Kurdish-led forces. \"No building is empty here,\" the ISIL fighter said, referring to the remaining ISIL-controlled villages in Deir Az Zor. Fighters and civilians in the villages have reportedly been describing the US bombing campaign as a scorched-earth policy, using an Arabic term that translates to \"burn the ground\".\n\nOn Sunday, the US military admitted that it\u2019s killed 1,139 civilians in Iraq and Syria since the start of its campaign against ISIL in 2014. That number is significantly smaller than the estimates of civilian casualties put out by monitoring groups, like Airwars, which says between 7,308 and 11,629 civilians have been killed.\n\nIn response to a list of questions about the bombings in Syria, Danielle Covington, a spokesperson for US Department of Defense, said the coalition dictates \"the pace of our strikes against ISIS targets deliberately and with careful consideration of their impact to civilians. The increase in strikes in late December were selected specifically to degrade ISIS capabilities and were unrelated to any other variable.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's withdrawal announcement, the Kurds, who lead the on-the-ground forces that had partnered with the US in fighting ISIL in Syria, reached out to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for protection. Feeling betrayed by the US, the Kurds are concerned about a possible attack by Turkey, which has long feared that its own minority Kurdish population might be emboldened by the existence of a Kurdish state or autonomous region south of Turkey. (In March 2018, Turkish Armed Forces and allied militia seized control of the Syrian city of Afrin from the Kurds.)\n\nIn addition, after the evacuation of civilians from Al Kashmah, ISIL negotiated a three-day ceasefire with the Kurds, according to three sources on the ground. On Monday, seven trucks carrying food and humanitarian aid entered ISIL-controlled areas under the agreement, according to one ISIL and one SDF source. The ceasefire was initially scheduled to end December 31, but ISIL officials are discussing a possible six-month extension, according to an ISIL fighter familiar with the talks but who is not directly part of the effort. During the temporary ceasefire, some ISIL fighters and defectors fled Deir Az Zor to other parts of Syria, according to two sources who made such journeys themselves.\n\nA lasting ceasefire would allow badly-needed supplies to reach civilians in the villages, and ISIL would also use it to regroup. The Kurds would receive a safeguard from a two-front war if the Turks attack.\n\nA ceasefire between ISIL and the Kurds, coupled with the Syrian government's potential protection of the Kurds from Turkey, would largely undercut part of Trump's public rationale for withdrawing US troops from Syria. In a tweet, Trump described how Turkey could \"easily take care of whatever remains\" of ISIL. In a subsequent tweet, Trump spoke of his conversation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey:\n\nPresident @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right \u201cnext door.\u201d Our troops are coming home! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018\n\nBut the prospect of Turkey's completion of a clean-up job against ISIL in Syria seems increasingly unlikely given the rapidly shifting alliances there.\n\nMeanwhile, the US military continues to drop bombs on Deir Az Zor, despite the fact that the Kurds, expected to be abandoned by the US, are not currently engaging ISIL fighters.\n\n\"They\u2019ve backstabbed all their allies and they\u2019re killing the people here, and eventually the Islamic State will survive and spread or it will fall,\" the ISIL fighter said, referring to the US. \"But there will be people here who will remember what happened here, and they will carry on this information and it will spread throughout the Middle East.\"\n\nFollow Ali Younes on Twitter: @ali_reports"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Al Jazeera captures evidence of food aid stolen in Yemen war", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/al-jazeera-captures-evidence-food-aid-stolen-yemen-war-190103161522796.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Al Jazeera has seen evidence of food meant for starving Yemenis being sold at a marketplace in the capital Sanaa.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has accused both Houthis and the Saudi-UAE coalition backed forces of diverting aid in areas under their control.\n\nAl Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom reports."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "India responds to Trump's 'Afghan library' dig at PM Modi", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/india-responds-trump-afghan-library-dig-pm-modi-190103134757592.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "India has rejected US President Donald Trump's comments mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for funding a library in Afghanistan, saying New Delhi has provided $3bn in development assistance to the war-torn country.\n\nThe US president on Wednesday took a swipe at what he said were Modi's frequent comments about building the library: \"You know what that is?

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Democrats Take Control of US House", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-control-new-us-congress/4727524.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "1 House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is applauded by U.S. Rep.

Cigarettes, food, drink and cellphones are all not allowed under House rules.\n\nMembers of the House do have one advantage over their Senate colleagues \u2014 they have always been allowed to bring their children onto the House floor.\n\nThis is not the first time a member has tried to end the head-covering ban. In 2010, an incoming Democratic House member, Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida, unsuccessfully lobbied House Speaker John Boehner for an end to the rule. Wilson \u2014 who is known for her colorful, often-sequined hats \u2014 told the Miami Herald the rule was sexist.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt dates back to when men wore hats, and we know that men don't wear hats indoors. But women wear hats indoors,\u201d she said.\n\nHead coverings have also been used as a form of protest on the House floor. In 2012, Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois was escorted off the floor for wearing a hooded sweatshirt. The so-called \u201choodie\u201d was meant to protest the death of Trayvon Martin, a teenager who was shot and killed in Florida by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watch guard.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, the Somali-born Omar announced she would be seek an end to the ban. \u201cNo one puts a scarf on my head but me,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAlong with Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Omar is co-authoring a proposal that would allow an exception to the rule for religious or medical headwear. This protection of religious expression would also apply to any members of a range of religious faiths, including Jews who wish to wear yarmulkes or Sikhs who want to wear turbans.\n\nThe Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) applauded the change last November, saying the rule was a violation of the freedoms protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe support the effort to update this anachronistic policy and to bring the House of Representatives into conformity with the Constitution and its existing protection of religious freedom,\u201d CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.\n\nThe rule would not cover members like Rep. Wilson who choose to wear hats for fashion."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "In New US Congress, Each Party Controls a Chamber", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/in-new-us-congress-each-party-controls-a-chamber/4726935.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Divided government returns to the United States Thursday with the swearing-in of a new Congress.\n\nAfter two years in which Republicans controlled the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives, Democrats will be the majority in the House.\n\nThat is the result of the November midterm elections in which Democrats made big gains to end up with 235 seats in the 435-seat House when the new members take office.

It is 1 billion miles (1.6 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, based on early, fuzzy images taken the day before, scientists said Ultima Thule resembled a bowling pin. But when better, closer pictures arrived, a new consensus emerged Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"The bowling pin is gone. It's a snowman!\" lead scientist Alan Stern informed the world from Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory , home to Mission Control. The bowling pin image is \"so 2018,\" joked Stern, who is with the Southwest Research Institute.\n\n\n\nThe celestial body was nicknamed Ultima Thule \u2014 meaning \"beyond the known world\" \u2014 before scientists could say for sure whether it was one object or two. With the arrival of the photos, they are now calling the bigger sphere Ultima and the smaller one Thule.\n\n\n\nThule is estimated to be 9 miles (14 kilometers) across, while Ultima is thought to be 12 miles (19 kilometers).\n\n\n\nScientist Jeff Moore of NASA's Ames Research Center said the two spheres formed when icy, pebble-size pieces coalesced in space billions of years ago. Then the spheres slowly spiraled closer to each other until they gently touched \u2014 as slowly as parking a car here on Earth at just a mile or two per hour \u2014 and stuck together.\n\n\n\nDespite the slender connection point, the two lobes are \"soundly bound\" together, according to Moore.\n\n\n\nScientists have ascertained that the object takes about 15 hours to make a full rotation. If it were spinning fast \u2014 say, one rotation every three or four hours \u2014 the two spheres would rip apart.\n\n\n\nStern noted that the team has received less than 1 percent of all the data stored aboard New Horizons. It will take nearly two years to get it all.\n\n\n\nThe two-lobed object is what is known as a \"contact binary.\" It is the first contact binary NASA has ever explored. Having formed 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system taking shape, it is also the most primitive object seen up close like this.\n\n\n\nAbout the size of a city, Ultima Thule has a mottled appearance and is the color of dull brick, probably because of the effects of radiation bombarding the icy surface, with brighter and darker regions.\n\n\n\nBoth spheres are similarly red, while the barely perceptible neck connecting the two lobes is noticeably less red, probably because of particles falling down the steep slopes into that area.\n\n\n\nSo far, no moons or rings have been detected. And scientists said there were no obvious impact craters in the latest photos but a few apparent \"divots\" and suggestions of hills and ridges. But better images should yield definitive answers in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n\n\nClues about the surface composition of Ultima Thule should start rolling in by Thursday. Scientists believe the icy exterior is probably a mix of water, methane and nitrogen, among other things.\n\n\n\nThe snowman picture was taken a half-hour before the spacecraft's closest approach early Tuesday, from a distance of about 18,000 miles (28,000 kilometers).\n\n\n\nUltima Thule is an exquisite time machine \u2014 the most primitive object ever seen close up \u2014 that should provide clues to the origins of our solar system.\n\n\n\nIt's neither a comet nor an asteroid, according to Stern, but rather \"a primordial planetesimal.\" Unlike comets and other objects that have been altered by the sun over time, Ultima Thule is in its pure, original state: It's been in the deep-freeze Kuiper Belt on the fringes of our solar system from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\"This thing was born somewhere between 99 percent and 99.9 percent of the way back to T-zero (liftoff) in our solar system, really amazing,\" Stern said. He added: \"We've never seen anything like this before. It's not fish or fowl. It's something that's completely different.\"\n\n\n\nStill, he said, when all the data comes in, \"there are going to be mysteries of Ultima Thule that we can't figure out.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Women Strive to End Genital Mutilation\u00a0in Kurdish Iraq", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/women-strive-to-end-genital-mutilation-in-kurdish-iraq/4726195.html", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Dark skies were threatening rain over an Iraqi Kurdistan village, but one woman refused to budge from outside a house where two girls were at risk of female genital mutilation.\n\n\n\n\"I know you're home!

When eight women entered the mosque, she patiently described FGM's dangers.\n\n\n\nAt the end, a thin woman approached Rasul and said her neighbor was planning to mutilate her two toddlers.\n\nThat sent Rasul clambering up the muddy pathway to the house, first knocking, then frantically demanding to be allowed in.\n\n\n\nBut the door remained shut.\n\n\n\n\"We are changing people's convictions. That's why it's so hard,\" Rasul told AFP, reluctantly walking away.\n\n\n\n'Just a child'\n\n\n\nFGM appears to have been practiced for decades in Iraq's Kurdish region, usually known for more progressive stances on women's rights.\n\n\n\nVictims are usually between 4 and 5 years old but are affected for years by bleeding, extremely reduced sexual sensitivity, tearing during childbirth, and depression.\n\n\n\nThe procedure can prove fatal, with some girls dying from blood loss or infection.\n\n\n\nAfter years of campaigning, Kurdish authorities banned FGM under a 2011 domestic violence law, slapping perpetrators with up to three years in prison and a roughly $80,000 fine.\n\n\n\nThe numbers have dropped steadily since.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, a U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) survey found 58.5 percent of women in the Kurdish region had been mutilated.\n\n\n\nThis year, UNICEF found a lower rate: 37.5 percent of girls aged 15-49 in the Kurdish region had undergone FGM.\n\n\n\nIt compares with less than 1 percent across the rest of Iraq, which has no FGM legislation.\n\n\n\n\"She cut me, I was hurt and cried,\" said Shukriyeh, 61, of the day her mother mutilated her more than 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\"I was just a child. How could I be angry at my mother?\"\n\n\n\nShukriyeh's six daughters, the youngest of whom is 26, have all been cut, too. But with so much campaigning against FGM, they have declined to do the same to their girls.\n\nYears ago, Zeinab, 38. allowed female relatives to cut her eldest daughter, then 3.\n\n\n\n\"I was so scared that I stayed far away and came to wash her after they cut her,\" she recalled, squirming.\n\n\n\nAfter WADI's sessions, she protected her other two daughters from mutilation.\n\n\n\n\"At the time I accepted [it], but now I wouldn't. Yes, I regret it. But what can I do now?\"\n\n\n\n'Women against women'\n\nRasul told AFP it was hard to combat a form of gender-based violence that women themselves practiced.\n\n\n\n\"Young men and women agree FGM should stop. But after we leave a village, older women talk to them and tell them: 'Be careful, that NGO wants to spread problems,' \" she said.\n\n\n\nUNICEF's 2014 survey found 75 percent of women saw their own mothers as the most supportive of cutting.\n\n\n\n\"I tell these women: This is violence that you're carrying out with your own hands \u2014 women against women,\" said Rasul.\n\n\n\nThat proximity has also made FGM victims less likely to seek justice.\n\n\"The 2011 law isn't being used because girls won't file a complaint against their mothers or fathers,\" said Parwin Hassan, who heads the Kurdish Regional Government's anti-FGM unit.\n\n\n\nHassan has wanted to work on the issue since she narrowly escaped it: Her mother pulled her away from their midwife after a last-minute change of heart.\n\n\n\n\"I've been working on women's issues since 1991, but this is the most painful for me.

But the company is unprofitable for the first nine months of 2018, and cash flow remains a concern for investors.\n\nPressure to deliver on promise\n\nMusk has been under intense pressure to deliver on his promise of stabilizing production for the Model 3, which is seen crucial for easing a cash crunch and achieving long-term profitability. It said it was churning out almost 1,000 Model 3s daily, broadly in line with Musk's promises but slightly short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe company said it would begin delivering Model 3s to Europe and China in February.\n\nThe price cut of $2,000 beginning on Wednesday on the Model 3 \u2014 as well as on its higher-priced Model S and Model X \u2014 took the market by surprise and weighed on the stock, pushing it down 9.4 percent in morning trade. Shares were last down 6.7 percent at $310.48.\n\nThe price cut comes as automakers expect U.S. new vehicle sales to weaken in 2019, and increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants. Tesla sales benefited from a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles throughout 2018, but that full credit expired at the end of 2018, and new buyers will now receive only half that amount.\n\nUnder a major tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in 2017, tax credits that lower the cost of electric vehicles are available for the first 200,000 such vehicles sold by an automaker. The tax credit is then reduced by 50 percent every six months until it phases out.\n\n\"The price cut is what's driving the stock lower, as it openly acknowledges the sunset of subsidy dollars is a material headwind,\" said Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners.\n\nBut some said fears of eroded demand were overblown. Gene Munster of Loup Ventures calculated that the lowered tax credit equaled, on average, to a 3-percent discount on a Tesla. If Tesla had a demand issue, therefore, the company would have cut its prices by more than 3 percent, he wrote in a note.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, General Motors said it had sold its 200,000th electric vehicle in 2018, similarly triggering a phase-out of the federal tax credit, according to a source.\n\nEffect on profit?\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett estimated in a client note that if Tesla continues to deliver cars at the current rate, the price cut will mean $700 million in lost revenue in 2019.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives, meanwhile, said the price cut was \"a potential positive\" for demand, \"but not what the bulls wanted to hear on the impact to profitability and ultimately the bottom line.\"\n\nTesla delivered 63,150 Model 3s in its fourth quarter, falling short of FactSet estimates of 64,900. Tesla said that based on its own compilation of analysts' forecasts, its delivery numbers were in line with market expectations.\n\nBank of America analyst John Murphy wrote that the numbers were in line with market consensus, though below the bank's estimate of 71,500 Model 3s.\n\nDeliveries rise, forecasts missed\n\nTotal deliveries rose from the third quarter to 90,700 cars, but missed forecasts, which had been influenced by analysts' expectations of a surge in buyers looking to cash in on the tax credit before year-end.\n\nThe automaker's third-quarter pre-tax profit was around $3,200 per vehicle delivered, but for the first nine months of 2018 the company suffered a third-quarter loss per vehicle delivered of $8,019, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nOverall, total production rose 8 percent to 86,555 vehicles. The company churned out 61,394 Model 3s, up from a total of 53,239 Model 3s in the third quarter.\n\n\"Tesla disappointed the market. The deliveries are below our estimates and the consensus estimates.

It also did not explain why seven other suspects arrested over the Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul did not immediately face formal charges. The kingdom previously announced 18 people had been arrested.\n\nSaudi officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi, who wrote columns critical of Prince Mohammed, has strained the decades-long ties the kingdom enjoys with the United States. It also has added to a renewed international push to end the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency and state television gave few details about the hearing.\n\n\u201cThe Public Prosecutor demanded imposing proper punishments against the defendants and is seeking capital punishment for five of the defendants for their direct involvement in the murder,\u201d a statement from prosecutors said, without elaborating.\n\nThe suspects requested copies of the indictments they faced, as well as asked for more time to prepare for their case, prosecutors said.\n\nWhile vague on details about the case, prosecutors made a point to express concerns about Turkey. They alleged that Turkish officials did not answer two formal requests made for evidence in the case.\n\n\u201cTo date, the Saudi Public Prosecutor has not received any response, and the Public Prosecution is still awaiting their response,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOfficials in Ankara could not be immediately reached for comment. Turkish officials have previously said they shared evidence with Saudi Arabia and other nations over Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nTurkey also has demanded Saudi Arabia extradite those 18 suspects to be tried there for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Turkish security officials have kept up a slow leak of videos, photographs and morbid details surrounding Khashoggi\u2019s slaying to pressure the kingdom, as the two U.S.-allied countries vie for influence over the wider Mideast.\n\nTurkish media have published photographs of members of the crown prince\u2019s entourage at the consulate in Istanbul ahead of the slaying. Khashoggi\u2019s body, believed to have been dismembered after his killing, has yet to be found.\n\nKhashoggi, 59, entered the consulate Oct. 2 as his fianc\u00e9e waited outside. But unbeknownst to him, a team of Saudi officials had flown in before his arrival and laid in wait for him.\n\nSaudi Arabia denied for weeks that Khashoggi had been killed but later changed its story and ultimately acknowledged the brutal slaying. King Salman ordered the restructuring of the country\u2019s intelligence service, but has so far shielded Prince Mohammed, his 33-year-old son who is next in line to the throne in the oil giant kingdom.\n\nAll that has not has not stopped widespread international criticism against the kingdom. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has seen the arrest of business leaders, royals and activists while also recently granting women the right to drive.\n\nU.S. senators in December passed the measure that blamed the prince for Khashoggi\u2019s killing and called on Riyadh to \u201censure appropriate accountability.\u201d Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Both measures drew angry responses from the kingdom, but a renewed international effort has begun to end the Yemen war.\n\nIt is no surprise that the kingdom would seek to execute those accused in Khashoggi\u2019s slaying. Saudi Arabia was the world\u2019s third top executioner in 2017, behind China and Iran, according to Amnesty International\u2019s most recent figures available.\n\nThe kingdom executed at least 146 people, according to the group. It regularly beheads those condemned to death and last year said it \u201ccrucified\u201d a Myanmar man, an execution in which the condemned is usually beheaded and then the body put on display, arms outstretched as if crucified.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "China Becomes First Country To Land A Spacecraft On The Far Side Of The Moon", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-lands-spacecraft-far-side-moon_us_5c2da202e4b08aaf7a95d583", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "China became the first nation to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, the country\u2019s state-run media announced Thursday, a milestone that solidifies Beijing\u2019s ambitions to become a world leader in space exploration.\n\nThe probe, dubbed the Chang\u2019e-4, touched down at 10:26 a.m. Beijing time, landing on the moon\u2019s dark side, which forever faces away from the Earth.

They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper.\n\nAcross India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cHe was drunk,\u201d said one nun, beginning her story. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to say no,\u201d said another.\n\nAt its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them.\n\nThe Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year.\n\nNow, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country \u2014 India \u2014 and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people \u2014 nuns, former nuns and priests, and others \u2014 said they had direct knowledge of such incidents.\n\nStill, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest\u2019s sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified.\n\nBut this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open.\n\nWhen repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India\u2019s Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop\u2019s arrest.\n\nIt was an unprecedented action, dividing India\u2019s Catholic community. Inside the accuser\u2019s convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out.\n\n\u201cSome people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, \u2018You are worshipping Satan,\u2019\u201d said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. \u201cBut we need to stand up for the truth.\u201d\n\nVilloonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church.\n\n\u201cWe want to die as sisters,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nSome nuns\u2019 accounts date back decades \u2014 like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s.\n\nIt was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her \u2014 happily \u2014 to convent life.\n\n\u201cWe have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,\u201d she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. \u201cWe take one week off and we go for prayers and silence.\u201d\n\nShe had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection.\n\nThe nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India\u2019s poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families.\n\nBut when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she\u2019s afraid to be overheard in the empty room: \u201cI felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction.\u201d\n\nHe was in his 60s. She was four decades younger.\n\nOne night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room.\n\n\u2033\u2018I need to meet you,\u2019\u201d he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not stable. I\u2019m not ready to meet you,\u201d she told him.\n\nBut the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could.\n\nWeeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: \u201cIt was such a terrifying experience.\u201d\n\nAfterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned.\n\nBut nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career.\n\nShe was too afraid to challenge him openly.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was risking my own vocation.\u201d\n\nSo the fierce nun remained silent.\n\n___\n\nCatholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her.\n\n\u201cIt is a sin!\u201d Maria is said to have cried out. \u201cGod does not want it!\u201d\n\nBut for a nun, fighting off a priest\u2019s advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience \u2014 even if it\u2019s forced \u2014 faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,\u201d said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. \u201cThat fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone.\n\nThen there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes.\n\nCaught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,\u201d said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. \u201cIt can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman.\n\n\u201cOnce you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,\u201d said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. \u201cWe have a terrible taboo about sex.\u201d\n\nThat naivety, she said, can be costly.\n\nLike the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony.\n\nShe shook her head: \u201cI was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable.\u201d\n\nAt one point, she brought the priest\u2019s laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her.\n\nAt first, she had no idea what was happening.\n\n\u201cThe kissing was all coming here,\u201d she said, gesturing at her chest.\n\nThe confusion of that day is still clear on her face: \u201cI was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: \u2018Is this the way that Goans kiss?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe quickly understood what was happening but couldn\u2019t escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: \u201cI cannot shout! He\u2019s a priest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to offend him. I didn\u2019t want to make him feel bad,\u201d she said.\n\nSo she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door.\n\nShe quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest\u2019s room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint.\n\nA complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order.\n\nIn the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping.\n\nArchbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse \u201ckind of sporadic. Once here, once there.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cmany people don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey may talk in the community, but they don\u2019t want to bring it to the public, to the court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops.\n\nThe silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value.\n\nThere are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that\u2019s a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners.\n\n\u201cEven we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,\u201d said Mulackal, the theologian. \u201cA woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala.\n\nSet amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child\u2019s wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum.\n\nThe rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal.\n\nSmart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments.\n\nThe nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her.\n\nThe letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent\u2019s visitor logs.\n\nMulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were \u201cbaseless and concocted\u201d and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job.\n\n\u201cI am going through painful agony,\u201d said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. \u201cI tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail.\u201d\n\nCatholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners\u2019 faith: St. Mary\u2019s Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries.\n\nAround here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr.\n\nA string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. \u201cHearty Welcome!\u201d a banner proclaimed.\n\nBut at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf.\n\n\u201cNobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,\u201d said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls \u201cour survivor sister.\u201d\n\nThat sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher.\n\nShe knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser\u2019s friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship.\n\nIt was about fear.\n\n\u201cThe bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?\u201d asked Villoonnickal. \u201cIf she went home what will happen to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,\u201d she continued.\n\nEventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police.\n\nShe also went to confession.\n\nThere, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop.\n\n\u2033\u2018Even if you have to die, don\u2019t submit yourself.\u2019\u201d the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. \u201d\u2018Be courageous.\u2019\u201d\n\nCatholic authorities have said little about the case, with India\u2019s Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course.\n\n\u201cSilence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe request prayers for the Church at this difficult time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIn Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as \u201cMadhilu Chadi\u201d \u2014 Wall Jumpers. It\u2019s a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life.\n\nThose who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them.

The state is a major supplier of fruits and vegetables to the rest of the nation.\n\nThis story was produced and originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nBy Tom Philpott\n\nSo far, this winter has brought ample snows to the Sierra Nevada, the spine of mountains that runs along California\u2019s eastern flank. That\u2019s good news for Californians, because the range\u2019s melted snow provides 60 percent of the state\u2019s water supply. Anyone in the United States who likes fruit, vegetables, and nuts should rejoice, too, because water flowing from the Sierra\u2019s streams and rivers is the main irrigation source for farms in the arid Central Valley, which churns out nearly a quarter of the food consumed here.\n\nBut the Sierra snowpack has shown an overall declining trend for decades \u2014most dramatically during the great California drought of 2012-2016 \u2014 and will dwindle further over the next several decades, a growing body of research suggests. In the latest, published in the peer-reviewed Geophysical Research Letters journal, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers lay out what they call a \u201cfuture of consistent low-to-no snowpack.\u201d In other words, a new normal in which the robust snowpack developing this year would be an almost unthinkable anomaly.\n\nTo get a picture of what water planners can expect in the coming decades, the team focused on the headwaters feeding 10 major reservoirs designed to capture snowmelt from the Sierra each year. Using averages from 1985 to 2005 as a baseline, they applied nine different climate models. They assumed global greenhouse gas emissions would continue rising at present rates\u2014that is, a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario with no effective global deal to cut greenhouse emissions and no major technological breakthroughs.\n\nThe results: By mid-century (2039\u20132059), the average annual snowpack will fall by 54.4 percent compared to the late-20th century baseline. By the time today\u2019s teens are in their 70s, it will be 79.3 percent beneath the old standard. To analyze massive amounts of water, planners think in acre-feet\u2014the amount needed to submerge an acre of land by one foot. At the end of the last century, the Sierra Nevada captured an average of 8.76 million acre-feet. By mid-century, they project, the average will fall to 4 million acre-feet, and by century\u2019s end, 1.81 million acre-feet.\n\nThe Central Valley Project \u2014 a federally run network of dams, reservoirs, and canals that waters about a third of California\u2019s irrigated farmland and provides water and electricity to millions of urban users, all from snowmelt \u2014 could become what economists called a \u201cstranded asset\u201d in such a scenario: a multi-billion-dollar public investment that lacks sufficient water to perform its tasks.\n\nAs the authors note, these dire projections are roughly consistent with recent research from other scientists using different models and assumptions: see here, here, here, and here. And they also dovetail with the findings of California\u2019s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, released in August. \u201cAs a result of projected warming, Sierra Nevada snowpacks will very likely be eradicated below about 6,000 feet elevation and will be much reduced by more than 60% across nearly all of the range,\u201d the report found. The Fourth National Climate Assessment, released without fanfare by the Trump administration the day after Thanksgiving, offered similar warnings about fast-vanishing snowpacks in the West.\n\nThe bad news is piling up at a time when Central Valley farmers (egged on by the Trump administration) are already fighting with state managers for larger annual allocations of snowmelt, at least some of which has to flow into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta and to the Pacific. According to the Water Education Foundation, \u201c80 percent of the state\u2019s commercial fishery species live in or migrate through the Delta, and at least half of its Pacific Flyway migratory water birds rely on the region\u2019s wetlands.\u201d Its ecosystem already teeters near collapse, driven in part by relentless shunting of water to farm interests in the Central Valley."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "House Democrats Not Rushing To Get Trump's Tax Returns", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-returns-house-democrats_us_5c2e39ebe4b08aaf7a971c36", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "AP Photo/Steven Senne Rep.

Legally, he added, Neal\u2019s hesitation just delays a likely effort by Trump and the Treasury Department to drag a tax return request through the courts.\n\nFederal law says that in response to a written request from the Ways and Means chairman, the Treasury secretary \u201cshall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson told HuffPost last year that the department would review any such request to get the president\u2019s returns \u201cfor legality,\u201d strongly hinting that the Trump administration would not simply obey the law.

Democrats previously said they would try to obtain the returns if they won back the House of Representatives in November, which they did. Democrats assume control of the House on Thursday afternoon.\n\nOther Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee told HuffPost last month that they considered getting Trump\u2019s tax returns a top priority.

This includes getting real answers about the administration\u2019s family separation policy that ripped migrant children from their parents at the border and investigating the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2020 Census, the deployment of U.S. troops to the border and changes to asylum laws.\n\nRep.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition in 2016 and for failing to file as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey.

His refusal to divest from his business means that he still makes money when lobbyists, big corporations and foreign governments pay to use his properties. Trump\u2019s involvement in the decision not to move the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., has also raised concerns about a conflict of interest as the building is across the street from the president\u2019s hotel. Cummings and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), the new chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, will investigate these conflicts.\n\nThe House Ways & Means Committee plans to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2015 although maybe not immediately. Trump was the first major party presidential candidate since Richard Nixon to refuse to disclose his tax returns to the public. A New York Times investigation found that Trump likely committed tax fraud with his father, Fred Trump, when the elder Trump transferred nearly half a billion dollars to his son in a manner that evaded taxes.\n\n\u201cThere is popular demand for the Congress to request the president\u2019s tax returns,\u201d Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in December.\n\nTrump\u2019s Sidekicks\n\nAlmost every House committee will have the ability to dig into the widespread corruption that has characterized the Trump administration across practically every agency. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s conflict-ridden land deals with the oil-services company Halliburton and the casino operator MGM can be investigated now. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson\u2019s nepotism and cronyism are also fair game, as is the elevation of Matthew Whitaker from a non-Senate-confirmed aide who recently worked as a salesman for a company convicted of fraud and a pitchman for toilets designed for men with oversized genitals to the position of acting attorney general.\n\n\u201cI want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money, as well as President Trump\u2019s decisions to act in his own financial self-interest rather than the best interests of the American people,\u201d Cummings previously told HuffPost.\n\n\u2018Presidential Harassment\u2019\n\nTrump has already attempted to deflect these investigations by labeling them \u201cPresidential Harassment,\u201d a phrase initially coined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nAlthough every president has complained about congressional investigation, the practice of congressional oversight of the executive branch dates back to President George Washington\u2019s first term. In recent years, investigators have taken varying approaches from properly investigating policies and abuses to engaging in political theater and conspiracy mongering.\n\nFormer Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.) famously used his control of the oversight committee in the 1990s to follow every rumor and conspiracy theory about President Bill Clinton, whom he declared \u201ca scumbag.\u201d Burton believed that Clinton had ordered the assassination of White House lawyer Vince Foster (Foster committed suicide in 1993) and even re-enacted the invented murder by shooting a cantaloupe (or maybe a pumpkin or a watermelon) in his backyard.\n\nIn the 2000s, Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) separately helmed the oversight committee and undertook serious investigations of the George W. Bush administration \u2015 often with bipartisan support. Davis helped investigate the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandals, while Waxman investigated the 2008 market crash and the lies that led the U.S. to invade Iraq.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump has taken to calling any efforts by Democrats to investigate his administration \"Presidential Harassment.\"\n\nUnder Obama, Republican Darrell Issa (Calif.) wielded the oversight gavel in a unilateral manner by sending out more subpoenas than the previous three chairmen combined. Meanwhile, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the outgoing oversight chairman, led a special committee to investigate the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans during an attack in Benghazi, Libya. The investigation uncovered nothing new that multiple previous investigations had not revealed. Instead, the committee was used as a campaign tool against 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time of Stevens\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\u201d Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) admitted in 2015. \u201cBut we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?\u201d\n\nThe committee disbanded one month after Clinton lost the election.\n\nDemocrats hope to avoid the perception that their investigations are solely for political or electoral advantage \u2014 even if nothing will stop the president from labeling anything investigating him a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d That is one reason why the new committee chairs are reluctant to engage in any incipient discussions about impeachment.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether the president conspired with foreign countries including Russia to influence the 2016 election to his benefit has already netted numerous high-profile guilty pleas of Trump\u2019s national security adviser, foreign policy aide and his personal lawyer and fixer. It has also led to the revelation that Trump lied during his campaign that he \u201chad nothing to do with Russia\u201d when he actually pursued a deal with the Russian government to build a Trump Tower in Moscow up until June 2016.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s investigation is still ongoing.

Many are young and ideological with records of attacking abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights. Many were also recommended to Trump by the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t do much to stop McConnell from confirming objectionable nominees; Republicans have been blowing up Senate traditions that previously gave the minority some leverage.

One of the \u201cnot qualified\u201d nominees was withdrawn, and another is still pending.\n\nAll but one Republican voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite him wailing through his confirmation hearing about revenge-minded Democrats besmirching him.

Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) spearheaded a revolt against likely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing that the California lawmaker\u2019s ascent would \u201cjeopardize this hard-fought majority that we finally got\u201d of moderate women in suburban districts like hers.\n\nYet new polling suggests white, suburban women in Rice\u2019s own southwestern Long Island district could turn on the Democrat if she refuses to back a Green New Deal, the umbrella term for the sweeping policy to combat climate change and overhaul the economy that Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has championed.\n\nA survey of 300 likely Democratic primary voters in New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District described a Green New Deal as a plan \u201cto invest trillions of dollars into the development and distribution of green energy, creating millions of new high-wage jobs while preventing catastrophic climate change.\u201d The survey then told participants that Rice \u201cdoes not currently support a Green New Deal,\u201d and asked, \u201cHow does this information impact your vote in the 2020 Democratic primary for Congress?\u201d\n\nThe results suggest the overwhelming popularity of Green New Deal-style policies could propel upsets in districts beyond the diverse, left-leaning urban bastions that gave rise to socialist darlings like Ocasio-Cortez and others in her cohort. The findings also indicate potential challenges of selling moderate Democrats from more conservative districts on the populist branding of policies packaged in a Green New Deal.\n\nData for Progress\n\nForty-seven percent of survey respondents were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, while only 18 percent vowed to back someone who opposed the policy. Another 22 percent said support for a Green New Deal had no impact on their vote, and 13 percent were not sure.\n\nThe polling \u2015 conducted between Dec. 17 and Dec. 27 by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and shared exclusively with HuffPost \u2015 shows particularly strong support for a Green New Deal among women in the suburban portions of the Nassau County district abutting the New York City borough of Queens.\n\nForty-eight percent of women and 44 percent of men supported a pro-Green New Deal candidate. Yet 30 percent of men said they\u2019d back a candidate who opposed a Green New Deal, compared to just 10 percent of women who said the same.\n\nForty-nine percent of suburban voters in the district supported a Green New Deal candidate, compared to just 31 percent of urban voters. By contrast, 14 percent of suburban voters said they\u2019d support an anti-Green New Deal primary candidate, while 43 percent of urban voters said they\u2019d do the same.\n\nOlder voters, whites and Asians made up the strongest base of support for a pro-Green New Deal Democrat. Such a hypothetical candidate garnered 57 percent support from voters over 65 and 55 percent among voters aged 55 to 64.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Asian voters in the sample said they\u2019d support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, followed by 51 percent of whites, 39 percent of blacks and 33 percent of Hispanics.\n\n\u201cThe strongest margin of support are older suburban women,\u201d said Evan Roth Smith, co-founder of the polling firm Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. \u201cThat is the constituency for a Green New Deal in her district.\u201d\n\nRice did not join a handful of other Democrats in the New York delegation in supporting Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution for a select committee on a Green New Deal. But in a statement to HuffPost, Rice said she supports \u201crobust federal investment in energy-efficient infrastructure projects and training for green energy jobs\u201d and said \u201cmembers of Congress committed to this fight should no longer accept campaign contributions from oil and gas companies.\u201d\n\nIn my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\n\u201cFighting climate change isn\u2019t about politics, it\u2019s about protecting our homes and jobs and preserving our communities for future generations,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my view, there is no plan too bold or too ambitious.\u201d\n\nThe survey found Rice has a 70 percent approval rating \u2015 higher than Pelosi\u2019s, as The Washington Post first reported. Still, Nassau County activist Siela Bynoe said she is considering a primary challenge in 2020.\n\nThe polling is the first in a series surveying districts where incumbent Democrats could be vulnerable to a progressive primary challenge in 2020.\n\nRice, who has built a strong base of support over the last five years, has not faced a primary challenger since she made her inaugural bid in 2014. The former Nassau County prosecutor\u2019s votes in favor of environmental legislation and against deregulatory efforts earned her a 100 percent score on the League of Conservation Voters\u2019 2017 ranking. Her lifetime score is 95 percent.\n\nIn 2015, she crusaded against plans to build a liquefied natural gas terminal off the coast of Jones Beach. In 2017, she co-sponsored legislation to mandate 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Rice proposed legislation last year to prohibit members of Congress from serving on public companies\u2019 boards, and fought for more aid to victims still struggling to recover from 2012\u2032s Hurricane Sandy.\n\nBut Rice has long wooed Republicans. In the four years leading up to 2013, she accepted donations from Donald Trump totaling $53,000. Her father, a contractor who became the building commissioner of New York\u2019s Archdiocese, registered as a Republican after moving to once deep-red Nassau County. Because New York\u2019s primaries are closed to nonpartisans, he registered as a Democrat only when his daughter ran in a primary for district attorney, according to a New York Times profile from March 2014.\n\nRice won endorsements from a handful of GOP officials in her district in 2016. Since 2016, she\u2019s voted in favor of legislation Trump pushed just over 30 percent of the time, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, which predicted, based on Trump\u2019s support in her district, that figure would be closer to 48 percent.\n\nSunrise Movement Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) joined a protest led by the climate justice group Sunrise Movement in November, helping to propel a Green New Deal into the mainstream political debate.\n\nHer vulnerability to a challenge could speak to the changing nature of the Democratic electorate. Support for a Green New Deal unites disparate primary voters from the 2016 election. Among New York 4th Congressional District voters who picked Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016, 55 percent said they would support a pro-Green New Deal candidate, compared to 8 percent who wouldn\u2019t. Among voters who picked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, support for a Green New Deal proponent hit 46 percent, compared to 19 percent who don\u2019t.\n\nThe results mirror support for Ocasio-Cortez, whose surprise primary victory over the summer skyrocketed the 29-year-old to national fame. In Rice\u2019s district, 52 percent of those polls viewed Ocasio-Cortez favorably, of which 56 percent said they\u2019d support a Green New Deal proponent in a 2020 primary.\n\n\u201cOcasio-Cortez has clearly broken through,\u201d Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress, said by phone. \u201cPeople like Ocasio-Cortez are more than willing to primary a Democrat for not supporting a Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nBut reaching a point where there\u2019s enough \u201corganic buzz\u201d around a Green New Deal that it\u2019s a \u201ctopic of discussion beyond the direct actions of a primary opponent,\u201d will require a lot of work, said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive strategist.\n\nThe policy stormed into mainstream political debate over the past two months after activists staged sit-ins in Pelosi\u2019s office and Ocasio-Cortez proposed a resolution to establish a select committee charged with drafting a Green New Deal. Eighty-two percent of Americans said they had heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about a Green New Deal, yet 81 percent of registered voters said they supported the policies outlined under early proposals, according to a survey released last month by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University.\n\nNinety-two percent of Democrats supported the Green New Deal, including 93 percent of liberal Democrats and 90 percent of moderate-to-conservative Democrats. But, more surprisingly, 64 percent of Republicans backed the policy, including 75 percent of moderate-to-liberal Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans.\n\nThe poll found that as the policy becomes more associated with leftist politicians like Ocasio-Cortez, support among conservatives is likely to wane.\n\nMost of the Democrats likely to run for president in 2020 are now giving their support to a Green New Deal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who this week announced an exploratory committee for a potential bid, became the latest on Tuesday when she told Axios she supports the \u201cidea\u201d of a Green New Deal.\n\nBut convincing voters that punishing a Democrat like Rice who opposes the policy is \u201ca boon to a Green New Deal\u2019s chances of implementation\u201d is another challenge altogether, Hauser said.\n\n\u201cIt is seems more than plausible to me but rather very likely that if made salient to voters, opposition to a Green New Deal would be deeply dangerous for the primary chances of any incumbent Democrat,\u201d Hauser said by email. \u201cHowever the work of making it salient is no small task.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Emotional And Psychological Abuse Are Now Crimes In Ireland", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ireland-emotional-abuse-crime_us_5c2e1b60e4b0407e9088c6e5", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Barcroft Media via Getty Images Pro-choice campaigners stage a demonstration on June 5. 2018, in Parliament Square in London demanding the British Government decriminalizes abortion in Northern Ireland following the result of the referendum in the Republic of Ireland last month.\n\nIreland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.\n\nAs part of the country\u2019s Domestic Violence Act 2018, which went into effect on New Year\u2019s Day, \u201ccoercive control\u201d is now recognized as domestic violence and is punishable by up to five years in prison.

The average age was 41, with an average length of service of 15 years.\n\nFour states \u2013 California, Florida, New York, and Texas \u2013 had the highest number of officer suicides, with each state reporting at least 10 fatalities in 2018.\n\nBecause the federal government does not mandate the reporting of officer suicides, Blue H.E.L.P. must obtain and verify raw data from a number of sources, including individual law enforcement agencies and surviving family members.\n\n\u201cWe know there are other tragic deaths by suicide that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Steven Hough, co-founder of Blue H.E.L.P. \u201cSo as bad a number as we have this year, we\u2019re saddened by the fact that we know in reality the number is higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, law enforcement officers die by suicide at a higher rate than those in other occupations, aside from the military.

In some states, minimum wages will go up, guns will be harder to obtain, plastic straws will get the boot and hunters will get to wear pink for a change.\n\nHere are some of the noteworthy laws going into effect this year:\n\nTighter gun restrictions in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last February, thousands of protesters across the nation demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school last year, California passed several measures to prevent domestic abusers and people with mental illness from obtaining guns. Californians who are involuntarily committed to a mental institution twice in a year, or who are convicted of certain domestic violence offenses, could face a lifetime gun ownership ban.\n\nUnder an expanded Oregon law that went into effect on Jan. 1, domestic abuse offenders or people under restraining orders are banned from owning or purchasing a gun. In Illinois, authorities now have the right to seize firearms from people determined to be a danger to themselves or others. A similar \u201cred flag\u201d law will go into effect in New Jersey later this year.\n\nAt least six states \u2014 California, Washington, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois and Vermont \u2014 and the District of Columbia are raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of long guns this year, CNBC reported.\n\nWashington state will also be enforcing several other gun control measures, including enhanced background checks, secure gun storage laws and a requirement for gun purchasers to provide proof they\u2019ve undergone firearm safety training.\n\nNew \u2018Me Too\u2019 laws\n\nAP In 2018, the Me Too movement spurred many people to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment and abuse -- and prompted several states to pass new laws targeting sexual violence.\n\nSeveral states are taking aim at workplace sexual harassment. California has banned nondisclosure provisions in settlements involving claims of sexual assault, harassment or discrimination based on sex. California employers will also no longer be allowed to compel workers to sign nondisparagement agreements as a condition of employment or in exchange for a raise or bonus.\n\nBy the end of 2019, publicly held corporations in the Golden State will also need to have at least one woman on their board of directors. Depending on the size of the board, corporations will need to increase that number to at least two or three female board members by the end of 2021.\n\nIn New York, all employees will be required to complete annual sexual harassment prevention training. Larger businesses in Delaware will have to provide such training to their workers, and legislators and their staff in Virginia will need to undergo such training every year.\n\nMinimum wages get a boost\n\nThough the federal minimum wage has languished at $7.25 since 2009, at least 19 states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, will be raising their minimum wages this year. Each will boost its minimum wage to at least $12. Some cities like New York, Seattle and Palo Alto, California, will see their wage floors increase to $15.\n\nSo long straws and stirrers!\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Under a new California law, restaurant customers will have to explicitly ask for a plastic straw if they want to use one.\n\nAs public awareness mounts of the hazards of plastic waste pollution, cities and states around the country have been targeting a major source of the problem: single-use plastic products like straws and food containers.\n\nA new law in New York City bars restaurants, stores and manufacturers from using most foam products, including takeout containers, cups and packing peanuts.\n\nEateries in the District of Columbia are now prohibited from giving out single-use plastic straws and stirrers. In California, restaurant patrons will need to ask explicitly for a plastic straw if they want to use one. Restaurants can be fined $25 a day for serving beverages with plastic straws that aren\u2019t requested by customers.\n\nFormer felons in Florida can head to the voting booth\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In November, Florida voted to approve a ballot measure that enabled more than 1 million former felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Florida will restore the voting rights of all former felons except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. Some 1.4 million possible voters will be added to the rolls \u2014 an addition that could have a significant effect on elections in the swing state.\n\nUtah implements strictest DUI law in the country\n\nUtah has lowered its blood alcohol content standard for drunk driving to 0.05 percent \u2014 the lowest limit in the country.\n\nUnder the new law, a driver who exceeds that limit and causes the death of another person will be charged with criminal homicide, a felony offense.\n\nAs CNN notes, all other U.S. states have a blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.08 percent for noncommercial drivers. Since at least 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board has been pushing to lower the limit to 0.05 nationwide.\n\nPets to get more rights in California\n\nPets in California will no longer be treated by courts as physical property in divorce cases. Instead, judges can decide who gets custody of the family pet.\n\nUnder a separate California law, pet stores will no longer be allowed to sell cats, dogs or rabbits that aren\u2019t from animal shelters or nonprofit rescue groups. That law, which took effect on Jan. 1, also requires that store owners maintain proper documentation of the backgrounds of the dogs, cats and rabbits they sell.\n\nHawaii legalizes physician-assisted suicide\n\nHawaii\u2019s new law allowing physician-assisted suicide took effect on Tuesday.\n\nTobacco targeted in several states\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some states and cities are taking aim at tobacco products this year.\n\nSmoking will be banned at all New Jersey public beaches and parks starting in July.\n\nIn New York City, a new ordinance bans pharmacies from selling cigarettes and other tobacco products. And Massachusetts has raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.\n\nNonbinary people can list their gender as \u2018X\u2019 in NYC\n\nPeople who identify as neither male nor female can now list their gender as \u201cX\u201d on birth certificates in New York City.\n\nNew Jersey requires all residents to have health insurance\n\nA health insurance law in New Jersey that came into effect on Jan. 1 requires residents to maintain coverage or pay a penalty. It\u2019s the second state in the country, after Massachusetts, to enact an individual health insurance mandate.\n\nVermont is paying remote workers to move there\n\nIn an effort to promote economic growth, Vermont has offered to pay some remote workers to relocate to the state.\n\nQualified applicants can each apply for up to $10,000 in funding.

Disclosing these dealbreakers is often delightfully subtle and insignificant (e.g., I snore, I don\u2019t cook, I\u2019m sloppy and so on). It can also end a relationship \u2014 smoking, not wanting kids, infidelity ... so, what\u2019s my dating dealbreaker?\n\nI had a double mastectomy and don\u2019t have real boobs.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for just a second. I have a mutated BRCA1 gene, otherwise frightfully known as the \u201cbreast cancer gene.\u201d As its name suggests, having the mutation made my lifetime risk of getting breast cancer skyrocket up to 87 percent. That, and my family history of breast cancer put my depressing odds into clear context, and the logical plan of action was to simply slice my breasts off. This would reduce my risk of getting breast cancer to less than one percent ... so I had a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy.\n\nIn July 2018, at 25 years old, I parted ways with my real boobs at a hospital in Kansas. Two additional surgeries later, and my body is beginning to heal \u2013 which has unfortunately allowed the emotional toll of this process to finally rear its ugly head.\n\nWhile nothing about this has been easy, I found myself immensely struggling in the dating realm after the surgery. I had just had my real breasts cut off, and it was really doing a number on my relationship-potential conviction. I failed to summon the confidence needed to swipe away on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. The single men in the real world were seemingly few and far between, and knowingly approaching them seemed unimaginable after my mastectomy.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones.\n\nThe first time I told a prospective suitor that I had had a double mastectomy, I had done so with apologetic undertones and a slight curve of the spine \u2014 a direct reflection of my self-assurance (or lack thereof).\n\nBut how could I feel confident when I was wholeheartedly embarrassed by the jagged, pink scars on my underboob? How could I take a man home with me when I was worried that the silicone implants would feel unpleasantly rock hard and artificial under his fingertips? How could I be intimate with a man when I felt anything but beautiful because of my new chest?\n\nI was afraid that a man would take one look at my bare breasts and find any excuse to avoid being intimate with me \u2014 so I remained single and resorted to my vibrator often.\n\nWhether I wanted to sleep with a man or not, the hesitancy and fear of being immediately rejected because of my mastectomy remained stronger than my desire to get laid or date someone. My sex life was certainly thrown a nasty and confusing curveball because of this fear, and I avoided getting into bed with anyone \u2014 unless I had a handful of vodka sodas coursing through me, of course. My liquid courage allowed me to be intimate with the lights on and my bra off. I may have been clumsy, but I was confident.\n\nIf the opportunity for sex presented itself and I was sober, the lights remained off, and my bra stayed on. More importantly, the contempt I had for my new body became impossible to ignore without being buzzed. It was also unrealistic to think that each time I did want to be intimate with a person and not loathe my aesthetic, I would need a drink or two \u2014 unless I towed a flask around in my cleavage or something.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples. There was a time where these two, pink protuberances played the most substantial part in my sex life \u2014 they were the key to my arousal. Now, I feel nothing at all. I knew before having the double mastectomy that I would lose sensation, but no one can prepare you for how heartbreaking this loss will actually be until a man\u2019s tongue is circling your areola and you don\u2019t feel a thing.\n\nMy mastectomy presented me with other sad realities I didn\u2019t have to face until I was in bed with another, like the loss of sensation in my nipples.\n\nI felt broken, and I convinced myself that a man inside me would put me back together again \u2014 that some type of sexual approval would make me confident enough to be with another. Indulging in such an act was proof that I was not falling apart; that I didn\u2019t hate my body; that I was normal and everything was fine.\n\nI\u2019m fine, yet I still fantasized about having sex pre-double mastectomy.\n\nWhen I find myself dejected over the loss of my breasts and every other turmoil that comes along with having the BRCA1 mutation, I remind myself that it could always be worse. For starters, I never had breast cancer. I also have breasts, even if they are fake. Though my nipples may \u201cfeel\u201d nonexistent, they are there \u2014 and they are mine. So many women are not this lucky, and while there are days I could wrap myself in a blanket and my insecurities and sulk in my sadness, I know that I am ultimately a fortunate woman: a woman who deserves to get laid, regardless of my new perky (creepy) breasts.\n\nAfter my double mastectomy, I certainly haven\u2019t finalized a pickup line. I have yet to master the art of dating, and I\u2019m still incredibly awkward when it comes to telling a man about my surgery, but I am not ashamed, either. I took my health into my hands and am the sole decider if I get breast cancer \u2014 and now, I likely never will.\n\nAt the end of the day, my fake breasts are not dealbreakers. I\u2019m vegan, astonishingly loud, and detest country music \u2014 if you want to know my dealbreakers, those are likely them. But if a man were ever to judge me for my rock-hard, gravity defiant, cancer-free breasts? Then he isn\u2019t a man worth a second of my time."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says Facebook Can't Stop All Election Interference", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-zuckerberg-election-interference_us_5c2c6452e4b0407e90861a14", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Wrapping up Facebook\u2019s worst year yet, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted that he has no fix for the hate speech and election interference plaguing his company.\n\nIn a celebratory New Year\u2019s post on the platform last week, the social media giant said his personal goals of 2018 had been focused on \u201cpreventing election interference, stopping the spread of hate speech and misinformation, making sure people have control of their information, and ensuring our services improve people\u2019s well-being,\u201d adding that progress had been made.\n\nRunning through a list of security advances and investments to safeguard the site \u2013 which has fallen under the scrutiny of the federal government as it threatens to regulate it \u2013 Zuckerberg revealed that he didn\u2019t have all the answers.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll catch every bad actor or piece of bad content, or that people won\u2019t find more examples of past mistakes before we improved our systems,\u201d he said in the statement, changing his tone after noting the positives. \u201cFor some of these issues, like election interference or harmful speech, the problems can never fully be solved.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg was attempting to take some of the heat off his business while shedding light on the better parts of his year, but not everyone appreciated the message.\n\n\u201cNothing about selling our data without our consent I see,\u201d one irked user commented. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just too deeply ingrained in Facebook\u2019s \u2018DNA.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother demanded the site \u201cstop playing with users data.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll still make scads of money.\u201d\n\nLast April, Zuckerberg testified before Congress in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the political consulting firm harvested data from millions of users for political and marketing purposes.

The doctors said they were not specifically referring to Memorial Sloan Kettering during the meeting that was recorded by one of those in attendance, but to broader changes in the medical world.\n\nDefining an institution\u2019s role\n\nFounded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering was the first hospital in the country devoted exclusively to treating cancer. Its benefactors have included some of the wealthiest families in America, from the Astors and Rockefellers in its early years to the Kochs today.\n\nIt now operates more than 120 research laboratories, employs more than 1,000 doctors, admits some 23,500 patients a year, operates one of the world\u2019s largest clinical trial programs and had revenues of nearly $4.5 billion in 2017. It recently completed a $3.5 billion fund-raising drive and its charity ball remains a fixture on New York\u2019s social calendar.\n\nAs a leading force in cancer research, the hospital has long grappled with striking a balance in its collaborations with drug companies. While it did business with industry during the tenure of Dr. Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, he and a top deputy, Dr. Robert E.

Frustration with clutter tended to increase with age. Among older adults, clutter problems were also associated with life dissatisfaction.\n\nThe findings add to a growing body of evidence that clutter can negatively impact mental well-being, particularly among women. Clutter can also induce a physiological response, including increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone.\n\nA 2010 study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology looked at dual-income married couples living in the Los Angeles area who had at least one school-aged child at home. The wives in the study who perceived themselves as having a cluttered home or a home that needed work tended to have increased levels of cortisol throughout the day. Those who weren\u2019t feeling cluttered, which included most of the men in the study, had cortisol levels that tended to drop during the day.\n\nDarby Saxbe, an assistant psychology professor at University of Southern California and the study\u2019s lead author, said that the women in the study who described their home as being cluttered or needing work began their day stressed and remained stressed. Some of the added stress, she suspects, was tied to women\u2019s tendency to take on housework and extra chores after the workday. In terms of cortisol levels, men who did more housework in the evening were as likely to have raised cortisol levels at the end of the day as women. It\u2019s just that not as many men spent as much time on housework as their wives, she said."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "The Treatment Gap: In Rehab, \u2018Two Warring Factions\u2019: Abstinence vs. Medication", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit \u2014 an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry\u2019s role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost.\n\nChange started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic.\n\nA few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.\n\nNow he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure\u2019s Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a \u201cmanifesto\u201d outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got these two warring factions \u2014 the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like our national politics. Where\u2019s the John McCain? Here, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nThe medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain\u2019s opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more.\n\nAt Dr. Loyd\u2019s urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/facebook-suicide-screening-algorithm.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2019-01-03 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "A police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.\n\nEarlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case. Facebook called to warn the Police Department about the suicide threat.\n\nThe officer who took the call quickly located the woman, but she denied having suicidal thoughts, the police report said. Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital \u2014 either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook\u2019s intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.)\n\nPolice stations from Massachusetts to Mumbai have received similar alerts from Facebook over the last 18 months as part of what is most likely the world\u2019s largest suicide threat screening and alert program. The social network ramped up the effort after several people live-streamed their suicides on Facebook Live in early 2017. It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats.\n\nFacebook\u2019s rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union \u2014 as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site. Even as Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has apologized for improper harvesting of user data, the company grappled last month with fresh revelations about special data-sharing deals with tech companies."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Phys Ed: Stand More, Lounge Less?

For those of us who overindulged and slacked off on our exercise regimens over the holidays, it also means that being upright is unlikely to help us lose weight.\n\nBut it does not mean we should take this news lying or sitting down, the study\u2019s authors caution, because frequent standing is likely to have other, substantial health impacts.\n\nBy now, almost everyone has heard about, dabbled with or rolled their eyes at the phenomenon of standing desks. Many of us also wear fitness trackers that nag us every hour or so to get up and move."}]
