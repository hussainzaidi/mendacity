In a shortened Christmas Eve session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 600 points after a bizarre attempt by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday to calm investors by consulting with the CEOs of top banks backfired . Losses were compounded by another of Trump's Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve -- following revelations that he has asked if he can legally fire the independent central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nThe Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n\nTrump turns to Twitter while \"all alone\" in the White House\n\nWhile many Americans gathered with their families and with his vacation to the \"Winter White House\" at Mar-a-Lago iced by the shutdown, the President spent the day at the White House blasting critics -- including Democrats who have refused his demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that shuttered the government at midnight on Friday.\n\n\"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\" Trump wrote in what may have been a tongue in cheek tone in his 10th tweet of the day.\n\nTrump was due to be rejoined for Christmas Day by first lady Melania Trump, who had already decamped to Florida before the shutdown took hold.\n\nThe President also lashed out Brett McGurk, his special envoy for eradicating ISIS, who followed Defense Secretary James Mattis by resigning in protest at Trump's hurriedly announced Syria withdrawal. He hit out at \"Little Bob Corker,\" the outgoing Tennessee senator who has criticized him over Syria and the shutdown. He also insisted he did like allies -- but said many took advantage of the US \"both in 'Military Protection and Trade...' \"\n\nA senior administration official told CNN's Jim Sciutto that national security decision-making has \"basically stopped working\" and decisions are \"made on a whim on phone calls.\" The official added the Syria withdrawal was \"a complete reversal\" and it was done \"without deliberation, no consideration of risks.\"\n\nAmerican allies and partners are \"shocked and totally bewildered\" and the Syrian Democratic Forces \"don't believe this is happening,\" the official said.\n\nIt all added up to a feeling of a White House that is hurtling out of control and a President who is becoming increasingly emotional and vexed at a time when he faces mounting legal and political pressure from special counsel Robert Mueller. He is also days away from a new era of punishing Democratic oversight when the new Congress convenes in early January.\n\nThe loss of Mattis -- who was seen around the world as a check on Trump's erratic national security decision-making -- has raised anxiety about his presidency to previously unmatched levels.\n\nOf course, many Trump supporters voted for disruption and to rattle the Washington establishment when they sent him to the White House so are likely to be less concerned than Washington insiders about the febrile Christmas mood.\n\nBut the President's irascible temper is also detracting from his top achievements at the end of the year, including low unemployment and a strong economy despite market turmoil. The passage of a groundbreaking criminal justice bill has also been overshadowed and there is little talk about his most enduring legacy win -- the new majority he and the Senate GOP engineered on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe President seemed to have his loyal base in mind by engineering a shutdown drama that appears to have no easy exits, but allows him to make a political stand cheered on by the conservative media.\n\n\"AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!\" he tweeted at one point on Monday, likely with those voters in mind.\n\n\"Hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm\"\n\nBut the frenetic Christmas Eve spectacle was stunning even by the President's standards, and prompted the two top Democratic leaders, the likely House speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to issue a joint statement.\n\n\"It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve -- after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,\" the statement said.\n\nAs the shutdown lumbered through its third day, with no end in sight, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas arrived to gavel in the chamber for a pro-forma session that only exemplified the lack of action between the White House and Democrats towards a resolution. He resorted to quoting the earthy wisdom of a former Senate majority leader and President to capture the sense of futility and political dislocation.\n\n\"LBJ said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm and just take it. That's about where we are,\" he said.\n\nBut in one sign that the festive spirit can triumph over Washington's humbug, the National Parks Service announced the reopening of the National Christmas Tree, thanks to support from the National Park Foundation -- a group of philanthropic organizations and donors.\n\nThe popular Yuletide tourist spot had been closed after a man tried to climb the tree and damaged it. The government shutdown then prevented the National Park Service from reopening it.\n\nThe shutdown is the third this year and has sent hundreds of thousands of federal employees home for Christmas unsure about their upcoming paychecks.\n\nAt the same time, the stock market is careening south with much of the blame being put on the confusion coming from Washington.\n\nMnunchin has had to reassure investors Trump won't fire Powell and left major bank CEOs \"totally baffled\" with a weekend call asking them about the state of their businesses. More criticism from Trump toward the Fed sent markets reeling Monday, as the Dow closed down 653 points before shutting up shop early for Christmas Eve.\n\nMnuchin's intervention was just the latest development that sparked uncertainty in the days running up to the holiday.\n\nA surprise announcement that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery for cancerous growths on her lung added to the frenetic mood in Washington, as the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Trump by knocking back his new restrictions on asylum seekers who cross the southern border.\n\nAnd more mystery is brewing in the highest court in the land after Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused an order holding an unnamed, foreign-government owned company in contempt over a court case related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nIt all adds up to a Christmas that is feeling less and less merry and bright on Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump tweets 'poor me' as shutdown continues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/mBKiWbHtSSI/trump-christmas-eve-shutdown-tweets-abby-phillip-lead-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Claire McCaskill has some advice for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming freshman who has rapidly risen from obscurity to one of the most well-known figures in the Democratic Party: Talk is cheap.\n\nMcCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who's in her final days in office after losing her bid for a third Senate term, told CNN in a wide-ranging interview that her party must begin to focus and deliver on real issues to attract independent and white working class voters -- not pie-in-the-sky policy ideas, such as tuition-free college, that have little chance of becoming law. Her concern: Voters grow cynical after hearing campaign promises that never go anywhere, empowering forces like President Donald Trump to rail against Washington for failed promises, as he did in 2016.\n\nDemocrats, she suggested, should be cautious about the rise of politicians like the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, who vanquished a Democratic leader, Joe Crowley, in her primary, and have vowed sweeping changes in policy.\n\n\"I don't know her,\" McCaskill said when asked if she'd consider Ocasio-Cortez a \"crazy Democrat\" like the ones she decried on the campaign trail. \"I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good example of what I'm talking about, a bright shiny new object, came out of nowhere and surprised people when she beat a very experienced congressman.\"\n\nMcCaskill added, \"And so she's now talked about a lot. I'm not sure what she's done yet to generate that kind of enthusiasm, but I wish her well. I hope she hangs the moon.\n\n\"But I hope she also realizes that the parts of the country that are rejecting the Democratic Party, like a whole lot of white working class voters, need to hear about how their work is going to be respected, and the dignity of their jobs, and how we can really stick to issues that we can actually accomplish something on.\"\n\nAnd she concluded: \"The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.\"\n\nIn the interview, the blunt-speaking Missouri Democrat, reflecting on her election loss to Republican Josh Hawley -- a political novice whom she also referred to as a \"bright shining object\" -- also didn't mince words for the Republican Party.\n\nWhile she warned that history \"will judge some of my colleagues harshly that they didn't stand up to this President at some of the moments where he has been unhinged about particularly the rule of law,\" she also said that GOP senators have privately conceded they can't speak out against Trump because of backlash they'd receive from their base.\n\n\"Now they'll tell you, if it's just the two of you, 'The guy is nuts, he doesn't have a grasp of the issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter,' \" she said. \"But in public if they go after him ... they know they get a primary, and they know that's tough.\"\n\nShe declined to single out individual Republicans, but when asked about Sen. Lindsey Graham and the South Carolina Republican's alliance with Trump, she said: \"It's kind of weird to me, I don't know what happened with Lindsey.\"\n\n\"This is Donald Trump's Republican Party,\" McCaskill said. \"Make no mistake about it.\"\n\nAs she sat back in her chair in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing room, where she served as the ranking Democrat, she said of Trump, \"I mean, he's almost the master of, 'I'm going to do so much stuff that's crazy that nobody notices crazy anymore.' \"\n\nOne instance, she cited, in particular was when the rapper Kanye West spouted off on a wild, profanity-laced tirade in the Oval Office -- all in front of the television cameras.\n\n\"I mean, Kanye West was in the Oval Office M-F---ing on live TV,\" McCaskill said, seemingly perplexed. \"I mean, think about that. That is crazy weird. Can you imagine would have happened if that happened during the Obama years? ... The lid would have blown off this place.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think Fox News Channel would have gone up in some kind of spontaneous combustion, had that happened (during the Obama years). But it happens under Trump and it's like, well, just another day at the office. So there is a numbing that's gone on, that some of the craziest stuff that he says and does is not as noticeable because there's so much of it.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Trump's brash style and popularity with conservative voters helped turn the tide against McCaskill. He held multiple campaign events for Hawley, railing on McCaskill and castigating her as a far-left liberal out of step with more mainstream voters.\n\n\"He camped out so often in Missouri the last 30 days I figured he was building a golf course,\" McCaskill said.\n\nIn 2006, she eked out a victory against then-Sen. Jim Talent, helping Democrats take control of the Senate -- and in 2012 when then-President Barack Obama lost her state by 10 points, she pulled off a victory due in large part to the controversies of her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded when he downplayed pregnancies caused by rape.\n\nThis time, she faced a 38-year-old, telegenic Republican with little political experience -- something Hawley used to his advantage against the 65-year-old McCaskill, who has nearly four decades in politics.\n\n\"In most professions and careers, the more experience you have, the better, the more valuable you are to the people that you work for. In politics, not so much anymore,\" McCaskill said. \"There was a sense that, maybe she has been around long enough.\"\n\nWhat turned the tide, in McCaskill's view, was the raging fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Trump's 11th-hour rhetoric against migrant caravans approaching the southern border only added to that, and said it amounted to \"whipped cream and the cherry on top of the ice cream\" to drive up GOP turnout.\n\nBut she contended that it was the fight over Kavanaugh, whom she voted against, that ultimately did her in.\n\nAsked if she believed she would have won re-election had there not been a Supreme Court vacancy, she said: \"I think it would have been much more likely.\"\n\nAs one of the country's most vulnerable Senate Democrats, McCaskill had been the subject of a furious onslaught by GOP outside groups -- namely a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about her views on McConnell, she said she believes that \"every decision\" the GOP leader makes is based on whether it helps Republican senators.\n\n\"He is a very, very political leader,\" McCaskill said of McConnell. \"This isn't somebody who is sitting around at night figuring out how he can move the needle on really important policy issues. This is someone who is figuring out how he can win elections and beat Democrats like me.\"\n\nAs her Senate term now comes to an end, McCaskill vowed \"never\" to become a lobbyist but said she will now use her style of \"mouthing off\" in her next line of work. She said she's not waiting to use her mouth now to give advice to her party as candidates line up to take on Trump in 2020.\n\n\"Donald Trump got elected partially because there was such cynicism that we can't get anything done here. And the way you get things done here is by reasonable negotiation and compromise,\" McCaskill said of the 2020 race. \"Somebody who talks about leading in that direction is the one that can win places like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and maybe even compete in a place like Missouri.\"\n\nAsked if her colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is weighing a White House run, could win in those states, McCaskill said, \"I don't know. I think it's hard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Judge orders North Korea to pay Warmbier family $500 million for wrongful death", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/sOouzX_OAjs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A federal judge in Washington awarded the parents of Otto Warmbier more than half a billion dollars in a wrongful death suit against the North Korean government, which detained and allegedly tortured the college student over 17 months before returning him to the US last year, where he died days later.\n\nIn an opinion issued on Christmas Eve, District Judge Beryl A. Howell quoted emotional lines of testimony from Warmbier's mother and recounted grim details of his treatment in North Korea that underpinned the judgment.\n\n\"An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States,\" Howell wrote.\n\nNorth Korean officials detained Warmbier in 2016 as he tried to leave the country after spending five days there on a commercial tour. Warmbier, then a student at the University of Virginia, was accused by the government of stealing a political poster from a restricted floor in his hotel.\n\nWarmbier returned to the United States in June of 2017 after negotiations led by the Trump administration. Then 22 years old, Warmbier was blind and deaf and had sustained severe brain damage from his time in detention. He died less than a week later in his hometown of Cincinnati.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Fred and Cindy Warmbier thanked Howell and called the decision a \"significant step on our journey.\"\n\n\"We are thankful that the United States has a fair and open judicial system so that the world can see that the Kim regime is legally and morally responsible for Otto's death. We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\" they said in the statement.\n\n\"As a family, mother, father, sister and brother, we would like to thank all those who knew and loved Otto, and for all those who supported us and our mission to hold Kim liable for his actions,\" they said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe damages awarded to the Warmbiers included $45 million for pain, suffering and grief, and more than $6 million in economic losses that Otto Warmbier would have earned in life based on his exceptional talent, according to an economist's model.\n\nHowell wrote in her opinion that the Warmbiers had established \"ample evidence\" that the damages requested in their suit, which was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in April, met statutory requirements because they arose from \"North Korea's barbaric mistreatment of Otto, including 'torture,' 'hostage taking,' and 'extrajudicial killing.' \"\n\nA North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that Warmbier had been tortured while in North Korean custody, according to a 2017 report by the country's state-run news agency KCNA.\n\nHowell's ruling does not guarantee an immediate windfall for the Warmbiers, however.\n\nNorth Korea did not respond to the lawsuit -- Howell's opinion was rendered as a so-called \"default judgment\" -- and the country has no free assets in the US that the family could make a claim for.\n\nJUST WATCHED Analyst: North Korea needs to provide detailed list of arsenal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Analyst: North Korea needs to provide detailed list of arsenal 04:18\n\nAny damages eventually won by the Warmbiers would likely come from North Korea's frozen US assets, which amounted to about $63 million in 2017, according to the Treasury Department's Terrorist Assets Report, and those potential payments would be limited to the compensatory damages in Howell's opinion -- a narrow portion of their larger award.\n\nRequests for comment sent to North Korean officials in New York were not answered.\n\nSteven Perles, an attorney who has won billion-dollar Foreign Soverign Immunities Act judgments for victims of terror attacks, said these cases are brought not for the money, but for the \"deterrent value.\"\n\n\"It's not about enriching the Warmbiers here. Nothing can bring their son back, nothing can compensate them,\" Perles said. \"But if they can really take money away from the North Koreans, maybe the North Koreans or some other would-be bad actor would think twice before doing this to somebody else. That's the only reason you do this.\"\n\nA few hours after Howell's opinion was published, President Donald Trump said Monday afternoon that he had been briefed by his team working on North Korea and he was looking forward to a second summit with Kim. He made no mention of the judgment.\n\n\"Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea -- Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!\" Trump said on Twitter."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Indonesians worry another tsunami is coming, as 5,600 are displaced and hundreds are dead or injured", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/06RXZUgyyOc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the threat of more deadly tsunamis casts a pall over Indonesia, the country's National Disaster Mitigation Agency said Tuesday that more than 16,000 people are displaced.\n\nThat's in addition to more than 420 confirmed dead, 1,485 injured and 154 still missing.\n\nEven if no more disasters like Saturday's tsunami strike the Java and Sumatra coasts, those numbers could still rise as authorities work to gauge the true scope of the disaster.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Indonesia expects the death toll to rise, spokeswoman Kathy Mueller said, explaining that the nonprofit is providing residents with basic household items, clean water and equipment to clear debris.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Japan suffers biggest natural population decline ever", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/uULpMop0SBk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Japan suffered its biggest natural population decline ever this year, government statistics show.\n\nThe fast-graying nation also posted a record-low birthrate, as the estimated number of babies born in 2018 dipped to 921,000 -- the lowest since records began in 1899 -- according to a report published Friday by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nThe number of newborns is estimated to have shrunk by 25,000 from 2017, and the figure remains under the 1 million mark for the third year running.\n\nDeaths in 2018 also hit a postwar record high of 1.369 million, with a natural population decline of 448,000 -- the highest ever.\n\nbut Japan is a \"super-aged\" nation, meaning more than 20% of its population is older than 65.

My family did too, in a city called Kharkov in Soviet Ukraine. My mother was a doctor; my father an engineer. We had cousins, friends, favorite restaurants. We lived in an apartment block with lilac trees in the yard. We lived under an anti-Semitic dictatorship, but it was still a life.\n\nIn 1989, when I was 9 years old, communism began to collapse. Anti-Semitism surged to a point where it was no longer safe for me to go to school. There was unrest in the Baltics and the Caucasus.

In a shortened Christmas Eve session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 600 points after a bizarre attempt by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday to calm investors by consulting with the CEOs of top banks backfired . Losses were compounded by another of Trump's Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve -- following revelations that he has asked if he can legally fire the independent central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nThe Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n\nTrump turns to Twitter while \"all alone\" in the White House\n\nWhile many Americans gathered with their families and with his vacation to the \"Winter White House\" at Mar-a-Lago iced by the shutdown, the President spent the day at the White House blasting critics -- including Democrats who have refused his demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that shuttered the government at midnight on Friday.\n\n\"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\" Trump wrote in what may have been a tongue in cheek tone in his 10th tweet of the day.\n\nTrump was due to be rejoined for Christmas Day by first lady Melania Trump, who had already decamped to Florida before the shutdown took hold.\n\nThe President also lashed out Brett McGurk, his special envoy for eradicating ISIS, who followed Defense Secretary James Mattis by resigning in protest at Trump's hurriedly announced Syria withdrawal. He hit out at \"Little Bob Corker,\" the outgoing Tennessee senator who has criticized him over Syria and the shutdown. He also insisted he did like allies -- but said many took advantage of the US \"both in 'Military Protection and Trade...' \"\n\nA senior administration official told CNN's Jim Sciutto that national security decision-making has \"basically stopped working\" and decisions are \"made on a whim on phone calls.\" The official added the Syria withdrawal was \"a complete reversal\" and it was done \"without deliberation, no consideration of risks.\"\n\nAmerican allies and partners are \"shocked and totally bewildered\" and the Syrian Democratic Forces \"don't believe this is happening,\" the official said.\n\nIt all added up to a feeling of a White House that is hurtling out of control and a President who is becoming increasingly emotional and vexed at a time when he faces mounting legal and political pressure from special counsel Robert Mueller. He is also days away from a new era of punishing Democratic oversight when the new Congress convenes in early January.\n\nThe loss of Mattis -- who was seen around the world as a check on Trump's erratic national security decision-making -- has raised anxiety about his presidency to previously unmatched levels.\n\nOf course, many Trump supporters voted for disruption and to rattle the Washington establishment when they sent him to the White House so are likely to be less concerned than Washington insiders about the febrile Christmas mood.\n\nBut the President's irascible temper is also detracting from his top achievements at the end of the year, including low unemployment and a strong economy despite market turmoil. The passage of a groundbreaking criminal justice bill has also been overshadowed and there is little talk about his most enduring legacy win -- the new majority he and the Senate GOP engineered on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe President seemed to have his loyal base in mind by engineering a shutdown drama that appears to have no easy exits, but allows him to make a political stand cheered on by the conservative media.\n\n\"AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!\" he tweeted at one point on Monday, likely with those voters in mind.\n\n\"Hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm\"\n\nBut the frenetic Christmas Eve spectacle was stunning even by the President's standards, and prompted the two top Democratic leaders, the likely House speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to issue a joint statement.\n\n\"It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve -- after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,\" the statement said.\n\nAs the shutdown lumbered through its third day, with no end in sight, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas arrived to gavel in the chamber for a pro-forma session that only exemplified the lack of action between the White House and Democrats towards a resolution. He resorted to quoting the earthy wisdom of a former Senate majority leader and President to capture the sense of futility and political dislocation.\n\n\"LBJ said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm and just take it. That's about where we are,\" he said.\n\nBut in one sign that the festive spirit can triumph over Washington's humbug, the National Parks Service announced the reopening of the National Christmas Tree, thanks to support from the National Park Foundation -- a group of philanthropic organizations and donors.\n\nThe popular Yuletide tourist spot had been closed after a man tried to climb the tree and damaged it. The government shutdown then prevented the National Park Service from reopening it.\n\nThe shutdown is the third this year and has sent hundreds of thousands of federal employees home for Christmas unsure about their upcoming paychecks.\n\nAt the same time, the stock market is careening south with much of the blame being put on the confusion coming from Washington.\n\nMnunchin has had to reassure investors Trump won't fire Powell and left major bank CEOs \"totally baffled\" with a weekend call asking them about the state of their businesses.

The markets closed a truncated Christmas Eve trading day sharply down, with the Dow dropping 653 points and the S&P 500 nearing a bear market. A midday tweet from the President attacking the Fed compounded the slide.\n\nThe series of events amplified the anxiety emanating from the White House over shaky markets -- and the effect they could have on Trump's political standing.\n\nAn unusual statement issued by the Treasury Department on Sunday declaring major bank CEOs told Mnuchin by phone they had \"ample liquidity\" to lend only furthered the notion the administration is working to tamp down a crisis that doesn't yet exist -- and in the process is raising concerns that are shaking markets further. Liquidity is the term used to refer to the ability of banks to lend money to clients.\n\nThe CEOs who spoke individually by phone Sunday with Mnuchin were \"totally baffled\" by the sessions, according to a person familiar with the calls, who said the executives found the encounters puzzling and largely unnecessary.\n\n\"It was totally out of left field and an odd thing to do,\" the person said, describing the timing of the calls -- on a Sunday ahead of Christmas before markets opened -- as strange.\n\nCEO says political noise causing market concerns\n\nAfter Mnuchin asked on his calls whether their banks were seeing any liquidity issues, the executives all replied they were not.\n\nLater, the treasury secretary asked whether there were any other issues going on that the executives might see as affecting the markets, according to the person. Another person familiar with the matter said the secretary took the initiative to reach out to the CEOs.\n\nOne of the CEOs responded by saying political noise from Washington -- including trade fears, the departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis and the government shutdown -- were among the drivers causing concern in the markets.\n\nMnuchin was in \"listening mode,\" the person said, and the calls were not described as contentious.\n\nAfterward, there was a belief among some executives that Mnuchin was attempting to assert himself, to show he was in charge, and to soothe markets all during a vacation in Mexico that was garnering criticism because it came in the middle of a government shutdown (Mnuchin traveled on a commercial plane and was spending time with his children).\n\nMnuchin calling CEOs and issuing the statement was a \"pre-emptive measure\" after last week's market volatility, according to a Treasury official. \"This was meant to be a reassuring step and it was consistent with what the Secretary thought bankers would say,\" the official said.\n\nBut some of the bank executives and analysts were taken aback by the public nature of the Treasury statement reading out the calls -- which placed the liquidity matter front and center, when in fact there is no real crisis at hand.\n\n\"This is the type of announcement that raises the question of whether Treasury sees problems that the rest of the market is missing,\" Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients. \"Not only did he consult with the biggest banks, but he is talking to all of the financial regulators on Christmas Eve. We do not see this type of announcement as constructive and worry that it can trigger the vary panic that Treasury wants to avoid.\"\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who's the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, called Mnuchin's actions \"erratic\" in a statement released late Monday.\n\n\"The financial markets need certainty, and a Federal Reserve that can independently set monetary policy,\" Waters' statement said. \"The recent actions of the President and the Treasury Secretary, however, have been erratic and are creating uncertainty and instability in the markets. It would be in our nation's best interest if they stopped what they are doing.\"\n\nMnuchin convened a roughly 15-minute call on Monday with the President's Working Group on financial markets, which includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve and top market and business regulators, to ensure all the agencies were well-coordinated to monitor markets appropriately during the government shutdown, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe secretary's calls Sunday to the big bank CEOs came after a turbulent week on Wall Street and were described as a \"prudent check-in\" with major market participants of how they thought the economy was performing.\n\nSeiberg noted it's normal for the treasury secretary to talk to the biggest banks after a week of stock market turmoil, but he views the calls to bank CEOs and convening the call with regulators as a sign that the market needs reassuring about liquidity, margin and clearing.\n\n\"It raises the question of why Treasury needs to reassure if everything is okay,\" Seiberg wrote.\n\nTrump's frustration ratchets up\n\nTrump has directed much of his frustrations over the markets on his treasury secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Trump has vented that Mnuchin's recommendation of Jerome Powell for the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve was a fateful mistake. Trump has told some advisers that he views selecting Powell the worst decision of his entire presidency.\n\nBut beyond that, Trump has complained more broadly that Mnuchin isn't doing enough to stabilize markets, the person said, viewing recent plunges as a sign his team hasn't assured investors of the economy's strength. Trump was particularly frustrated that a tentative trade deal with China on tariffs did not provide a boost in the markets -- something Mnuchin and other advisers said would happen if an agreement was struck.\n\nThe central object of Trump's frustration remains Powell, who last week announced another hike in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The move, widely expected, caused markets to tumble. Trump is not alone in his criticism of the rate hikes; many economists say there is little economic reason to keep increasing rates.\n\nYet Trump has taken outsized umbrage at the moves, deeming them designed to damage him politically. He's taken to scrutinizing Wall Street fluctuations as a barometer of his political standing, and has asked his advisers whether dips in the market will harm his re-election prospects.\n\n\"The only problem our economy has is the Fed,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Monday. He was spending the day at the White House after the government shutdown prevented him from traveling to his resort in Florida. \"They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!\"\n\nHis frustrations have risen so high that Trump has asked his team whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell -- a move that Mnuchin, among others, has worked hurriedly to prevent. Mnuchin has been working for the past several days to convince Trump that he cannot fire his Fed chairman -- both from a legal standpoint and to avoid further market turmoil.\n\nSpeaking on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday, incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump \"now realizes he does not have the authority\" to fire Powell -- a suggestion the issue had recently been raised.\n\nTrump, however, still believes Powell is to blame for the instability and wants to ensure he's getting the message. He's raised the possibility of sending an envoy to meet with Powell directly, according to the person familiar. And while Mnuchin has encouraged Trump that any moves toward firing or downgrading Powell would be catastrophic, some other White House advisers have taken a less grave view, which has given Trump an opening to discuss it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Judge orders North Korea to pay Warmbier family $500 million for wrongful death", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/sOouzX_OAjs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A federal judge in Washington awarded the parents of Otto Warmbier more than half a billion dollars in a wrongful death suit against the North Korean government, which detained and allegedly tortured the college student over 17 months before returning him to the US last year, where he died days later.\n\nIn an opinion issued on Christmas Eve, District Judge Beryl A. Howell quoted emotional lines of testimony from Warmbier's mother and recounted grim details of his treatment in North Korea that underpinned the judgment.\n\n\"An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States,\" Howell wrote.\n\nNorth Korean officials detained Warmbier in 2016 as he tried to leave the country after spending five days there on a commercial tour. Warmbier, then a student at the University of Virginia, was accused by the government of stealing a political poster from a restricted floor in his hotel.\n\nWarmbier returned to the United States in June of 2017 after negotiations led by the Trump administration. Then 22 years old, Warmbier was blind and deaf and had sustained severe brain damage from his time in detention. He died less than a week later in his hometown of Cincinnati.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Fred and Cindy Warmbier thanked Howell and called the decision a \"significant step on our journey.\"\n\n\"We are thankful that the United States has a fair and open judicial system so that the world can see that the Kim regime is legally and morally responsible for Otto's death. We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\" they said in the statement.\n\n\"As a family, mother, father, sister and brother, we would like to thank all those who knew and loved Otto, and for all those who supported us and our mission to hold Kim liable for his actions,\" they said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe damages awarded to the Warmbiers included $45 million for pain, suffering and grief, and more than $6 million in economic losses that Otto Warmbier would have earned in life based on his exceptional talent, according to an economist's model.\n\nHowell wrote in her opinion that the Warmbiers had established \"ample evidence\" that the damages requested in their suit, which was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in April, met statutory requirements because they arose from \"North Korea's barbaric mistreatment of Otto, including 'torture,' 'hostage taking,' and 'extrajudicial killing.' \"\n\nA North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that Warmbier had been tortured while in North Korean custody, according to a 2017 report by the country's state-run news agency KCNA.\n\nHowell's ruling does not guarantee an immediate windfall for the Warmbiers, however.\n\nNorth Korea did not respond to the lawsuit -- Howell's opinion was rendered as a so-called \"default judgment\" -- and the country has no free assets in the US that the family could make a claim for.\n\nJUST WATCHED Analyst: North Korea needs to provide detailed list of arsenal Replay More Videos ...

James Mattis' resignation triggered an outpouring of anxiety and anger and a steady stream of kudos for the 68-year-old, but as the shock of his departure begins to ebb, another narrative about the \"warrior monk\" is emerging.\n\nEven as Mattis is being hailed as a \"national treasure\" and praised for his moral compass and \"sound judgment,\" conversations with multiple US defense officials reflect a frustration with the outgoing defense secretary.\n\nWhile some of these frustrations are being overshadowed by President Donald Trump's decision to push Mattis out of his post on January 1, two months earlier than originally planned, these sources suggest that the general's tendency to exert tight control may have contributed to the crisis surrounding Trump's precipitous decision Wednesday to end the US military presence in Syria and scale it back in Afghanistan.\n\nMattis resigned in disagreement over Trump's Syria decision, which will likely empower Russia and Iran and leave Syrian Kurds -- staunch US allies -- at risk from both ISIS and Turkey. The Associated Press, citing US and Turkish officials, first reported that the President agreed to the withdrawal in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week without consulting his national security team or US allies.\n\nAt odds for months\n\nMattis' resignation capped an extended period of tension with the President, though fundamental differences have long existed. Mattis is a 68-year-old who has devoted his life to the military. Trump, meanwhile, is a 72-year-old who is drawn to heroic military figures but repeatedly sidestepped the draft as a young man and has yet to make the customary presidential visit to troops in overseas combat zones.\n\nSeveral administration officials tell CNN they believe that if, in fact, Mattis and Trump had been at odds for months, the secretary had an obligation to leave far earlier than he did. He waited too long to act and now, they say, the Kurds will pay the price.\n\nThese officials argue that if Mattis had left after Trump dismissively referred to him in an October interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" as \"sort of a Democrat,\" there could have been another defense secretary in place who might have been able to talk the President out of the troop drawdown.\n\n\"Writing a formal letter and presenting it to the boss personally was exactly the right thing to do. It is very much in keeping with military custom.,\" said John Kirby, CNN's military and diplomatic affairs analyst and a retired rear admiral. But, he added, \"Having that letter be so long and philosophical, reading almost as a manifesto of sorts, and then aggressively pushing it out to media outlets shortly after delivery came across as little more than a shot at redemption and a chance to get ahead of Trump's spin.\"\n\nBut Mattis is the same person he has always been, the officials said, none of whom are Trump supporters. They portray the secretary as driven by his own views and determination to stay on the job while trying to keep from angering Trump, and they add that the very public orchestration of his departure is not going down well in some military circles.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n\nA US defense official said Trump has pushed a bold agenda, which Mattis helped shape. He convinced Trump to launch a new Afghanistan and South Asia strategy calling for increased troop levels and more military autonomy, helped bring together a coalition to defeat ISIS, and was the first in the administration to call for increased defense spending by NATO members, the official said.\n\n\"The President was the only one elected and must execute his agenda. To do that, he needs people who share his point of view. When the secretary determined he was no longer well aligned with the President, he rendered his resignation,\" according to a US defense official. \"There is a long list of former and current administration officials, lawmakers and others who try and have tried to convince the President to make different decisions, but President Trump is his own man. And so is Jim Mattis.\"\n\nThe Defense Department has posted Mattis' resignation letter on Facebook and on its website. Some see this as a disrespectful dig at the President. And multiple defense officials are eagerly backgrounding reporters, saying more officials will also resign although no Defense Department personnel have so far done so.\n\nIndeed, a military official who regularly talks to Mattis called his letter \"a dog whistle\" to anyone in uniform but particularly for the general officer corps, which should consider it a signal to resign if they also have issues with Trump's policies.\n\nWhile there's no sign at this point of any officer resignations, Brett McGurk -- the American envoy to the coalition to fight ISIS -- also resigned on Friday over Trump's decision to pull US forces out of Syria.\n\nOne defense official pointed to an essential part of Mattis' departure, saying the secretary's exit might be a relief for some.\n\nMattis restricted access to information and put a chill on members of the military services talking publicly. Some might be relieved to see him go if they are now freer to push publicly for their agendas, the official said.\n\nMattis also discouraged senior officers from interacting directly with the President, worried that Trump might suddenly issue them orders -- senior officers would have had no option but to do as Trump wished, according to a defense official.\n\nRunning out of steam\n\nSenior battlefield commanders who have had a chance to meet with the President have been dismayed that he had no questions for them and showed a lack of interest, CNN can confirm.\n\nMattis' own strategy for dealing with Trump eventually ran out of runway. He avoided speaking publicly for fear of getting crosswise with Trump or being seen in contradiction. He also tried delaying tactics on issues such as the Syria withdrawal, which had been on the table all year.\n\nFollowing Mattis' tenure, officials speculate that Trump is unlikely to turn to another retired general to become the next secretary of defense.\n\nTwo names that been thrown about to be the next defense secretary are Mark Esper, the Army secretary, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has already been appointed as acting secretary.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they fare any better than Mattis."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "McCaskill warns Dems about 'cheap' rhetoric; says GOP senators privately believe Trump is 'nuts'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/gfn_nW3uldw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sen.

Her concern: Voters grow cynical after hearing campaign promises that never go anywhere, empowering forces like President Donald Trump to rail against Washington for failed promises, as he did in 2016.\n\nDemocrats, she suggested, should be cautious about the rise of politicians like the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, who vanquished a Democratic leader, Joe Crowley, in her primary, and have vowed sweeping changes in policy.\n\n\"I don't know her,\" McCaskill said when asked if she'd consider Ocasio-Cortez a \"crazy Democrat\" like the ones she decried on the campaign trail. \"I'm a little confused why she's the thing.

I hope she hangs the moon.\n\n\"But I hope she also realizes that the parts of the country that are rejecting the Democratic Party, like a whole lot of white working class voters, need to hear about how their work is going to be respected, and the dignity of their jobs, and how we can really stick to issues that we can actually accomplish something on.\"\n\nAnd she concluded: \"The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.\"\n\nIn the interview, the blunt-speaking Missouri Democrat, reflecting on her election loss to Republican Josh Hawley -- a political novice whom she also referred to as a \"bright shining object\" -- also didn't mince words for the Republican Party.\n\nWhile she warned that history \"will judge some of my colleagues harshly that they didn't stand up to this President at some of the moments where he has been unhinged about particularly the rule of law,\" she also said that GOP senators have privately conceded they can't speak out against Trump because of backlash they'd receive from their base.\n\n\"Now they'll tell you, if it's just the two of you, 'The guy is nuts, he doesn't have a grasp of the issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter,' \" she said. \"But in public if they go after him ... they know they get a primary, and they know that's tough.\"\n\nShe declined to single out individual Republicans, but when asked about Sen.

That is crazy weird. Can you imagine would have happened if that happened during the Obama years? ... The lid would have blown off this place.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think Fox News Channel would have gone up in some kind of spontaneous combustion, had that happened (during the Obama years). But it happens under Trump and it's like, well, just another day at the office. So there is a numbing that's gone on, that some of the craziest stuff that he says and does is not as noticeable because there's so much of it.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Trump's brash style and popularity with conservative voters helped turn the tide against McCaskill. He held multiple campaign events for Hawley, railing on McCaskill and castigating her as a far-left liberal out of step with more mainstream voters.\n\n\"He camped out so often in Missouri the last 30 days I figured he was building a golf course,\" McCaskill said.\n\nIn 2006, she eked out a victory against then-Sen. Jim Talent, helping Democrats take control of the Senate -- and in 2012 when then-President Barack Obama lost her state by 10 points, she pulled off a victory due in large part to the controversies of her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded when he downplayed pregnancies caused by rape.\n\nThis time, she faced a 38-year-old, telegenic Republican with little political experience -- something Hawley used to his advantage against the 65-year-old McCaskill, who has nearly four decades in politics.\n\n\"In most professions and careers, the more experience you have, the better, the more valuable you are to the people that you work for. In politics, not so much anymore,\" McCaskill said. \"There was a sense that, maybe she has been around long enough.\"\n\nWhat turned the tide, in McCaskill's view, was the raging fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Trump's 11th-hour rhetoric against migrant caravans approaching the southern border only added to that, and said it amounted to \"whipped cream and the cherry on top of the ice cream\" to drive up GOP turnout.\n\nBut she contended that it was the fight over Kavanaugh, whom she voted against, that ultimately did her in.\n\nAsked if she believed she would have won re-election had there not been a Supreme Court vacancy, she said: \"I think it would have been much more likely.\"\n\nAs one of the country's most vulnerable Senate Democrats, McCaskill had been the subject of a furious onslaught by GOP outside groups -- namely a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about her views on McConnell, she said she believes that \"every decision\" the GOP leader makes is based on whether it helps Republican senators.\n\n\"He is a very, very political leader,\" McCaskill said of McConnell. \"This isn't somebody who is sitting around at night figuring out how he can move the needle on really important policy issues. This is someone who is figuring out how he can win elections and beat Democrats like me.\"\n\nAs her Senate term now comes to an end, McCaskill vowed \"never\" to become a lobbyist but said she will now use her style of \"mouthing off\" in her next line of work. She said she's not waiting to use her mouth now to give advice to her party as candidates line up to take on Trump in 2020.\n\n\"Donald Trump got elected partially because there was such cynicism that we can't get anything done here. And the way you get things done here is by reasonable negotiation and compromise,\" McCaskill said of the 2020 race. \"Somebody who talks about leading in that direction is the one that can win places like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and maybe even compete in a place like Missouri.\"\n\nAsked if her colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is weighing a White House run, could win in those states, McCaskill said, \"I don't know. I think it's hard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Japan suffers biggest population decline ever in 2018", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/uULpMop0SBk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Japan suffered its biggest natural population decline ever this year, government statistics show.\n\nThe fast-graying nation also posted a record-low birthrate, as the estimated number of babies born in 2018 dipped to 921,000 -- the lowest since records began in 1899 -- according to a report published Friday by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n\nThe number of newborns is estimated to have shrunk by 25,000 from 2017, and the figure remains under the 1 million mark for the third year running.\n\nDeaths in 2018 also hit a postwar record high of 1.369 million, with a natural population decline of 448,000 -- the highest ever.\n\nbut Japan is a \"super-aged\" nation, meaning more than 20% of its population is older than 65.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad. It's very bad.\"\n\nBailey's story\n\nBailey was a healthy little girl until October 28, 2014, when she suddenly couldn't move her neck or her right shoulder or leg.\n\nA rehabilitation expert at a children's hospital said Bailey wasn't really paralyzed, according to her mother, Mikell Sheehan.\n\nThe doctor said the paralysis was an emotional reaction to her sister's birth four months earlier. He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "More than 164,000 pounds of ground turkey recalled; 52 more people sick in deadly salmonella outbreak", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/iUvEUWRYf6A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales Inc. is recalling about 164,210 pounds of raw ground turkey products due to the possibility of salmonella contamination, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Friday .\n\nThe recall was announced as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 52 new cases of illness associated with the outbreak.

The illnesses occurred between April 2017 and this November, but nearly half of the illnesses began in October and last month. Five patients have been hospitalized, and one person died.\n\n\"Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to raw turkey and raw chicken products has been identified as the likely source of the outbreak,\" a public health notice from the agency said. \"Many of the individuals who became sick reported eating different types of turkey and chicken products before their illnesses occurred.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, the cases in Canada have the same strain of salmonella as those in the US outbreak.\n\nHealth investigators have identified the outbreak strain of salmonella in samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys, the CDC said.\n\nThe recalled raw ground turkey products were produced at Jennie-O's Faribault, Minnesota, facility between October 22 and October 23. The recalled packages are marked on the side with establishment number P-579 and were sold in 1-pound, 2.5-pound and 3-pound packages.\n\nOn November 15 , the company issued a recall of more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products from its Barron, Wisconsin, facility.\n\nPatients who were interviewed by outbreak investigators reported buying a variety of different brands of raw turkey products from many different stores. \"A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified that could account for the whole outbreak,\" the CDC said.

He called it a much wider problem across the industry, even without the ongoing outbreak. \"We know the issue of salmonella isn't specific to us,\" he said.\n\nState health officials in Arizona and Michigan identified salmonella bacteria in unopened packages of Jennie-O ground turkey from the homes of two patients with salmonella illness. This bacteria was \"closely related genetically\" to the bacteria from the patients. \"This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating turkey,\" the CDC said.\n\nLykken said, \"As always, turkey remains safe to consume when handled and prepared properly. Jennie-O has information available on its website with step-by-step instructions on how to safely prepare and enjoy turkey.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers should not eat any recalled products and should take steps to prevent salmonella illness. That includes washing hands and thoroughly cooking turkey to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as measured by a food thermometer.

This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

while it is still in the womb.\n\nIt can improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida.\n\nThe procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London.\n\nIn the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure.\n\nIt is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk.\n\nKate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).\n\nMore than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.\n\nLouise Fish, chief executive of the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: \"We're delighted that NHS England has decided to fund this life-changing and potential life-saving treatment from April 2019 onwards.\n\n\"We'll be working with TSC clinics across

Every variety of chestnut is affected.\"\n\nOver the last three years since the infestation first arrived in the area, countless trees have died. Over the generations each plot of land, or finca, has been divided between offspring with the chestnut proving the most lucrative of all the crops.\n\nAlthough cork and other trees grow in abundance, most farmers depend on chestnuts that are exported to France for specialist processing.\n\nIn order to limit the damage, some farmers are burning the infected trees to protect those who aren't affected. \"This is increasing the risk of forest fires,\" says Antonio Pulido.\n\n\"It is also adding to urban drift as young people in the villages see their future disappearing in front of their eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Here, sweet chestnuts are prepared at a local restaurant.

He collected a specimen and sent it to Kew, where it was identified as a new species. The plant, Lebbiea Grandiflora, has been named after him.\n\nImage copyright RBG Kew Image caption An aquatic herb found in a waterfall in the Sewa River\n\n\"It's got unique characteristics, that are unlike any other plant in that particular family and that straight away indicated to me that we had come across something very unique,\" he told BBC News. \"My name will forever be linked to it.\"\n\nThe plant has been classed as critically endangered. Found in an area that is under threat from mining and a hydro-electric project, the scientists believe it may be extinct within a few years.\n\nIt is thought that fish feed on the plants, strengthening the health of the ecosystem.\n\n\"Every single species of plant on earth is also important for our survival,\" said Prof Lebbie, of the National Herbarium of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"If we say we are not going to be custodians or guardians of it and allow them to disappear, for me that is something the world has lost, and as of now we don't even know the value of it.\"\n\nBug-eater from a remote island\n\nThere are more than 150 species of pitcher plant in the world.

Pitcher plants, known as Nepenthes, have a number of potential uses in medicine, which have yet to be fully explored.\n\nThey are finding new things in plants all the time, Lara Jewitt, nurseries manager at Kew, said. \"We never know what we are going to discover within these plants.\"\n\nFlower that could be a future cancer medicine\n\nThe new plant, named Kindia gangan, is a member of the coffee family.

Another 10 people were wounded in the attack.\n\nThe attack began in the afternoon when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car outside the public works ministry. Gunmen then stormed the building of the National Authority for Disabled People and Martyrs' Families, taking civilians hostage as they fought a gun battle against Afghan soldiers.\n\nAfghan security forces went from floor to floor of the building in an operation to rescue over 350 people inside, but had to exercise restraint in their operations against the attackers given the number of employees there, a senior security official said.\n\n''There was a frightening sound from the explosion,\" Hassib Ulah, a local shopkeeper, said. \"We got scared and escaped.

drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

She awarded punitive damages and payments covering medical expenses, economic loss and pain and suffering to Fred and Cindy Warmbier, who alleged that their son had been held hostage and tortured.\n\nWarmbier was a University of Virginia student who was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody.\n\nIn holding the North Korean government liable, Howell accused the government of seizing Warmbier for \u201cuse as a pawn in that totalitarian state\u2019s global shenanigans and face-off with the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with \u2018big dreams\u2019 and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cHe was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to U.S. government officials for his final trip home.\u201d\n\nThe arrest and death of Warmbier came during a time of heightened tension between the U.S. and North Korea over the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.\n\nThe judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there\u2019s no practical mechanism to force it do so. But the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.\n\nFred and Cindy Warmbier, who are from a suburb of Cincinnati, said they were thankful the court found the government of Kim Jong Un \u201clegally and morally\u201d responsible for their son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody.\n\nWhen his parents boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the U.S., they were \u201cstunned to see his condition,\u201d court documents say.\n\nThe 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family\u2019s attempts to comfort him. His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scarred on his foot. An expert said in court papers that the injuries suggested he had been tortured with electric shock.\n\nA neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.\n\nNorth Korea has denied that Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism in custody, though medical experts said there was no evidence of that.\n\nThe complaint also said Warmbier was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a short trial. He was denied communication with his family. In June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.\n\nThough foreign nations are generally immune from being sued in U.S. courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed the case to move forward and for her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are U.S. citizens and that North Koreans\u2019 conduct amounts to torture and hostage taking.\n\nThe penalty awarded by Howell to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier\u2019s estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers\u2019 behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former U.S. attorney. He told The Associated Press that while \u201cnothing will ever bring Otto back to the Warmbiers or erase their memories of his horrid last 18 months,\u201d the judge\u2019s order was \u201cvery good news for his family and friends.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Actor Kevin Spacey to Face Charge in Sexual Assault of Teen", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/actor-kevin-spacey-to-face-charge-in-sexual-assault-of-teen/4714894.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. actor Kevin Spacey is facing a felony charge for allegedly sexually assaulting the teenage at a Nantucket, Massachusetts, restaurant more than two years ago.\n\n\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor is set to be arraigned on a charge of indecent assault and battery on January 7.\n\n\n\nIn November last year, Boston-based news anchor Heather Unruh held a news conference to share her son's allegation of sexual assault against Spacey.\n\n\n\nShe said her then-18-year-old son was was sexually assaulted by Spacey in a late-night encounter at the Club Car restaurant and bar in Nantucket on July 7, 2016.

The feature \"On the Basis of Sex\", by Mimi Leder, another female filmmaker, offers a dramatized portrayal of the beginnings of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s illustrious career and her fight for women\u2019s rights, through the lens of her personal life.\n\nLeder's film follows Justice Ginsburg\u2019s challenges in a man\u2019s world, starting with her first year as a Harvard law student in 1954. She was one of nine female students among more than 500 men, a situation that did not please the school's dean, played by Sam Waterston. The film shows the character demanding to know why they are occupying seats that could otherwise have gone to young men.\n\n\n\n\"On the Basis of Sex\" also looks into Ginsburg\u2019s life as a wife and mother. At some point she was supporting her convalescent husband, who had suffered testicular cancer, by attending both her classes and his.\n\nDaniel Stiepleman, the film\u2019s screenwriter, is Justice Ginsburg\u2019s nephew. He told VOA that apart from her legal acumen and advocacy for women\u2019s rights, he wanted to share his first-hand experience of Ginsburg\u2019s equal partnership with her husband, renowned tax law attorney Martin Ginsburg.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have always looked up to Aunt Ruth and Uncle Marty as our role models for what a marriage is supposed to be like,\" he explained. \"They shared the load raising their kids, getting food on the table, and taking care of the house, and we knew that that\u2019s how we wanted to be as well. And so, for me, this was an opportunity to share our good fortune to have them as role models with the rest of the country, the rest of the world.\"\n\nActor Armie Hammer interprets Martin Ginsburg. Hammer says he felt privileged to learn about the man's character from Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself. \"We were very lucky to have time with Justice Ginsburg in her private chambers in the Supreme Court. She invited us in and she was very generous with her time. More than actually answering any of my questions, I learned everything I needed to know about the relationship, [because] the minute his name came up she started smiling. And I could feel that love was very much alive.\u201d\n\nHammer predicts the film will inspire audiences, especially women during the #MeToo era. \"I think it is great for women to see a movie about a woman who changed the world without needing superpowers.\u201d\n\nGinsburg herself is portrayed by Felicity Jones. It was a role she found, to say the least, challenging. She told VOA, \u201cIt was nerve wracking! You don\u2019t enter into that lightly so it was about becoming her in every single way and doing justice to her story.\u201d She also says that though the events surrounding Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life have been dramatized for the sake of entertainment, they speak truth to power. \"It is so important that it does entertain but at the same time, it\u2019s about getting a message into this world and about saying,\u2018Look what men and women can achieve when they work together, when they have absolute equality.'\"\n\nRBG chronicles Justice Ginsburg\u2019s life from her birth to an immigrant Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, to her rise as a pop culture icon known as \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d Since 2013, when the majority of the Supreme Court justices were conservative, Justice Ginsburg became the most vocal dissenting liberal voice on the court. At that time, New York University law student Shana Knizhnik created a blog about Ginsburg's fiery dissenting opinions against decisions by the majority conservative justices. She coined the term, \u201cNotorious R.B.G.,\u201d echoing the moniker of a well-known rapper \u2014 also from Brooklyn \u2014 The Notorious B.I.G.\n\n\n\nKnizhnik's blog and follow-up best-selling book re-introduced the octogenarian\u2019s pivotal role in the fight for gender equality and women\u2019s rights for more than half a century, and established her as the bulwark of liberalism in the high court. Every time Knizhnik would write about another of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissenting opinions, \u201cthe web would explode,\u201d comments a young woman in the documentary.\n\nMedia strategist Frank Chi created an online graphic of the justice in her Supreme Court robe and white collar and a crown like the one worn by The Notorious B.I.G. The image caught on: tattoos, t-shirts and mugs would carry his design, and images created by others. Chocolatier Sue Cassidy says her company, Choukette, includes a portrait of Ginsburg on chocolate, as part of its Phenomenal Women line. \"She has her own box, and we can\u2019t keep them in stock. They are just selling like crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am 84 years old and everybody wants to take a picture with me,\u201d says a mischievous Justice Ginsburg. She has been hailed as a pioneer for gender equality, a tenacious Supreme Court justice, determined to work as long as she can make a difference on the bench.\n\nIn 2011, a year after the death of her husband, Justice Ginsburg spoke with VOA\u2019s Julie Taboh about her legacy. \u201cI hope that I will be remembered as someone who loves the law, loves her country, loved humanity, prizes the dignity of every individual, and works as hard as she can, with whatever talent she has to make the world a little better than it was when I entered it,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Ginsburg has spoken highly of both films depicting her life. Filmmaker Leder says the justice offered advice for On the Basis of Sex and fact-checked it. \u201cShe saw the film and she gave me a hug and a kiss, and that alone was incredible. I feel that women will be inspired not just in this country, but all over the world by the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which is her fight for equality, inclusion, her fight against injustice.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Departing Senators Decry America's Toxic Political Discourse", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713600.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "From Capitol Hill, a blunt message: America's political discourse is broken, threatening the nation's wellbeing and possibly democracy itself.

Posting updates to her department's website, or photocopying missives to send to constituents, she said, was mostly one-sided.\n\nBut after she set up an official Facebook page for Quang Ninh province, the conversations started to flow in both directions, between Chi and the local residents or businesses. That's why, when it comes to social media, she thinks more civil servants need to catch up with the rest of the country.\n\n\"Social media, especially the Facebook application, is really used a lot in Vietnam,\" said Chi, who is deputy head of the province's investment promotion and support office. \"But for public agencies that use it as a tool to interact with people and businesses, it's still not necessarily used a lot.\"\n\nFacebook on charm offensive\n\nEven as governments around the world are demanding more accountability and transparency from Facebook, public officials in Vietnam are looking for more ways to use the website. And Facebook is happy to oblige.\n\nThe company is on something of a charm offensive in Vietnam, where it has roughly 42 million members, nearly half the country. Besides sending top officials to visit Vietnam last year, Facebook has been instructing small businesses on how to sell their products on the site, and now it is giving civil servants like Chi advice for engaging with the public.\n\nThe chance to win some good will in Vietnam comes at a time when pressures are piling up on Facebook both inside the country and abroad. Globally, it has been accused of complicity in plots to convince voters to vote for Brexit or for candidate Donald Trump, as well as in what the United Nations calls ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The company reportedly paid for research that could damage its critics' and competitors' reputations, as well as gave users' data to dozens of other firms without consent.\n\nNew cyber law\n\nIn Vietnam, the government told advertisers to boycott Facebook and other sites in response to users' postings that criticized the one-party state. Next month, the country will enact a cyber law requiring firms to store data domestically, which Facebook opposes.\n\nBut those troubles were not front and center at a workshop in Ho Chi Minh City this month where a company representative gave bureaucrats tips on making a Facebook page.\n\n\"We have to understand and put more attention to the social aspect of the platform,\" said Noudhy Valdryno, who handles government outreach for Facebook. \"That means you have to understand your followers, who are they, where do they live, what are their interests? Then you can formulate an accurate strategy to engage with your followers.\"\n\nThe workshop included suggestions for government officials, such as posting updates on Facebook at regular intervals, shooting videos vertically to retain the attention of mobile users, and encouraging conversations among followers on the page.\n\nTech companies welcome\n\nThe event was an example of how Vietnamese officials are open to working with the tech company. It is so ubiquitous in the Southeast Asian country that when Vietnamese people say \"social media\" they mean Facebook, and when asked what newspapers they read, they give the answer: Facebook.\n\n\"What we're talking about is effective use of technology in this day and age to achieve our goals,\" said Le Quoc Cuong, vice director of the Ho Chi Minh City department of information and communications. \"What we're looking for is being effective, being engaging and enhancing cooperation between the government and the people.\"\n\nChi says more Facebook data would help her better engage with residents around Quang Ninh, a northeastern province that hugs the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Chinese border on another. She would like regular reports, perhaps every month, with information to help analyze the province's fan page, from key words to number of \"likes.\" So as many people worldwide have begun to decry tech companies for abusing and cashing in on users' data, there are those who still continue to see untapped potential in gathering further data."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "US SpaceX First National Security Mission", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-spacexfirst-national-security-mission/4713597.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSpaceX continues making news in 2018.

And a conversation with Erdogan on Dec. 14 was central to Trump\u2019s Syria move, The Associated Press reported, after Erdogan asked why U.S. forces still needed to be in the country, given the success of efforts against the ISIS insurgency there. Trump\u2019s sudden agreement on that point caught Erdogan \u201coff guard,\u201d according to the AP, and Trump quickly directed top aides to start arranging a drawback \u2015 a policy shift that almost no one in his national security circle supported and that led to the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and top State Department official Brett McGurk.\n\nIt\u2019s true that bombing and ground support for local partners by the U.S. and allies since 2014 has drastically shrunk the ISIS presence, which mushroomed amid Syria\u2019s civil war. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s political rise and presidency have been associated with politically popular criticism of U.S. intervention abroad \u2015 this is something he can say he has delivered on to his voters \u2015 and he has received some praise for the decision from detractors of the national security establishment like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nBut critics of the decision have gained traction by highlighting the rushed way it seems to have been made over the objections of Trump\u2019s advisers, and the Sunday message helps them by suggesting that he is to at least degree being guided by his long-running fixation with strongmen.

His priorities in Syria don\u2019t neatly align with those of the U.S.: While Washington prioritized weakening ISIS, he helped with that fight but was largely fixated on Kurdish militants who also became stronger as Syria fell into chaos. American policymakers have been supporting the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, which Erdogan dislikes and is ideologically linked to a rebel group that has battled the Turkish government for decades. For him, taking on a larger role in Syria will likely mean trying to curtail the Kurds\u2019 power.\n\nAdditionally, Erdogan\u2019s past relationship with ISIS is murky. While his government has targeted by the group and has cracked down on its networks in Turkey, for years it turned a blind eye to the flow of fighters and money to extremist groups involved in the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom Erdogan wanted to see ousted.\n\nThe Turkish leader has softened on Assad but continues to support fighters in Syria who may have turned on the formerly U.S.-backed Kurds. And in the course of adjusting his Syria policy and dealing with other issues like Western criticism of his record on human rights, Erdogan has grown closer and closer to Putin \u2015 a problem for the leader of a NATO member country and another reason U.S. officials are wary of fully following the Turkish lead.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest message will likely only fuel a controversy that now has even commentators close to his administration publicly fretting."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Pakistan's Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Sentenced To 7 Years For Corruption", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pakistans-former-prime-minister-sharif-sentenced-to-7-years-for-corruption_us_5c20c85ce4b0407e907d3e50", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif arrives to appear in a court in Lahore, Pakistan, on Oct. 8, 2018.\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 An anti-graft tribunal sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to seven years in prison for corruption on Monday, drawing criticism from his party, which said the decision was a \u201cblack spot\u201d on the justice system.\n\nThe verdict came after Sharif was removed from power last year over corruption allegations.

He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma and showing apparent signs of torture while in custody, according to documents filed in the suit.\n\nHowell wrote in her opinion: \u201cBefore Otto traveled with a tour group on a five-day trip to North Korea, he was a healthy, athletic student of economics and business in his junior year at the University of Virginia, with \u2018big dreams\u2019 and both the smarts and people skills to make him his high school class salutatorian, homecoming king, and prom king.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHe was blind, deaf, and brain dead when North Korea turned him over to U.S. government officials for his final trip home.\u201d\n\nThe arrest and death of Warmbier came amid heightened tension between the U.S. and North Korea over the isolated country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. President Donald Trump held a first-of-its-kind summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June 2018 and plans another next year.\n\nThe judgment may be mostly a symbolic victory since North Korea has yet to respond to any of the allegations in court and there\u2019s no practical mechanism for forcing it to do so.\n\nBut the family may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism and may look to tap into other assets belonging to the country.\n\nFred and Cindy Warmbier said they were thankful that the court found the government of Kim Jong Un \u201clegally and morally\u201d responsible for their son\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cToday\u2019s thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Howell is a significant step on our journey.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in April, describes in horrific detail the physical abuse Warmbier endured in North Korean custody.\n\nWhen his parents boarded a plane to see him upon arrival in the U.S., they were \u201cstunned to see his condition,\u201d according to court documents.\n\nThe 22-year-old was blind and deaf, his arms were curled and mangled and he was jerking violently and howling, completely unresponsive to his family\u2019s attempts to comfort him. His once straight teeth were misaligned, and he had an unexplained scarred wound on his foot. An expert said in court papers that the injuries suggested he had been tortured with electrocution.\n\nA neurologist later concluded that the college student suffered brain damage, probably from a loss of blood flow to the brain for five to 20 minutes.\n\nNorth Korea has denied that Warmbier was tortured and has said he contracted botulism while in custody.\n\nThe complaint also said Warmbier, who was from a suburb of Cincinnati, was pressed to make a televised confession, then convicted of subversion after a one-hour trial. He was denied communication with his family. In early June 2017, his parents were informed he was in a coma and had been in that condition for one year.\n\nThough foreign nations are generally immune from being sued in U.S. courts, Howell cited several exceptions that she said allowed the case to move forward and for her to hold North Korea liable. Those include the fact that North Korea has been designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism, that the Warmbiers are U.S. citizens and that North Koreans\u2019 conduct amounts to torture and hostage taking.\n\nThe penalty awarded by Howell to the Warmbiers and to Otto Warmbier\u2019s estate includes punitive damages as well as damages for economic losses, pain and suffering and medical expenses.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought on the Warmbiers\u2019 behalf by Richard Cullen, a prominent Virginia lawyer and former U.S. attorney."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Ex-Disney Actor Charged With 6 Counts In Underage Sex Case", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ex-disney-actor-charged-with-6-counts-in-underage-sex-case_us_5c2175ffe4b05c88b6fb7a68", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Former Disney Channel actor Stoney Westmoreland has been charged with six felony counts after authorities said he tried to have sex with a 13-year-old boy.\n\nWestmoreland, 48, was on the dating app Grindr when he found a profile that appeared to be an underage boy but was actually operated by a police detective in Salt Lake City, near the location where the show \u201cAndi Mack\u201d is filmed, prosecutors said.\n\nA message left with Westmoreland\u2019s agent, Mitchell Stubbs, on Monday was not immediately returned.

Actually, the wall is not a wall at all, but instead \u201cartistically designed steel slats\u201d that may or may not look like a drawing of a spiky-topped fence that he sent out Friday.\n\nAll these interpretations of his progress on his signature campaign promise, of course, have come from Trump himself, and all in the span of a few months \u2014 laying the groundwork for his Christmas government shutdown that on Monday saw Trump fold in even more chaos in a series of confusing tweets.\n\n\u201cThe Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!\u201d he wrote at 12:10 p.m.\n\nIt was unclear from the context what Trump meant by \u201cShutdown money\u201d \u2014 shutdowns cost the federal government money, not save it \u2014 and White House officials did not respond to HuffPost queries on the matter.\n\nWithin minutes, though, he wrote, \u201cI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!\u201d\n\nHis other tweets Monday roiled stock markets and perhaps the nation\u2019s allies, but on the issue of the border wall, he seemed to be tweeting primarily to soothe himself. House members were not present at all, and the Senate held a brief procedural floor session that did not include any business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and expected next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote in a joint statement. \u201cThe stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve \u2014 after he just fired the secretary of Defense.\u201d\n\nThis month, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders alike were given assurances that Trump\u2019s demands for American taxpayer money to build his wall would be postponed until after Pelosi takes control of the House in January. The Senate on Dec. 19 passed a short-term spending plan to fund the quarter of the government not already taken care of by earlier spending bills. The Senate proposal was so uncontroversial that it passed unanimously on a voice vote, with the House set to pass it on the floor the next day, Dec. 20, and Trump planning to fly down to Florida to start a 16-day golfing vacation on Dec. 21.\n\nThat plan, though, was torn up after his favorite Fox News hosts starting attacking him on the evening of Dec. 19 for abandoning his promise to build a border wall \u2014 a critique that was joined by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh the following afternoon.\n\nTrump dragged lame-duck House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to the White House to explain that he would not sign the Senate-passed spending plan, which allocated $1.6 billion for border security, including $1.3 billion to build and refurbish barriers, and instead was demanding billions of dollars more.\n\nWhere that leaves the shutdown remains unclear. The House added $5.7 billion for border security but with no guidance as to how it would be spent. A 2018 spending bill \u2014 which the Senate-passed extension would continue \u2014 includes language prohibiting Trump from building any sort of structure not already in use by 2017. That would preclude the new designs that Trump toured prototypes of last year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent his members home on Saturday and said they need not return before Thursday afternoon at the earliest. White House officials and their congressional allies by Sunday settled on the message that no resolution was possible until after Pelosi becomes speaker because liberal Democrats would not support her in the Jan. 3 House leadership election if she compromised with Trump before then.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has gone from insisting that a wall had to be made of concrete and 30 feet tall and could not be a fence \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not a fence, Jeb, it\u2019s a WALL, and there\u2019s a BIG difference!\u201d he chided GOP rival Jeb Bush in 2015 \u2014 to taking credit for the \u201cbollard fence\u201d designed and first implemented under President Barack Obama and just calling that a wall. In fact, Trump\u2019s newfound praise for \u201csteel slats\u201d appears to be endorsing the exact fence design that he previously ridiculed.\n\nIn their statement Monday, Schumer and Pelosi teed off on Trump for reversing course without offering any clarity on what he wanted. \u201cInstead of bringing certainty into people\u2019s lives, he\u2019s continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMeanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment.\u201d\n\nOne GOP consultant close to Trump said his response to the Fox and Limbaugh criticism was smart, given their influence among his hard-core supporters. Polling and focus groups conducted by a pro-Trump group, in fact, indicated that the wall remains a core issue for them, the consultant said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cTrump voters identify all his accomplishments with the wall,\u201d the consultant said, adding that caving without a fight would have been a disaster. Trump\u2019s shutdown over the issue is supported by his most loyal backers, the consultant said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to help him.\u201d\n\nA former top White House official, though, said the time for Trump to move forward with his wall was a year ago, and that believing a wall would be supported by a Democratic House without giving up major concessions on immigration that his base would hate is a fantasy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Twitter Users Brutally Mock Trump For Self-Pitying 'Poor Me' Tweet", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-poor-me-tweet_us_5c212cc3e4b05c88b6fb6306", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "For a \u201cDealmaker\u201d, you seem to have trouble understanding that in order to make a deal, you need to be talking to the other side.\n\n\n\nAnd with your history of trying to make life like a tv show (\u201cwill he sign or not?

Both men, Trump tweeted, were responsible for President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d Iran nuclear deal that he terminated earlier this year.\n\nAnd, as television news continued to focus on the extraordinary resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who also quit in protest of Trump\u2019s Syria pullout, Trump sought to reassert his worldview that allies are taking unfair advantage of the U.S. and its taxpayers.\n\n\u201cGeneral Mattis did not see this as a problem.

Voters rejected the citizen initiative last month, 53 to 47 percent. Three other red states passed similar measures the same day.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nPerhaps the chief takeaway from the rejected citizen initiative to expand Medicaid in Montana last month is this: Be careful when you poke a giant.\n\nMontana was one of four red states with Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and the only one where it failed. And the reason why, many close observers both inside and outside of the state agree, almost certainly came down to a tactical decision to link expansion to an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax.\n\nSupporters thought that strategy would boost their effort with voters, but it attracted Big Tobacco into the fight, along with the $17.2 million it spent, much of it on a television advertising blitz. Opponents raised nearly $19 million to defeat the measure, finance reports filed with the state show.\n\nProponents, with about $9.7 million to spend, simply couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\n\u201cIt was impossible with the money we had to compete,\u201d said one of the leaders of the coalition, who spoke with Stateline but asked not to be named because the coalition has not yet publicly addressed what went wrong. The tobacco interests \u201cgot too far ahead with their messaging.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, this activist said, it may have been a mistake to combine Medicaid expansion and a tax that targeted a deep-pocketed opposition.\n\nThe tobacco industry went nowhere near the other states where Medicaid expanding initiatives appeared on November\u2019s ballot: Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Medicaid expansion plans passed comfortably in those states, but the Montana version fell decisively, 53 to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cThe basic lesson is that if you create a big political target, don\u2019t be surprised if people pay attention to it,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIf you propose to raise tobacco taxes, don\u2019t be surprised if tobacco pushes all its chips in. The same happens when you try to raise soda taxes.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is a government-supported health insurance for the poor, and each state has an option to expand that program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAdam Searing, an associate professor at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, noted that the only difference between Montana and the three other states was the inclusion of a specific tax in the Montana initiative. That inclusion diluted the central message of the ballot measure, he added.\n\n\u201cBasically it seems the more you focus on that central issue of expanding affordable health care to more working class people, the more successful you are likely to be,\u201d Searing said of the success in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that advocates in other non-expansion states might want to take to heart as they continue their fight \u2014 which they are vowing to do, despite the ruling earlier this month by a federal judge in Texas that the entire ACA, including the Medicaid expansion provision, is unconstitutional.\n\nMany legal analysts on both the left and the right say the decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in a lawsuit brought by Republican governors and attorneys general from 20 states is unlikely to stand. In any case, the ACA will remain in place while the ruling makes its way through the appellate courts, perhaps ending up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fairness Project, an advocacy group that reportedly spent $6 million in support of the initiatives in November, names Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming as states where Medicaid expansion initiatives could reach the ballot in 2020. Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the project, said the ruling in Texas hasn\u2019t dampened the group\u2019s conviction that most Americans support expansion.\n\nIn a tracking poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation the week after the midterm elections, 59 percent of voters in non-expansion states said they favored expansion.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid already had been expanded by law in 2016 to include any adult with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line. In 2018, that translates to $16,753 for an individual. Before the expansion, only Montana low-income adults who were caregivers, pregnant or disabled qualified for Medicaid.\n\nBut that 2016 expansion had been set to expire in July 2019. The ballot proposal last month, Initiative 185, would have made the Medicaid expansion permanent. (The other three states will see expansion for the first time.)\n\nNow it will be up to the Republican-controlled legislature to determine the future of the expansion in Montana, a high priority for popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C., have adopted Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nExpansion proponents in the Treasure State think their losing campaign this fall, which entailed a grassroots operation, will pay off with a legislative victory in the winter.\n\nThe pro-expansion campaign, said Jessica Rhoades, Bullock\u2019s health policy adviser, \u201ccreated a volunteer network of very motivated nurses and doctors who can go into the legislative session with a strong base of support behind them.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming Montana House speaker, said court ruling in Texas is worth paying attention to, but it won\u2019t halt work in Montana to craft a Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s financially sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re still forging ahead,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nThe legislative session begins Jan. 7, and lawmakers already are crafting bills in preparation for upcoming hearings, Hertz said. Republicans are interested in cost-control measures that could include performance audits and work requirements for single, able-bodied adults, he said.\n\nMontana Senate President Scott Sales, also a Republican, agreed that expansion proponents will still have the votes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d spoken to me a few days before the court ruling, I\u2019d say Medicaid expansion is going to pass in some form; I think that\u2019s still the case,\u201d Sales said.\n\nFinancial mismatch\n\nThe $19 million raised in opposition to the campaign, 91 percent of it from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, is more than twice the amount spent on Montana ballot measures since at least 2006, data compiled by FollowTheMoney showed. The nonprofit, which tracks campaign spending, found it was also more than $7 million above the amount spent by all candidates in the last Montana gubernatorial election, in 2016.\n\nSupporters of Initiative 185 raised $9.7 million, also more than previous Montana ballot measures. That coalition \u2014 Healthy Montana for I-185 \u2014 included groups representing hospitals and health care providers in the state as well as advocacy groups representing the poor, retired people and labor unions. It also included state chapters of national organizations that support efforts to end diseases, such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\n\nProponents say the financial mismatch doomed the initiative even as pre-election polls had shown voters evenly divided on the measure. Montana State University, for example, reported in late October that 41.4 percent of Montana voters were in favor of expansion versus 40.8 percent against, with a 2 point margin of error.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this article, Chuck Denowh, the spokesman for Montanans Against Tax Hikes \u2014 created for the Medicaid campaign \u2014 and president of the Montana Group, a Helena political and public relationship consulting firm, said he was on a family vacation and couldn\u2019t respond. He did not respond to a request to designate someone else with the organization. Altria did not respond by deadline to a request for an interview.\n\nOther factors besides big spending by tobacco may have contributed to the loss.\n\nThe ballot language began with a description of the tax increase, and that didn\u2019t help, said Jesse Cross-Call of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy and research think tank in Washington. \u201cUnless you were intimately aware of it before going into the voting booth, it was hard to know what was at stake. It looked like the initiative was about raising taxes rather than extending health care to more people.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s measure proposed a general sales tax increase and the initiatives in Idaho and Nebraska left it up to the legislature to decide how to pay for the expansion.\n\nBut, according to Rhoades, early polling suggested that linking a tobacco tax to expansion would improve its chances. That doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case.\n\nCoalition members pushed for the tobacco increase not only as a source of financing for the expansion, but also as a discouragement to smoking, which itself, Healthy Montana claimed, costs Montanans $440 million in health care every year.\n\nThe initiative would have increased the tobacco tax by $2 for a pack of 20 cigarettes. It also would have increased taxes on snuff and created a tax on vaping.\n\nFewer uninsured in Montana\n\nBy March of this year, Montana\u2019s Medicaid had extended benefits to 94,000 newly eligible beneficiaries, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. Bullock\u2019s office said expansion, along with other elements of the Affordable Care Act, reduced the uninsured rate in the state from 15 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent today.\n\nIn its economic analysis, the university report said expansion has injected $350 million to $400 million of new spending into the state each year. That money has generated about 5,000 new jobs and will produce about $270 million in personal income in each year between 2018 and 2020, the report found.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs, with its portion gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. That\u2019s compared with 65.5 percent for traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe proponents of Initiative 185 said the increased tobacco taxes, which they estimated would\u2019ve raised an additional $74 million a year by 2023, would pay for that extra 10 percent.\n\nThe university report estimated that after 2020, when the federal match drops to 90 percent, the increased state tax revenue from the economic activity generated by the expansion would be enough to cover the state\u2019s expansion costs without raising taxes or creating new ones.\n\nThat is the position Bullock has taken in urging the legislature to pass expansion next year. The governor\u2019s proposal does not call for an increase in tobacco taxes but would include a small increase in taxes on medical providers.\n\nBut that was not the message of the initiative\u2019s opponents, who ran ads claiming \u2014 falsely, proponents say \u2014 that the proposed tobacco increase would not cover expansion costs. All Montanans would end up footing the bill, their ads proclaimed.\n\nThe looming question, of course, is what will happen in the legislature. Some of those who led the campaign for expansion have told Stateline they are pessimistic, fearing legislators who are inclined to vote against can now point to the election results to justify a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nCasey Schreiner, the incoming House minority leader and supporter of expansion, said he wasn\u2019t overly worried.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the legislature sees the benefit of taking the sunset off,\u201d the Democrat told Stateline, referring to the July 2019 expiration of the current Medicaid expansion plan. \u201cEverybody understands what happened, that a large amount of money got dumped into Montana and the initiative was mischaracterized as a tax increase rather than expanding health care."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Doctor's Note Policies Punish Students For Being Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-doctors-note-policies-poverty_us_5c1bfc6fe4b05c88b6f66933", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s said that during the holidays, all roads lead home \u2015 or, for those who have access, to the doctor.\n\nThe holiday season is like being invited to a white elephant gift exchange only to find out that each beautifully wrapped box contains a different variation of stomach virus, cold, strep or the flu. Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "2018's Most Horrific Sign Of Things To Come Was People With Disabilities Dying In Disasters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-2018-disasters-climate-change-disabilities_us_5c1bc563e4b0407e90784909", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "To mark the end of 2018, we asked writers to revisit some of the year\u2019s most noteworthy (for good or evil) events, people and ideas. See the other entries here between now and the new year.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Jim Knaver and his wife, Anna Hastings (known as Toni), spotted a little smoke in the air from their home in Paradise, California. They knew the risks of fire and had diligently cleared any flammable debris from their property. Jim checked the news for fire danger, he later told NPR, then drove to teach his fourth-grade class. Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate. Later that morning, the Camp Fire roared through Paradise at unprecedented speed. Without transportation or even the means to flee on foot, Toni couldn\u2019t get out. Jim lost touch over the phone around 11 a.m. Five days later, search teams confirmed they had found Toni\u2019s remains.\n\nWe live in an era of flood and fire. That disasters like the Camp Fire and the devastating hurricanes that have struck the U.S. in recent years are more frequent and more severe because of human-caused climate change is an indisputable scientific fact. Unless something changes, as the waters rise and the air grows thick with smoke, as medicines run out and food systems collapse, as higher, wetter, or more fertile ground becomes the only resource that matters, millions of people like Toni \u2015 millions of poor and non-wealthy, elderly, people with disabilities \u2015 are going to die.\n\nThere has never been a threat to humanity quite like catastrophic climate change. First, while most great disasters spring upon us quickly, we\u2019ve known the threat has been coming for almost 200 years. Second, we now have the technology to ameliorate the worst of the consequences, which is again unprecedented in human history. We couldn\u2019t have stopped the Black Death, for example, but the decarbonization of society is possible. Instead, year after year, things get worse, and we still do nothing. Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history. The green technology thus far deployed will have no more effect than pouring a thimbleful of water on a raging blaze.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen the worst happens, disabled people will die first. The problems extend far beyond wheelchair users who cannot physically evacuate through inaccessible areas. For example, I am mentally disabled. Without access to psychiatric medication, I wonder whether I could stave off suicidal ideation in the face of local climate collapse. Think about all the people who require insulin, chemotherapy, specialized nourishment pumped into their stomach, or people who can\u2019t access a shelter because it has no ramp or because crowds make them panic. The threats extend across categories.\n\nIn November, Alice Wong, a Bay Area resident and global disability justice leader, wrote about receiving air quality alerts as smoke from the fires more than 160 miles away made it dangerous to go outside. She knew she was privileged to stay home with her air purifier but rightly worried for those with lung-related conditions who lacked homes, access to masks, or other medical support.\n\nMarcie Roth, former FEMA official and currently CEO of the National Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, tells me there\u2019s been a \u201cfailure to plan. And a failure to meet the equal access requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate change adaptation folks are not really talking to the disaster risk reduction folks who are not really talking to the humanitarian relief folks who are not really talking to the CRPD [U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] folks who are not really talking to the strategic development/plan folks,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much siloing going on.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Roth argued that lack of planning for inclusive disaster relief puts everyone at risk, writing, \u201cA resilient community will plan for \u2013 and with \u2013 all of its members.\u201d\n\nWe can fix this. Not only can we focus our disaster responses on the most vulnerable people, but we can elect representatives who are willing to say the word, \u201cdecarbonization.\u201d As the 2020 Democratic Primary begins (it\u2019s already begun), who will be brave enough to speak up for those already being killed by climate change?

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Renews Attack on Fed as Mnuchin Tries to Calm Markets", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/politics/trump-renews-attack-on-fed-as-mnuchin-tries-to-calm-markets.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "For the markets, the Fed is a complicated player at the moment. Investors have been disappointed by rising interest rates, concerned that they could sap growth. But the speculation about firing Mr. Powell, a move that could turn the independent central bank into a political tool, has undermined confidence in a pivotal institution essential to economic policy.\n\nMarkets have already been on edge in recent weeks because of uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between the United States and China, signs of slowing global growth, and the prospect of a prolonged government shutdown in the United States. Mr. Mnuchin added to the economic jitters by announcing on Sunday that he had called bank executives to ensure the markets were functioning properly, the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis.\n\n\u201cIt signaled a sense of panic and anxiety that didn\u2019t need to be there,\u201d said Brian Gardner, an analyst at the investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cMy first reaction when I heard it was, what has happened over the last couple of days that the market does not understand or realize? Is there something that Treasury knows that the rest of us don\u2019t?\u201d\n\nAnd while Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney tried to reassure markets on the Fed\u2019s leadership, there is still an effort within the White House to discern whether any legal rationale exists for removing Mr. Powell from the chairman spot, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nPeter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, has been openly critical of the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates and blamed the central bank for the market volatility. Mr. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said the recent stock swings are the result of high-speed electronic trading and post-crisis financial rules that he says make it harder for banks to play their traditional market-stabilization role."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Economy Is Strong.

The American consumer appears strong; this is looking to have been one of the strongest holiday sales seasons in many years.\n\nSurveys of supply managers, which act as an early warning system for slowdowns in business activity, are in strongly positive territory. In the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s surveys, an index above 50 indicates the economy is in expansion; its most recent reading was 62.1 for the manufacturing sector and 60.7 for services.\n\nThe most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.\n\nFor example, the two-year Treasury bond yielded 2.56 percent at Monday\u2019s close. That\u2019s still higher than the roughly 2.4 percent where the Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight rate now sits. You would expect that if a recession were imminent, the two-year yield would fall lower, reflecting expectations of Fed rate cuts to combat the downturn.\n\nAt this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.\n\nMost economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.\n\nIn this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts. To the degree there is a market correction and adjustment in business sentiment, it is about realizing that we\u2019re returning to the old new normal."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Stocks Close in on Bear Market as Trump and Mnuchin Fuel Christmas Eve Drop", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/business/stock-markets.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Wall Street extended its losses on Monday as President Trump continued to lash out at the Federal Reserve, and an unusual weekend statement about the health of America\u2019s financial system by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, unnerved investors rather than calmed them.\n\nStocks are experiencing their worst decline since the financial crisis a decade ago amid worries about, among other things, a slowing of corporate profits and the impact of a trade war on global growth.\n\nMr. Trump has become increasingly focused on the idea that the Fed chairman, Jerome H.

Rima Rudd, a longtime health literacy researcher at Harvard University, has persistently criticized the communications skills of health institutions and professionals.\n\n\u201cWe give people findings and tell them about risk and expect people to make decisions based on those concepts, but we don\u2019t explain them very well,\u201d she said. \u201cAre our forms readable? Are the directions after surgery written coherently? If it\u2019s written in jargon, with confusing words and numbers, you won\u2019t get the gist of it and you won\u2019t get important information.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, Steven Rosen, 64, had spent more than two months at a Chicago hospital after several surgeries. Then a social worker came into his room and told his wife Dorothy, \u201cYou have to move him tomorrow to an L.T.A.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Ms. Rosen recalled saying. \u201cWhat\u2019s an L.T.A.C.?\u201d\n\nQuestion: Was she demonstrating inadequate health literacy, or should the social worker have clarified that L.T.A.C.s \u2014 long-term acute care hospitals \u2014 provide more care than nursing homes for very ill patients?"}]
