Liquidity is the term used to refer to the ability of banks to lend money to clients.\n\nThe CEOs who spoke individually by phone Sunday with Mnuchin were \"totally baffled\" by the sessions, according to a person familiar with the calls, who said the executives found the encounters puzzling and largely unnecessary.\n\n\"It was totally out of left field and an odd thing to do,\" the person said, describing the timing of the calls -- on a Sunday before markets opened -- as strange.\n\nThe markets closed on Christmas Eve, a day after the round of calls, with the Dow dropping 653 points.\n\nCEO says political noise causing market concerns\n\nAfter Mnuchin asked on his calls whether their banks were seeing any liquidity issues, the executives all replied they were not.\n\nLater, the treasury secretary asked whether there were any other issues going on that the executives might see as affecting the markets, according to the person. Another person familiar with the matter said the secretary took the initiative to reach out to the CEOs.\n\nOne of the CEOs responded by saying political noise from Washington -- including trade fears, the departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis and the government shutdown -- were among the drivers causing concern in the markets.\n\nMnuchin was in \"listening mode,\" the person said, and the calls were not described as contentious.\n\nAfterward, there was a belief among some executives that Mnuchin was attempting to assert himself, to show he was in charge, and to soothe markets all during a vacation in Mexico that was garnering criticism because it came in the middle of a government shutdown (Mnuchin traveled on a commercial plane and was spending time with his children).\n\nMnuchin calling CEOs and issuing the statement was a \"pre-emptive measure\" after last week's market volatility, according to a Treasury official. \"This was meant to be a reassuring step and it was consistent with what the Secretary thought bankers would say,\" the official said.\n\nBut some of the bank executives and analysts were taken aback by the public nature of the Treasury statement reading out the calls -- which placed the liquidity matter front and center, when in fact there is no real crisis at hand.\n\n\"This is the type of announcement that raises the question of whether Treasury sees problems that the rest of the market is missing,\" Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients. \"Not only did he consult with the biggest banks, but he is talking to all of the financial regulators on Christmas Eve. We do not see this type of announcement as constructive and worry that it can trigger the vary panic that Treasury wants to avoid.\"\n\nMnuchin convened a roughly 15-minute call on Monday with the President's Working Group on financial markets, which includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve and top market and business regulators, to ensure all the agencies were well-coordinated to monitor markets appropriately during the government shutdown, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe secretary's calls Sunday to the big bank CEOs came after a turbulent week on Wall Street and were described as a \"prudent check-in\" with major market participants of how they thought the economy was performing.\n\nSeiberg noted it's normal for the Treasury secretary to talk to the biggest banks after a week of stock market turmoil, but he views the calls to bank CEOs and convening the call with regulators as a sign that the market needs reassuring about liquidity, margin and clearing.\n\n\"It raises the question of why Treasury needs to reassure if everything is okay,\" Seiberg wrote.\n\nTrump's frustration ratchets up\n\nTrump has directed much of his frustrations over the markets on his treasury secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Trump has vented that Mnuchin's recommendation of Jerome Powell for the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve was a fateful mistake. Trump has told some advisers that he views selecting Powell the worst decision of his entire presidency.\n\nBut beyond that, Trump has complained more broadly that Mnuchin isn't doing enough to stabilize markets, the person said, viewing recent plunges as a sign his team hasn't assured investors of the economy's strength. Trump was particularly frustrated that a tentative trade deal with China on tariffs did not provide a boost in the markets -- something Mnuchin and other advisers said would happen if an agreement was struck.\n\nThe central object of Trump's frustration remains Powell, who last week announced another hike in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The move, widely expected, caused markets to tumble. Trump is not alone in his criticism of the rate hikes; many economists say there is little economic reason to keep increasing rates.\n\nYet Trump has taken outsized umbrage at the moves, deeming them designed to damage him politically. He's taken to scrutinizing Wall Street fluctuations as a barometer of his political standing, and has asked his advisers whether dips in the market will harm his re-election prospects.\n\n\"The only problem our economy has is the Fed,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Monday. He was spending the day at the White House after the government shutdown prevented him from traveling to his resort in Florida. \"They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!\"\n\nHis frustrations have risen so high that Trump has asked his team whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell -- a move that Mnuchin, among others, has worked hurriedly to prevent. Mnuchin has been working for the past several days to convince Trump that he cannot fire his Fed chairman -- both from a legal standpoint and to avoid further market turmoil.\n\nSpeaking on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday, incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump \"now realizes he does not have the authority\" to fire Powell -- a suggestion the issue had recently been raised.\n\nTrump, however, still believes Powell is to blame for the instability and wants to ensure he's getting the message. He's raised the possibility of sending an envoy to meet with Powell directly, according to the person familiar. And while Mnuchin has encouraged Trump that any moves toward firing or downgrading Powell would be catastrophic, some other White House advisers have taken a less grave view, which has given Trump an opening to discuss it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Stocks are having worst December since Great Depression", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/3QQqtxhN8NQ/stocks-worst-december-great-depression.cnn-business", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "The Dow is down 7.8% and the S&P 500 is down 7.6% this month.

For the past month, they have been contending with confusion and disorder.\n\nUncertainty abounds at the end of a volatile year: Investors question the Federal Reserve's plans for 2019, and President Donald Trump asked aides if he could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Congress entered a budget stalemate with the president, partially shutting down the government. Trade policy that for years tried to stitch economies together is in retreat. Economists warn that the pace of US economic growth will slow next year.\n\nTo cap that off, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin issued a bizarre statement Sunday , saying he called top bank executives to assess their liquidity. He asked if they had the ability to continue lending to consumers and businesses \u2014 at a time when confidence in banks had been high.\n\nThat set already jittery investors on edge. Stocks followed their worst week since the Great Recession by plummeting yet again Monday . The last time the market fell this much in December was in 1931 , during the Great Depression.\n\nInvestors are now worried about five big items going into 2019.\n\n1. Mnuchin may know something we don't. Or not\n\nBear markets happen. Several stock indexes are down 20% from their highs, yet US markets' descent has happened relatively gradually \u2014 until recent weeks.\n\nMnuchin used crisis language when he said banks have \"ample liquidity\" and \"markets continue to function properly.\" No outward signs pointed to a crisis, contagion or liquidity concern in the financial system. Suggesting as much jolted the stock market.\n\nTrump has complained that Mnuchin hasn't done enough to stabilize markets, according to a person familiar with the matter. The statement left observers wondering: Was Mnuchin trying to placate Trump, or does he know something the markets don't know?\n\n2. The mix of higher rates and slowing economy growth\n\nBusinesses and investors were already on high alert because rates are going up as economic growth is slowing. They have good reason to worry that Powell's Fed may be too aggressive on its rate increases. The Fed lowered its growth estimate for the US economy last week, and it is notoriously horrendous at predicting recessions.\n\nIf it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants.\n\nThe Fed signaled it would raise rates only twice next year after raising them four times in 2018. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams sought to reassure investors Friday that the Fed will remain flexible about its rate-raising and balance sheet policy if the markets take a turn for the worse. But investors weren't buying it: The Dow fell more than 400 points Friday.\n\n3. Trouble at the Fed\n\nThe Fed is only doing its job : It is expected to independently assess the state of business and the economy and determine the best course of action for monetary policy. Yet Trump threatens to undermine a Fed chair that he appointed his own appointed Fed chair by publicly criticizing him and privately asking if he can fire him.\n\nInvestors may not like the uncertainty that higher rates could bring \u2014 but firing the Fed chair 10 months into his term would be a different can of worms entirely.\n\nFor months, Trump has been lashing out at Powell, the nominee Trump considers the worst of his presidency. Trump believes Powell is to blame for this year's market turmoil, but few thought Trump would actually fire him, which could create chaos in the markets. Yet CNN and other media reported that Trump has begun polling advisers about whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell.\n\nMnuchin tried to calm markets Saturday by tweeting that Trump never suggested that he would fire Powell \u2014 and Trump doesn't believe he has the right to oust the Fed chair. But Trump's ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis months ahead of his planned resignation date concerned investors that Trump may not be listening to his advisers.\n\nits their \"touch.\" On Monday morning, Trump again attacked the Fed , likening it to a golfer who has losttheir \"touch.\"\n\n4. Shutdown showdown\n\nThe government shutdown probably won't mean much for the economy in the near term, but Washington's dysfunction isn't a great sign.\n\nFar more meaningful than a shutdown is Congress' duty to lift the debt ceiling later next year.\n\nAfter starting to recover after the Great Recession, federal deficits are rising again \u2014 and that means Treasury will have to borrow more to make up the gap between what the government spends and brings in. Lawmakers must pass a law next year so Treasury can continue to borrow without any restrictions. If they fail, the government could default on its debt.\n\nThat very nearly happened in 2011, and credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's downgraded America one notch below a perfect AAA. Another downgrade could make the United States' already massive debt load much costlier to pay back.\n\n5. Trade\n\nThe US-China trade war is on hiatus until March, but it still looms over the economy and markets.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if China fails to meet US demands on a variety of economic and political issues.\n\nTrade has dominated much of the conversation in 2018. It says a lot about the chaos in Washington that trade is currently the least of the market's concerns."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Presidents play with fire when they brag about the stock market", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/d68rhEEsDXw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump took full ownership of the stock market boom.

The 47-year-old walked out the door of his basement apartment a month ago and never came back.\n\nThe story of Samuel Oliver-Bruno and the church that tried to protect him made national news.\n\nVideos of his arrest at an immigration office went viral. So did the images of religious leaders, church members and supporters locking arms as they surrounded an ICE van in a standoff that lasted hours.\n\nBut there was another circle of people you didn't see that day.\n\nThey were inside other churches just miles away, glued to their phones and laptops, filled with a growing sense of dread.\n\nThey panicked as they watched live video of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents handcuffing their friend and taking him into custody.\n\nThey grieved when they learned he'd been deported to Mexico less than a week later.\n\nAnd they faced a harrowing question that's still haunting them as they prepare to spend another Christmas inside churches they're afraid to leave:\n\nWill I be next?\n\n\"We are in the same situation,\" says Juana Tobar Ortega, who's been living in a North Carolina church for nearly 19 months. \"And we see that things are getting worse.\"\n\nA community shaken\n\nOne by one, the announcements of immigrants taking shelter in churches fell like dominoes across the country after President Trump took office.\n\nHis administration's crackdowns triggered a new chapter in a movement that began in the 1980s with congregations across the US sheltering Central American immigrants facing deportation.\n\nThey are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to Nearly two years into Trump's presidency, about 50 people are living in sanctuary inside churches nationwide, according to Church World Service.They are searching for solutions to their immigration cases and hoping ICE will stick to its policy of not arresting anyone in \"sensitive locations\" -- schools, hospitals or houses of worship -- except in extenuating circumstances\n\nSamuel Oliver-Bruno's shoes are still inside the room where he lived at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham. ICE agents arrested him when he went to an appointment at an immigration office, then deported him to Mexico.\n\nWhile only a sliver of churches have joined the sanctuary movement, advocates say it's growing -- and North Carolina has been fertile ground.\n\nChurches in some of the state's more liberal-leaning cities led the way. Two churches in Greensboro first opened their doors. Then congregations in the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill followed suit.\n\nFor much of this year, according to one nonprofit , North Carolina was the state with the largest number of churches hosting immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nCityWell United Methodist Church in Durham was among them. That's where Samuel Oliver-Bruno took sanctuary. His sudden arrest at a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office, where he'd been asked to give fingerprints as part of his application for deferred action, left a shaken community searching for answers.\n\nICE says agents arrested Samuel as part of a \"targeted enforcement action.\" He'd used a fraudulent Texas birth certificate when he entered the United States in 2014. And his case had been subject to extensive appeals since then, ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said.\n\nICE has maintained that Samuel's detention and deportation were \"in full accordance with federal law and agency policy.\" Any foreign national who's in the United States illegally is subject to arrest and removal, the agency says, no matter how long they've been living in a so-called sensitive location.\n\n\"Mr. Oliver-Bruno is a convicted criminal who has received all appropriate legal process under federal law, has no outstanding appeals and has no legal basis to remain in the US,\" Cox said.\n\nBut Samuel's supporters describe him as a devoted father and husband who'd lived in North Carolina with his family for much of the last two decades. He'd been seeking a humanitarian waiver to stay in the United States to support his wife, who suffers from lupus and other serious illnesses.\n\nAuthorities deported him this month.\n\nAnd it's not just immigrants in sanctuary who are reeling as a result. So are the churches that took them in.\n\nA seamstress mourns for her friend -- and an uncertain future\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega smiles as soon as she hears the knock on the door.\n\nShe's been preparing for this moment for hours. It will be a welcome respite after weeks of grief. Ever since Samuel's arrest, she's struggled to stop crying.\n\nIt's time for the posada, a traditional Latin American singing ritual re-enacting Joseph and Mary's search for shelter the night Jesus was born -- with half the group playing the role of the innkeeper, and the other half playing the role of pilgrims looking for a place to stay.\n\nJuana Tobar Ortega and several family members look on as the Rev. Audra Abt preaches at a holiday service. \"I want to thank you, Juana, for your faith and for your strength on this very difficult journey,\" the pastor said.\n\nJuana and her family are the innkeepers this year. They open the door, and at first sing lyrics spurning the uninvited guests.\n\n\"This is not an inn. I don't take in strangers. You might be a robber. I can't risk that danger.\"\n\nThe symbolism isn't lost on Juana or members of the church where she's been living for nearly 19 months. Juana was the first immigrant to seek sanctuary in a North Carolina church after Trump's election. She began living at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro on May 31, 2017 , decades after she first came to the United States from Guatemala seeking asylum.\n\nJuana lost her asylum case, but she'd been checking in regularly with ICE since 2011. Each year, officials renewed a stay on her removal order, allowing her to remain in the country. That changed after Trump took office. When she went to her check-in that year, officials outfitted her with an ankle monitor and said she had just a few weeks to leave the country.\n\nJuana decided seeking sanctuary was her only option. Saint Barnabas opened its doors and welcomed her.\n\nJust like Juana does at the end of today's song:\n\n\"Enter, enter, holy pilgrims, holy pilgrims. Welcome to my humble home. Though it's little I can offer, I can offer, all I have, please call your own.\"\n\nChristine Merriman loved seeing Juana at the door, letting visitors in.\n\nA church member who's spent hours by Juana's side as part of a rotation of volunteers who stay with her, Merriman says only one thing was missing.\n\n\"We should have built a border wall out of cardboard blocks,\" she says, \"then knocked it down.\"\n\nJuana laughs.\n\n\"Maybe next year we can,\" she says.\n\nThen she pauses.\n\nThis is her second Christmas in sanctuary. She hopes she won't be here for a third.\n\nBut she's afraid she will.\n\nShe never thought she'd be here this long. The 46-year-old seamstress lives in a narrow room with concrete walls covered with artwork her grandchildren covered in words of encouragement:\n\n\"USA is a free country.\"\n\n\"We know your not leaving.\"\n\n\"If unicorns love each other, we all love each other.\"\n\nAmid festive preparations for a celebration just days before Christmas, Samuel's recent deportation comes up and the mood turns somber. \"We didn't expect such bad news,\" Juana says as her granddaughter Koral Bridguett leans in to comfort her.\n\nSewing and art projects help Juana pass the time. Her four children, two grandchildren and other family members often visit on weekends. But when they're gone, depression sinks in.\n\nAnd in the last few weeks, she says, grief has overwhelmed her.\n\nShe spoke with Samuel on a weekly conference call for people in sanctuary. She'd heard how excited he was about moving forward with his case. He told the group he was doing it for all of them, not just for himself.\n\nHis arrest was a chilling reminder of a reality she'd hoped was changing.\n\n\"There is no mercy at all for us,\" she says.\n\nFor Juana, seeing how many people supported Samuel was the only blessing. It helped her remember she's not alone.\n\nA pastor waits in sanctuary, praying for a way out\n\nJos\u00e9 Chicas flips open his laptop, logs into Facebook and gets ready to hit record.\n\nIt's almost 4 a.m. -- time for the daily prayer he broadcasts to the world.\n\nBehind him, newspaper articles on the wall tell the story of a preacher who's been separated from his flock.\n\n\"Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandonado en santuario,\" one headline reads. Pastor Jos\u00e9 Chicas abandoned in sanctuary.\n\nBuoyed by support from the Rev. William Barber, Jos\u00e9 Chicas took sanctuary in the School for Conversion, on the grounds of a Durham Baptist church, in June 2017.\n\n\"That church can be your sanctuary until it is worked out in the courts,\" Barber told a rally last year . \"Let them come into the house of God and try to seize a child of God!\"\n\nIn a strip mall storefront some 30 minutes away, Jos\u00e9's wife is trying to keep their evangelical church afloat on top of her job on the cleaning crew at a local university. But the congregation's ranks have thinned. Some didn't like the idea of a woman preaching. Others felt Jos\u00e9's case was taking too long.\n\nSo now, Pastor Jos\u00e9 prays online in live videos shared with anyone who will listen.\n\nHe sways in his seat and taps his foot on the floor as he asks God for help -- for marriages that are suffering, for people who haven't found Jesus yet, for those who have strayed.\n\nJos\u00e9 believes in redemption. Using drugs and alcohol put him on a dangerous path, he says -- one that led to a conviction for DUI and domestic abuse. But those days, he says, are long ago. He draws on them to shape his sermons but says he's a changed man.\n\n\"I was lost. I will never forget that day, February 28, 2002. I changed my life,\" he says in this morning's prayer.\n\nHis voice crescendos with each sentence. This is a story he never tires of telling.\n\n\"I never touched a beer or a cigarette again,\" he says, \"because Christ changes man.\"\n\nHe misses preaching from the pulpit. Tomorrow dozens of people from his Raleigh congregation will visit for a Christmas dinner. He's been counting the days. He has gifts for all of them wrapped in his room.\n\nThis morning, the screen says only one person is watching. But Jos\u00e9 knows with each passing minute, his online flock will grow.\n\nHe prays for his 11-year-old son, who's been suffering from a stomachache and struggling in school. He prays for members of his church and for people who've posted on his Facebook wall asking for help. He prays for migrant caravans, for the Venezuelan people, for people facing violence in his native El Salvador. He prays for his neighbors and the city that's supporting him.\n\nBut those aren't the only people on his mind.\n\nAn evangelical pastor, Jos\u00e9 begins every day with a 4 a.m. prayer that he broadcasts live on Facebook.\n\nHe also prays for Samuel, whose photo still hangs on the wall in the next room, beside pictures of other immigrants in sanctuary.\n\nActivists once had dubbed them the \" NC Sanctuary 6 .\" They became the \"NC Sanctuary 5\" after a court let one of them leave the church where he'd been living.\n\nAnd now there are four.\n\nJos\u00e9 applied for the same humanitarian protection as Samuel. He doesn't know why Samuel was the first to get a letter from immigration officials, asking him to come in for an appointment. Jos\u00e9 knows he could have been the one who ended up in the back of an ICE van the day after Thanksgiving. Watching video of the arrest made his heart sink.\n\n\"Make a miracle, Lord, for my brother Samuel ... have mercy. He was just deported to Mexico, blessed father.\"\n\nThe prayer doesn't end there. Jos\u00e9 also prays for the officials who deported Samuel. He knows firsthand how God's power can transform people.\n\n\"Lord, hallelujah, have mercy, touch these immigration officers. ... Touch them. Change them,\" he says. \"Blessed God, we are not criminals, father.\"\n\nHe pauses to wipe away tears welling up in his eyes, then keeps praying.\n\nSanctuary's somber side\n\nFor immigrants living in churches, the public side to sanctuary is only part of the picture.\n\nYes, beautiful friendships are formed between people who never realized how much they had in common. And new groups of advocates step up to take a stand.\n\nBut after the fanfare of the first few days, the press conference, the push for community support, there is another side to sanctuary-- a painful reality made even more acute by Samuel's arrest.\n\nOn a bulletin board at Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Greensboro, church members and Juana's family have posted reasons why they're grateful.\n\nThe Monday mornings alone when loved ones have left and pews are empty.\n\nThe sleepless nights and the crushing desire to stay in bed.\n\nThe lack of privacy and the fear of being alone.\n\nThe buoyancy of feeling embraced by strangers and the devastation of feeling abandoned by friends.\n\nThe constant search for a way out. The fear it may never come.\n\nFacing questions he doesn't know how to answer\n\nWith his children by his side, Eliseo Jimenez joins his church in prayer.\n\n\"Every month we need healing,\" the congregation says in unison, \"but December can be the hardest time of year.\"\n\nThis will be Eliseo's second Christmas in sanctuary.\n\nHe's been living here almost 15 months.\n\nBeing separated from his children each week is devastating. There's a white board on the wall of his bedroom where his kids -- 6-year-old Allison and 5-year-old Christopher -- like to doodle when they come to visit.\n\n\"I love you dad,\" Allison wrote.\n\n\"Me too,\" Eliseo replied.\n\nEliseo Jimenez and his 5-year-old son Christopher watch a worship service at Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh. Jimenez, 40, has been living in the church since October 2017.\n\nBut being with his kids is hard, too. Allison asks questions he's not sure how to answer. Why can't he go to the park to play with them? Why doesn't he go home with them on Sunday nights? Eliseo tries to change the subject. He doesn't want to ruin their childhood.\n\nWhen they visit, they spend most of their time playing inside. Eliseo's skittish being outdoors, even in the church parking lot.\n\n\"I have to be on the lookout for any strange car or any person,\" he says. \"It's always the fear to go outside and be distracted playing with the kids, and there might be somebody.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico has lived most of his life in the United States. He was deported once in 2007. And since October 2017, he's been living here, in Umstead Park United Church of Christ in Raleigh, to try to keep that from happening again.\n\nSamuel's picture is on a bulletin board near the room where Eliseo sleeps. About a year ago, Samuel visited Eliseo, asking for advice before going into sanctuary.\n\nFind something to do around your church, Eliseo told him, \"fixing, cleaning or helping anybody possible with anything.\"\n\nThat, Eliseo says, is what's kept him sane.\n\nToday, as he sits in the church's second row, Eliseo looks with pride at something he built that's on display behind the pulpit -- a miniature replica of the stable where Jesus was born.\n\nThe children's director mentions it as she calls kids to the front of the room for their portion of the Sunday service.\n\n\"During this season we like to talk about hope and peace,\" Peg Arcari says. \"We can talk about spreading joy. If somebody says they need help, we should share and be kind to one another.\"\n\nAs the children circle around her, Arcari points to Eliseo's work.\n\n\"By creating this stable,\" she says, \"Allison and Christopher's dad spread some joy.\"\n\nEliseo tries to keep things as normal as possible for his kids when they come to visit. But they've started to ask questions he doesn't know how to answer, like why he can't play in the park or go with them out to dinner.\n\nBeing stuck in here over the holidays is difficult. But Eliseo says he's lived through worse.\n\nSeveral years ago, he spent Christmas inside the Stewart Detention Center in South Georgia, the largest immigrant detention center in the Southeast . Authorities threatened to deport him that week. They put him on a bus and said they were sending him back to Mexico.\n\nThe only way he could convince someone to listen to him was by smashing his head so hard into a seat that he started bleeding. Then they double checked his files and discovered that an attorney had submitted a new petition for him to stay in the country.\n\nEliseo was released from custody that day. He says an official told him as long as he stayed out of trouble and kept checking in with ICE, he'd be in the clear. But Eliseo says that changed for him and so many others after Trump took office. They suddenly found their work permits weren't being renewed and long-delayed deportation orders were taking effect.\n\nSince the day he left Stewart, he hasn't been able to shake the feeling of constant fear. No matter what happens with his case, he doesn't think he ever will.\n\nHaunting nightmares\n\nThe glow of holiday lights reflects on Rosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz's face as she sits beside a small Christmas tree.\n\nIn a matter of days, her children will be visiting, but she doesn't feel much like celebrating.\n\nShe feels trapped inside the room where she's living. Last night she couldn't sleep. She's been crying all morning.\n\nSince she entered sanctuary at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill in April, Rosa has regularly spoken with her children on the phone. Their photos hang on the wall in the converted office that's become her bedroom. \"I love my babies,\" one picture says. But visits can be heartbreaking. It crushes her every time her children walk out the door.\n\nAn immigration court in Charlotte has ordered her deportation. But Rosa is appealing. She never expected the wait for an answer would take so long.\n\nShe jumps every time her phone rings, hoping her attorney is calling with news.\n\nAnd since Samuel's arrest, she's felt even more on edge. She's afraid to talk on the phone about her case -- and afraid of what will happen next.\n\n\"There's a heightened level of fear,\" says the Rev. Isaac Villegas of Chapel Hill Mennonite Fellowship, which rents space at Church of Reconciliation and is co-hosting Rosa in sanctuary. \"We have someone at the church 24 hours a day just to make Rosa feel safer and to keep her safe.\"\n\nRosa del Carmen Ortez-Cruz chats with volunteer Libby Johnson as she makes pupusas at Church of Reconciliation in Chapel Hill. The two women have become close friends since Rosa began living at the church in April.\n\nRosa is terrified to return to Honduras, a country she fled after her partner stabbed her. She says he's threatened to kill her if she ever returns.\n\nWhen she does manage to sleep, a recurring nightmare haunts her. Night after night, she dreams immigration agents are chasing her.\n\nSometimes she wishes she would fall asleep and not wake up. Then, she says, the real-life nightmare she's living would end.\n\nAs Rosa tears up, Libby Johnson offers a hug.\n\nRosa smiles. The warm embrace, and the love she's received from Libby and so many others at the church, have given her strength in her darkest hours.\n\nShe's grateful God put so many good people in her path.\n\nThe day Samuel was detained, Libby was one of 27 supporters who were arrested.\n\nAs she rushed to the immigration office that day, she thought of the many hours she'd spent with Rosa, and how important it is to stand up for others and live the morals the church teaches.\n\n\"It's a call,\" she says. \"If you really want to walk your talk, then you need to take risk.\"\n\nTaking a risk to help undocumented immigrants seems to be something more churches in the area are interested in doing after Samuel's arrest, Villegas says. Several new congregations have come forward to say they want to host someone in sanctuary.\n\nHe tells anyone who's interested that they need to be prepared to stick it out for the long haul.\n\n\"This could be multiple years,\" he says, \"because Trump won't change anything.\"\n\nThe hole he left behind\n\nSamuel's room at CityWell is empty, but it's full of reminders of the life that was lived here and the man who is missing.\n\nWedding photos are taped to the armoire door. Notes he took during a Duke Divinity School class are sitting on a nearby table. So is a stack of books he'd been studying. \"Aprenda Ingl\u00e9s para Conversar\" -- Learn English for Conversation -- is at the top.\n\nA sign on the door still says, \"Oliver Family's Home.\"\n\nThe room is still and quiet, but the church's pastor still hears Samuel's voice every time he walks by.\n\nThe music minister thinks of him when he passes by the prayer room across the hall that Samuel -- who'd worked for years as a drywall contractor -- helped build.\n\nUpstairs in the worship hall, someone taped a sign to the wooden chair where Samuel used to sit during services.\n\n\"Samuel's seat,\" it says. \"Keep praying.\"\n\nA sign marks the chair where Samuel Oliver-Bruno used to sit during services at CityWell United Methodist Church. The Rev. Cleve May says his congregation is grieving, but not giving up. \"The story of God in this world is God showing up in the midst of injustice and oppression,\" he says.\n\nThe Sunday after his deportation, Samuel sent the church a video message from Mexico. It was broadcast on TV screens during services.\n\n\"Even though I am in my country, I feel afraid,\" he said. But he added that the North Carolina congregation was still giving him strength.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, I love you all a lot. You will always be with me. Everywhere I go I will talk about all of you, about how much love and support you gave my family.\"\n\nSince Samuel's arrest, CityWell pastor the Rev. Cleve May says he and others have been wrestling with tough questions about the sanctuary movement's future.\n\n\"One of the gambles the sanctuary movement makes is that ICE really doesn't want to kick the hornet's nest of people with privilege,\" May says. \"If you traumatize their church, they're going to throw a real stink. The publicity of this is a deterrent to ICE.\n\n\"It has been thought that the public exposure of sanctuary would serve as a prophylactic to ICE aggression, that surely they wouldn't come somewhere where the light is really bright. I'm not sure we can bank on that anymore.\"\n\nHe sees Samuel's arrest as a violation of sanctuary.\n\nThose who went with Samuel to his appointment were praying and singing religious songs outside the immigration office.\n\n\"For us it was a statement that sanctuary is not a building,\" he says. \"It was people saying to a person, 'You belong with us and we stand with you.'\"\n\nCelebrating the holidays without Samuel is difficult, May says, but darkness and joy can coexist. Grieving the loss has become part of the church's identity.\n\n\"The presence of God doesn't erase the presence of pain,\" he says.\n\nAnd nothing will erase the many ways Samuel shaped the church and his friends there.\n\nIn worship, he says, they're still singing songs Samuel taught them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Church puts fence around Nativity scene to make statement about immigration", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/zefyQ_2qL4I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A church in Oklahoma put a fence around its Nativity scene to send a message: \"The Holy Family Was A Migrant Family.\"\n\nChris Moore, pastor of the Fellowship Congregational Church in Tulsa, said there's a parallel between migrants who come to the US-Mexico border seeking asylum and the Christmas story.

Liquidity is the term used to refer to the ability of banks to lend money to clients.\n\nThe CEOs who spoke individually by phone Sunday with Mnuchin were \"totally baffled\" by the sessions, according to a person familiar with the calls, who said the executives found the encounters puzzling and largely unnecessary.\n\n\"It was totally out of left field and an odd thing to do,\" the person said, describing the timing of the calls -- on a Sunday before markets opened -- as strange.\n\nThe markets closed on Christmas Eve, a day after the round of calls, with the Dow dropping 653 points.\n\nCEO says political noise causing market concerns\n\nAfter Mnuchin asked on his calls whether their banks were seeing any liquidity issues, the executives all replied they were not.\n\nLater, the treasury secretary asked whether there were any other issues going on that the executives might see as affecting the markets, according to the person. Another person familiar with the matter said the secretary took the initiative to reach out to the CEOs.\n\nOne of the CEOs responded by saying political noise from Washington -- including trade fears, the departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis and the government shutdown -- were among the drivers causing concern in the markets.\n\nMnuchin was in \"listening mode,\" the person said, and the calls were not described as contentious.\n\nAfterward, there was a belief among some executives that Mnuchin was attempting to assert himself, to show he was in charge, and to soothe markets all during a vacation in Mexico that was garnering criticism because it came in the middle of a government shutdown (Mnuchin traveled on a commercial plane and was spending time with his children).\n\nMnuchin calling CEOs and issuing the statement was a \"pre-emptive measure\" after last week's market volatility, according to a Treasury official. \"This was meant to be a reassuring step and it was consistent with what the Secretary thought bankers would say,\" the official said.\n\nBut some of the bank executives and analysts were taken aback by the public nature of the Treasury statement reading out the calls -- which placed the liquidity matter front and center, when in fact there is no real crisis at hand.\n\n\"This is the type of announcement that raises the question of whether Treasury sees problems that the rest of the market is missing,\" Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients. \"Not only did he consult with the biggest banks, but he is talking to all of the financial regulators on Christmas Eve. We do not see this type of announcement as constructive and worry that it can trigger the vary panic that Treasury wants to avoid.\"\n\nMnuchin convened a roughly 15-minute call on Monday with the President's Working Group on financial markets, which includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve and top market and business regulators, to ensure all the agencies were well-coordinated to monitor markets appropriately during the government shutdown, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe secretary's calls Sunday to the big bank CEOs came after a turbulent week on Wall Street and were described as a \"prudent check-in\" with major market participants of how they thought the economy was performing.\n\nSeiberg noted it's normal for the Treasury secretary to talk to the biggest banks after a week of stock market turmoil, but he views the calls to bank CEOs and convening the call with regulators as a sign that the market needs reassuring about liquidity, margin and clearing.\n\n\"It raises the question of why Treasury needs to reassure if everything is okay,\" Seiberg wrote.\n\nTrump's frustration ratchets up\n\nTrump has directed much of his frustrations over the markets on his treasury secretary, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Trump has vented that Mnuchin's recommendation of Jerome Powell for the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve was a fateful mistake. Trump has told some advisers that he views selecting Powell the worst decision of his entire presidency.\n\nBut beyond that, Trump has complained more broadly that Mnuchin isn't doing enough to stabilize markets, the person said, viewing recent plunges as a sign his team hasn't assured investors of the economy's strength. Trump was particularly frustrated that a tentative trade deal with China on tariffs did not provide a boost in the markets -- something Mnuchin and other advisers said would happen if an agreement was struck.\n\nThe central object of Trump's frustration remains Powell, who last week announced another hike in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. The move, widely expected, caused markets to tumble. Trump is not alone in his criticism of the rate hikes; many economists say there is little economic reason to keep increasing rates.\n\nYet Trump has taken outsized umbrage at the moves, deeming them designed to damage him politically. He's taken to scrutinizing Wall Street fluctuations as a barometer of his political standing, and has asked his advisers whether dips in the market will harm his re-election prospects.\n\n\"The only problem our economy has is the Fed,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Monday. He was spending the day at the White House after the government shutdown prevented him from traveling to his resort in Florida. \"They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt!\"\n\nHis frustrations have risen so high that Trump has asked his team whether he has the legal authority to fire Powell -- a move that Mnuchin, among others, has worked hurriedly to prevent. Mnuchin has been working for the past several days to convince Trump that he cannot fire his Fed chairman -- both from a legal standpoint and to avoid further market turmoil.\n\nSpeaking on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday, incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump \"now realizes he does not have the authority\" to fire Powell -- a suggestion the issue had recently been raised.\n\nTrump, however, still believes Powell is to blame for the instability and wants to ensure he's getting the message. He's raised the possibility of sending an envoy to meet with Powell directly, according to the person familiar. And while Mnuchin has encouraged Trump that any moves toward firing or downgrading Powell would be catastrophic, some other White House advisers have taken a less grave view, which has given Trump an opening to discuss it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Chief Justice pauses contempt order for mystery company in Mueller investigation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/7pGHoNVhanM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "The order puts on hold the contempt citation issued by a DC federal judge against the company related to a grand jury subpoena it received, but only long enough for the justices to decide whether they want to intervene in the case.\n\nThe company asked the Supreme Court to intervene after a federal appeals court ruling that ordered the company to comply with the subpoena, which required it to turn over \"information\" about its commercial activity in a criminal investigation. The Supreme Court action also paused fines the company was facing for every day of noncompliance.\n\nThe pause lasts until the court has time to review a response from the government due on or before December 31.\n\nThe request to the Supreme Court is the latest twist in the secret case, much of which is under seal and has made its way through the federal court system with uncommon speed.\n\nThis is the first known legal challenge apparently related to Mueller's investigation to make its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court could separately be asked to hear an appeal of the case.\n\n\"So far as we know, the Court has never had a sealed argument before all nine justices,\" said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"They can keep parts of the record and briefing sealed, and often do, such as in cases implicating trade secrets. But there's no procedure in the court's rules for having the whole case briefed, argued and decided under seal. The only times I'm aware of in which parties tried it, the court denied certiorari,\" or the review of the case.\n\nThe company's challenge of the subpoena appears to have begun in September. In its ruling this past week, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia offered few clues about the company and its country of origin or what Mueller's team sought.\n\nIn one short passage in the three-page decision, the judges describe how they had learned confidentially from prosecutors that they had \"reasonable probability\" the records requested involved actions that took place outside of the United States but directly affected the US. Even the company was not informed of what prosecutors had on the issue, because revealing it to the company would have violated the secrecy of the grand jury investigation, the judges said.\n\nThe range of possibilities on the identity of the company is vast. The company could be anything from a sovereign-owned bank to a state-backed technology or information company. Those types of corporate entities have been frequent recipients of requests for information in Mueller's investigation.\n\nAnd though Mueller's work focused on the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors have said and CNN has reported that the Mueller team looked at actions related to Turkish, Ukrainian and other foreign government interests.\n\nMueller previously indicted three Russian companies and 25 Russians for their alleged contributions to a social media propaganda scheme meant to influence American voters and to the hack of the Democratic Party. The special counsel and other Justice Department units continue to pursue several investigations related to Mueller's core mission.\n\nAnother challenge of a Mueller subpoena, from Roger Stone associate Andrew Miller, began at the trial level months before the anonymous company's action apparently began. Miller's case is now before the DC Circuit as well but has not yet been decided by the judges. His case became public after his attorneys publicly spoke about his intention to challenge Mueller and the subpoena.\n\nThe company in the Supreme Court challenge has stayed secret---as has the grand jury proceeding it's related to. And both the company, prosecutors and the circuit court took pains to keep the identities of those involved in the case under wraps. An entire floor of the DC federal courthouse was locked down by security on the morning of the company's appeal argument, so that the lawyers entering and leaving the courtroom would not be seen."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "McCaskill warns Dems about 'cheap' rhetoric; says GOP senators privately believe Trump is 'nuts'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/gfn_nW3uldw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sen. Claire McCaskill has some advice for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming freshman who has rapidly risen from obscurity to one of the most well-known figures in the Democratic Party: Talk is cheap.\n\nMcCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who's in her final days in office after losing her bid for a third Senate term, told CNN in a wide-ranging interview that her party must begin to focus and deliver on real issues to attract independent and white working class voters -- not pie-in-the-sky policy ideas, such as tuition-free college, that have little chance of becoming law. Her concern: Voters grow cynical after hearing campaign promises that never go anywhere, empowering forces like President Donald Trump to rail against Washington for failed promises, as he did in 2016.\n\nDemocrats, she suggested, should be cautious about the rise of politicians like the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, who vanquished a Democratic leader, Joe Crowley, in her primary, and have vowed sweeping changes in policy.\n\n\"I don't know her,\" McCaskill said when asked if she'd consider Ocasio-Cortez a \"crazy Democrat\" like the ones she decried on the campaign trail. \"I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good example of what I'm talking about, a bright shiny new object, came out of nowhere and surprised people when she beat a very experienced congressman.\"\n\nMcCaskill added, \"And so she's now talked about a lot. I'm not sure what she's done yet to generate that kind of enthusiasm, but I wish her well. I hope she hangs the moon.\n\n\"But I hope she also realizes that the parts of the country that are rejecting the Democratic Party, like a whole lot of white working class voters, need to hear about how their work is going to be respected, and the dignity of their jobs, and how we can really stick to issues that we can actually accomplish something on.\"\n\nAnd she concluded: \"The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.\"\n\nIn the interview, the blunt-speaking Missouri Democrat, reflecting on her election loss to Republican Josh Hawley -- a political novice whom she also referred to as a \"bright shining object\" -- also didn't mince words for the Republican Party.\n\nWhile she warned that history \"will judge some of my colleagues harshly that they didn't stand up to this President at some of the moments where he has been unhinged about particularly the rule of law,\" she also said that GOP senators have privately conceded they can't speak out against Trump because of backlash they'd receive from their base.\n\n\"Now they'll tell you, if it's just the two of you, 'The guy is nuts, he doesn't have a grasp of the issues, he's making rash decisions, he's not listening to people who know the subject matter,' \" she said. \"But in public if they go after him ... they know they get a primary, and they know that's tough.\"\n\nShe declined to single out individual Republicans, but when asked about Sen. Lindsey Graham and the South Carolina Republican's alliance with Trump, she said: \"It's kind of weird to me, I don't know what happened with Lindsey.\"\n\n\"This is Donald Trump's Republican Party,\" McCaskill said. \"Make no mistake about it.\"\n\nAs she sat back in her chair in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing room, where she served as the ranking Democrat, she said of Trump, \"I mean, he's almost the master of, 'I'm going to do so much stuff that's crazy that nobody notices crazy anymore.' \"\n\nOne instance, she cited, in particular was when the rapper Kanye West spouted off on a wild, profanity-laced tirade in the Oval Office -- all in front of the television cameras.\n\n\"I mean, Kanye West was in the Oval Office M-F---ing on live TV,\" McCaskill said, seemingly perplexed. \"I mean, think about that. That is crazy weird. Can you imagine would have happened if that happened during the Obama years? ... The lid would have blown off this place.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think Fox News Channel would have gone up in some kind of spontaneous combustion, had that happened (during the Obama years). But it happens under Trump and it's like, well, just another day at the office. So there is a numbing that's gone on, that some of the craziest stuff that he says and does is not as noticeable because there's so much of it.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Trump's brash style and popularity with conservative voters helped turn the tide against McCaskill. He held multiple campaign events for Hawley, railing on McCaskill and castigating her as a far-left liberal out of step with more mainstream voters.\n\n\"He camped out so often in Missouri the last 30 days I figured he was building a golf course,\" McCaskill said.\n\nIn 2006, she eked out a victory against then-Sen. Jim Talent, helping Democrats take control of the Senate -- and in 2012 when then-President Barack Obama lost her state by 10 points, she pulled off a victory due in large part to the controversies of her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded when he downplayed pregnancies caused by rape.\n\nThis time, she faced a 38-year-old, telegenic Republican with little political experience -- something Hawley used to his advantage against the 65-year-old McCaskill, who has nearly four decades in politics.\n\n\"In most professions and careers, the more experience you have, the better, the more valuable you are to the people that you work for. In politics, not so much anymore,\" McCaskill said. \"There was a sense that, maybe she has been around long enough.\"\n\nWhat turned the tide, in McCaskill's view, was the raging fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Trump's 1th-hour rhetoric against migrant caravans approaching the southern border only added to that, and said it amounted to \"whipped cream and the cherry on top of the ice cream\" to drive up GOP turnout.\n\nBut she contended that it was the fight over Kavanaugh, whom she voted against, that ultimately did her in.\n\nAsked if she believed she would have won re-election had there not been a Supreme Court vacancy, she said: \"I think it would have been much more likely.\"\n\nAs one of the country's most vulnerable Senate Democrats, McCaskill had been the subject of a furious onslaught by GOP outside groups -- namely a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about her views on McConnell, she said she believes that \"every decision\" the GOP leader makes is based on whether it helps Republican senators.\n\n\"He is a very, very political leader,\" McCaskill said of McConnell. \"This isn't somebody who is sitting around at night figuring out how he can move the needle on really important policy issues. This is someone who is figuring out how he can win elections and beat Democrats like me.\"\n\nAs her Senate term now comes to an end, McCaskill vowed \"never\" to become a lobbyist but said she will now use her style of \"mouthing off\" in her next line of work. She said she's not waiting to use her mouth now to give advice to her party as candidates line up to take on Trump in 2020.\n\n\"Donald Trump got elected partially because there was such cynicism that we can't get anything done here. And the way you get things done here is by reasonable negotiation and compromise,\" McCaskill said of the 2020 race. \"Somebody who talks about leading in that direction is the one that can win places like Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and maybe even compete in a place like Missouri.\"\n\nAsked if her colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is weighing a White House run, could win in those states, McCaskill said, \"I don't know.

As the year began to take shape, it felt finally as though the first lady was going to actually be a first lady.\n\nAnd then the rug came out from under her. Twelve days into the new year, the story of Stormy Daniels broke, and Trump was thrust into a scandalous, salacious and tabloid-style drama, and where before she could close out the world and retreat, now she was the most well-known woman in the world; hiding was not an option.\n\nAs such, 2018 would become the year Melania Trump had to figure out how to handle her duties in public as the first lady, while balancing a marriage under the microscope, in the not-so-private.\n\nThough she started the year emotionally and, at times, physically distanced from President Donald Trump, Trump was buoyed by public sympathy, a large swath of the country felt genuinely sorry for her after the Daniels story unfurled. She moved forward, eventually, displaying a fiery independent streak, piecing together her wing of the White House, and constructing what would ultimately become a platform for helping children.\n\nShe learned how to communicate via statements and tweets and non-verbal cues, without the need for approval from the West Wing, whether her philosophies conjoined with her husband's or not, and they often didn't.\n\nDonald Trump is a prolific name-caller; Melania Trump decided to tackle online bullying.\n\nDonald Trump's administration enforced a zero-tolerance policy of separating illegal immigrant families; Melania Trump flew to the border, twice, to see for herself how she could affect a change in process.\n\nDonald Trump slammed LeBron James' intellect in a tweet; Melania Trump, via her spokeswoman, praised James for his charity work.\n\nDonald Trump insisted on picking the channels to be viewed on Air Force One; Melania Trump, again via her spokeswoman, watches \"any channel she wants, by the way.\"\n\nFor most of 2018, as the odd division between the first couple just became another quirk of the Trump presidency we all got used to, the first lady reaped the benefit of her solo act. Her popularity in polling was far and away the highest of any Trump family member, any Trump administration member, really. Her decisions and actions were sometimes emboldened and had positive results, but some events dramatically missed the mark (that jacket, for example).\n\nHowever, the last several weeks of 2018 have seen a different side of Trump, especially as she has found more solid footing, growing into her role. She has embraced a more forward-facing partnership with the President, and not just physically -- there is markedly more \"natural\" hand-holding and affection between the couple of late -- but intellectually and politically. It is a move that has given Trump more of a voice, and more of a public persona, and chipped away at the mystery of who she really is. But as the year draws to a close, the first lady might be closer to her husband, but it appears to be at a cost to her popularity.\n\nA study in stoicism\n\nIf the country wondered what Melania Trump was feeling after the news broke her husband had allegedly been unfaithful with adult film star Stormy Daniels, a claim he has repeatedly denied -- just months after she had given birth to the couple's only child -- they needed only to read her silence and her independence.\n\nOn January 30, two weeks after Daniels became a household name, Trump skipped out on an otherwise mundane tradition: instead of arriving with the President in his motorcade from the White House to the US Capitol for his State of the Union address, she took a separate car, leaving her husband to ride alone. It was a shocking split with the norm, and a flash of the independent streak the country had begun to witness from the first lady -- she was, quite understandably, unwilling to feign the smile and hand-holding endured by political spouses before her when scandal had wreaked havoc.\n\nInstead, she would attempt to sidestep it altogether, her spokeswoman telling CNN at the time Trump took the separate motorcade in order to have more time with her special State of the Union guests.\n\nBy the time the first lady was introduced prior to the President's address, all eyes were on her as she emerged into the gallery, dressed in a white pantsuit, similar in style to the ones favored by Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. And noticeable, as well, for the signal of suffragettes, who wore white. It would be the first time in 2018, though certainly not the last, that some would wonder if the first lady of the United States was \"trolling\" the President of the United States.\n\nShe had, just days prior, canceled her trip to Davos, Switzerland, at the last minute where she had planned to accompany Trump to the World Economic Forum. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's director of communications, cited scheduling and logistics issues, but it was clear to many Trump was still reeling from news cycles overwhelmed with Stormy Daniels stories, and the implications of alleged payoffs and private maneuvering.\n\nOn January 22, days before they were to depart together, the couple's 13th wedding anniversary went unnoticed by either spouse on social media -- questions as to how they spent the day or evening in celebration went unanswered by both the East Wing and the West Wing communications offices.\n\nPerhaps most telling of the start of the year was how Trump marked the last year gone by. A year to the day after she had become first lady, Trump posted on her social media accounts a throwback photo of herself, not with the President on Inauguration Day, but with an anonymous military escort, her arm looped through his, her smile pinned on.\n\n\"This has been a year filled with many wonderful moments. I've enjoyed the people I've been lucky enough to meet throughout our great country & the world!\" she captioned the image, without a mention of her husband.\n\nTragedies would bind the first couple back together, or at least back to events with one another -- the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for example, where both visited with victims and first-responders. Melania Trump has long-been noted as being the more compassionate member of the first couple, and with her, the President adds to his persona a much-needed softness.\n\nDealing with accusations against her husband\n\nTrump, however, didn't make a public speaking engagement until the end of February, spending a few minutes at a podium at the White House addressing governors' spouses at a luncheon; it would be six weeks from the day the Stormy Daniels story broke that the public would hear her voice.\n\nYet if January had been stormy, March would bring another torrent of sordid headlines, now belonging to Karen McDougal, whose accusations of an adulterous affair with Donald Trump were far more personal and detailed. McDougal recounted her story to Anderson Cooper, dropping in how she had toured Melania's own home, and saying she and Trump had told one another they loved each other, and how emotionally tied she had been to Melania's husband.\n\n\"What can you say except I'm sorry?\" she told Cooper in a lengthy televised interview, apologizing to Melania Trump for the alleged affair, which the President has denied. \"I'm sorry. I wouldn't want it done to me.\"\n\nTrump answered by not answering -- going radio silent, refusing to appear beside her husband before the two departed for a scheduled trip to Mar-a-Lago for spring break. Eschewing at the last moment the traditional walk across the South Lawn to Marine One, the presidential helicopter that typically ferries them to their plane at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, Trump called once again for a separate motorcade, arriving on her own and boarding Air Force One ahead of her husband and out of sight of the press.\n\nIt was the day after McDougal's interview aired.\n\nSpringing forward\n\nIn April, Melania Trump found herself with two choices: stay under the radar and continue with her now notorious privacy spate, or emerge, boldly, to carry on with her duties.\n\nShe chose the latter.\n\nIn April, the Trumps welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, to Washington, for the Trump administration's first official State Visit. It came, of course, with the first State Dinner, something Trump had been planning for weeks prior, overseeing every detail of the evening, from the chair covers (cream) to the menu (rack of lamb).\n\nIt was, \"a smaller, more elegant event,\" Grisham told CNN at the time, with approximately 100 guests and everything Melania Trump wanted for her first major White House hosting gig. \"[The first lady] has a background in design, which played a major role in the d\u00e9cor throughout the State floor. ... She has been very focused on the experience of the guests, and wants to ensure they are able to truly enjoy and remember the occasion.\"\n\nThe details were executed with perfection, from the silver sequined Chanel Haute Couture gown she wore in homage to French fashion, to the gifted photo album of the two-days of events Trump had made for the Macrons upon their departure, accompanied by a Tiffany & Co. silver bowl to commemorate the occasion.\n\nIt was, after all, her moment; one she had claimed upon the Macrons arrival, not with a welcome speech or a hug and a handshake but rather a white hat, a big, wide-brimmed chapeau by her personal couturier, made to match her white Michael Kors suit. With the hat, Trump would tell the world the day was going to be hers and not her husband's -- and every headline followed her lead, mentioning Trump's choice of attention-stealing headwear, a signal she was perhaps done playing the role of backstage spouse.\n\nMelania Trump's popularity peaked in early May of this year at 57% following the State Dinner, according to a CNN poll, a public coming-out of sorts for the extremely private first lady. It was also on the heels of Trump's solo trip to Houston, Texas, to attend the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush, where she posed, smiling, for a photograph with living former presidents and first ladies, many of whom have icy relationships with her husband.\n\nSpring also signaled the launch of Be Best , the official platform of Trump's tenure. The initiative, which she announced, at her insistence, in the Rose Garden of the White House, would focus on children in three ways, including their overall well-being, their activities on social media, and their interaction with the country's ongoing opioid crisis. It was a lot to include for one platform, and while critics had things to say about her ambitious plans, Trump attempted to forge ahead, having already addressed the swipes she would take for trying to tackle cyberbullying while her husband had fast-become the most public Twitter bully in the land.\n\n\"I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\" said Trump at an event in the spring. \"I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right.\"\n\nYet the launch of Be Best was practically inextricably hampered by what would come next for Trump in an already difficult year.\n\nA health scare\n\nIn May, she would also be hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center for a kidney procedure, one that would keep her out of the public eye for several weeks, and lead people to wonder if her health was stable.\n\nHer office, as had become customary, was tight-lipped, releasing only a few details, and guarding with intensity her schedule. Trump spent almost one week in the hospital following what the White House said was an \"embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition.\"\n\nIt wasn't until weeks after the procedure, as rumors peaked that the first lady had a more serious condition, or that she was hospitalized with something other than what her office had said, that President Trump let fly the true severity of her hospital stay.\n\n\"She had a big operation,\" Trump said to the media on his way to the G7 Summit, indicating the first lady had wanted to join him, but that doctors wouldn't allow her to travel for 30 days. \"That was a close to a four-hour operation. And she's doing great.\"\n\nA forceful fall\n\nIf the kidney procedure defined her spring, as the scandals had her winter, it would be a summer of independence and recovery before her footing regained itself with more ferocity in the fall.\n\nOctober would see Trump's first international, solo trip, to Africa. Tackling a schedule that included visiting four countries in five days, Trump partnered with USAID to bring awareness to children in the region, and to the programs the United States had in place to assist several African nations.\n\nTrump was well-received, for the most part. She had a sartorial fail in Kenya, wearing a white pith helmet while on safari, an unintentional signal of that region's colonial era, a dark spot in Kenya's collective history. She was attacked in the media. And while fashionable to the point of looking straight out of a Vogue photo shoot in her head-to-toe cream pantsuit with Chanel hat, all worn to see the pyramids and the Sphinx in Egypt, she was ridiculed for looking very much like a costume.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip. We went to Ghana. We went to Malawi. We went to Kenya. Now here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip and not what I wear,\" Trump snapped to the press during an impromptu question and answer session, her first on-the-record since becoming first lady. \"That's very important, what I do, what we're doing with USAID, my initiatives, and I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" she said.\n\nThe bristle was all the more intense considering another fashion gaffe just months prior, when she wore a $35 Zara jacket with the words \"I really don't care, do u?\" emblazoned on the back, while getting on and off her government jet while going to visit immigrant families in Texas in the midst of the border crisis, when the news was filled with stories of children being separated from their parents.\n\nThe border issue was something Trump would later say she was \"blindsided\" by, and something she told her husband he needed to do something about in order to end it. But the jacket usurped the intended good she had wanted to do by visiting the border for herself, the first Trump family member to have done so -- it would become the calling card for her critics, a moment of sheer tone-deafness that Trump later chalked up to sending a message to the meddling media.\n\nThe fallout from the jacket, while intense, wasn't all that was on Trump's mind, however, as she pushed forward with Be Best, visiting children's hospitals and schools, holding discussions on everything from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome to practicing kindness on social media. Forging ahead with trying to define a legacy separate from her husband's bluster, and her own inherent need for privacy.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nAs the year drew to a close, Trump's strength -- and influence -- was growing.\n\nAfter a nasty dust-up between members of her East Wing staff and Mira Ricardel, a senior national security adviser to President Trump, occurred in the wake of the Africa trip over details surrounding travel space and the withholding of assets, the first lady didn't bite her tongue.\n\nAfter trying to signal to her husband that she felt Ricardel was working against her staff, to no avail, Trump took matters into her own, very public hands.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" Grisham released in a statement in November, when the feud had reached an untenable place.\n\nWhile not unusual that a first lady would be weighing in on West Wing staffing issues -- something Nancy Reagan and Hillary Clinton both did, behind closed doors, during their tenures -- it was historic for a first lady to so openly call for the dismissal of a member of the President's administration. Within days, Ricardel was fired from the White House.\n\nThose who know her, and who work for her, say one of Trump's great strengths is her loyalty, and her commitment to doing what she feels is best for her team. But the outward optics of her weighing in, and getting results, signaled this first lady was not completely devoid of influence over her husband; in fact, she wielded a great deal of influence.\n\nTrump had shown a glimmer of that side of her marriage during an interview she gave in October to ABC News, stealthily suggesting she was behind the departure of West Wing aides.\n\n\"I give him my honest advice and honest opinions, and then he does what he wants to do,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked what her husband did when she suggested some staffers couldn't be trusted, the first lady replied, \"Well, some people, they don't work there anymore.\"\n\nIt was during that same interview that Trump also revealed she doesn't just protect her husband, she often thinks like him, too.\n\nOn immigration, Trump said, \"I believe in the policies that my husband put together, because I believe we need to be very vigilant who is coming to the country.\"\n\nAnd she also revealed her personal struggles, perhaps not ginning up as much sympathy as she might have anticipated.\n\n\"I could say I'm the most bullied person on the world,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You're really the most bullied person in the world?\" ABC News' Tom Llamas asked in return.\n\n\"One of them, if you really see what people saying about me,\" Trump said.\n\n#MeToo and Melania\n\nThat apparent disconnect was an echo of her thoughts on another hot topic of the year: the #MeToo movement\n\nDuring the thick of the debate over the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump said accusers needed to present evidence of their claims.\n\n\"If you accuse (someone) of something, show the evidence,\" Trump said during an impromptu news conference in Africa. \"I support the women and they need to be heard. ... We need to support them and, you know, also men, not just women.\"\n\nWhile it's not entirely unexpected, of course, that the political beliefs of the first lady match more closely with those of the President than perhaps originally thought, the bubble of \"what ifs?\" surrounding the mystery of Trump's possible antithetical beliefs to those of her husband popped.\n\n\"I do stand with women, but we need to show the evidence. You cannot just say to somebody, 'I was sexually assaulted,' or, 'You did that to me,' because sometimes the media goes too far, and the way they portray some stories it's, it's not correct, it's not right,\" she said during the same conference with reporters in Africa.\n\nMore recently, in a December interview on Fox News, Trump again drew fire for her remarks about the most difficult part of her job as first lady. Choosing to answer in a way that only focused on her personal turmoil, Trump lashed out in a way that felt very much like her husband, in both tone and tenor.\n\n\"I would say the opportunists who are using my name or my family name to advance themselves, from comedians to journalists to performers, book writers,\" she replied.\n\n\"Does it hurt?\" asked Fox News' Sean Hannity, who conducted the interview during Trump's holiday visit to the crew aboard the USS George H.W. Bush. \"It doesn't hurt. The problem is they're writing the history and it's not correct.\"\n\nThe fallout and the future\n\nThe public is responding to the newer, more vocal mood of the first lady, and they aren't loving her as much as they did the quieter version. In a December CNN poll, Trump's favorable rating stood at just 43%, down from 54% just two months prior, a stunning double-digit plummet.\n\nAs author and CNN contributor Kate Andersen Brower says, the more outspoken side Trump has displayed is clearly having an effect on her popularity.\n\n\"I think Trump supporters are passionate defenders of the first lady and I think that most people, Democrats included, want to like her,\" said Brower, author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\"\n\n\"The problem becomes when she weighs in on highly charged political issues like the Me Too movement or when she makes it clear that she's influencing her husband on personnel decisions. It's not a coincidence that the CNN poll showing her declining approval ratings came out after she got (Ricardel) fired. No other modern First Lady has done that so publicly.\"\n\nNot that Trump is one to particularly care about poll numbers, or anything the public might speculate about, most of which rings hollow to the first lady if it isn't about her work with children. It has long been the message of Grisham that Trump is going forward, not backward, in spite of negative chatter, intent on doing her own thing, unrelated to perception or expected norms. (Similar, again, to the untraditional approach her husband has taken over in the West Wing.)\n\nAnother notable trait of the first lady is her nonchalant demeanor under the gaze of the prying eyes of a public who want to know more about her. It's a protective armor of sorts that has served her well in some scenarios, such as the Daniels and McDougal scandals, and kept her from exposing any personal weakness.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump is a strong and independent woman who has been navigating her role as first lady in her own way,\" said Grisham of her boss.\n\nAs the dawn of 2019 is upon her, Trump's focus is squarely on the positive points of becoming a first lady who is finding her voice and her mission, and not the failures and foibles of 2018. Her relationship with her husband appears stronger than ever. Asked recently if she loves him, Trump smiled her mysterious smile, and said, \"Yes. We are fine. Yes.\"\n\nAnd the scandals that started her year have somehow stayed in her rear-view mirror.\n\n\"I am a mother and a first lady, I have much more important things to think about and to do.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Widespread and dangerous': Facing medical uncertainty, doctors tell patients it's all in their heads", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7R1i_Fbwsnk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) When 7-year-old Bailey Sheehan arrived at a hospital in Oregon partially paralyzed, a doctor said the girl was faking her symptoms to get her parents' attention because she was jealous of her new baby sister.\n\nBut that doctor was proved wrong when an MRI showed that the girl had acute flaccid myelitis or AFM, a polio-like disease that's struck hundreds of children since 2014.\n\nErin Olivera, mother of a child with AFM and founder of a private Facebook page for parents of 400 children with the disease, says Bailey's experience is hardly unique. She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad. It's very bad.\"\n\nBailey's story\n\nBailey was a healthy little girl until October 28, 2014, when she suddenly couldn't move her neck or her right shoulder or leg.\n\nA rehabilitation expert at a children's hospital said Bailey wasn't really paralyzed, according to her mother, Mikell Sheehan.\n\nThe doctor said the paralysis was an emotional reaction to her sister's birth four months earlier. He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis. That's true, he said, but doctors need to thoroughly test for physical problems before defaulting to a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n\"Physicians have an obligation to do a thorough workup before turning to a psychological explanation,\" he said. \"When a doctor can't find a cause, that's a great time to get a second opinion or consult with a specialist.\"\n\nFrances added that it's OK for a doctor to simply say \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Doctors need to learn to embrace medical uncertainty,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "More than 164,000 pounds of ground turkey recalled; 52 more people sick in deadly salmonella outbreak", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/iUvEUWRYf6A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales Inc. is recalling about 164,210 pounds of raw ground turkey products due to the possibility of salmonella contamination, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Friday .\n\nThe recall was announced as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 52 new cases of illness associated with the outbreak.

The recalled packages are marked on the side with establishment number P-579 and were sold in 1-pound, 2.5-pound and 3-pound packages.\n\nOn November 15 , the company issued a recall of more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products from its Barron, Wisconsin, facility.\n\nPatients who were interviewed by outbreak investigators reported buying a variety of different brands of raw turkey products from many different stores. \"A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified that could account for the whole outbreak,\" the CDC said.

This bacteria was \"closely related genetically\" to the bacteria from the patients. \"This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating turkey,\" the CDC said.\n\nLykken said, \"As always, turkey remains safe to consume when handled and prepared properly. Jennie-O has information available on its website with step-by-step instructions on how to safely prepare and enjoy turkey.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers should not eat any recalled products and should take steps to prevent salmonella illness. That includes washing hands and thoroughly cooking turkey to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as measured by a food thermometer.

We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015.

He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers.

It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise 02:34\n\nThe report wasn't all doom and gloom; it also had some positive findings.\n\n\"Childhood poverty has decreased,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That's a key indicator of somebody's socioeconomic status and a good predictor of how their overall health is going to be for the rest of their life. That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes. What we would like to see is all states improving.\"\n\nHopes for better health in the new year\n\nAs the nation looks toward 2019, Randall said, she has some hopes for public health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"What I hope we will see next year is that some of these trends really start to go in a better direction. As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report. That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year. We are concerned that there are firms whose actions could be putting patients at risk and might be subject to additional action.\"\n\nThe only FDA-approved use for these umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products is for hematopoietic or immunologic reconstitution, meaning for people with disorders that affect the part of the system involved in producing blood, the hematopoietic system. That can be for blood or bone marrow transplants in patients who have cancer or blood or immune system disorders.\n\nSome practitioners believe that stem cells can \"sense the environment into which they are introduced and address whatever functions require replacement or repair,\" FDA scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2017, but that \"is not based on scientific evidence.\" These stem cell treatments need to go through the appropriate clinical trials to prove that they work and are safe.\n\nThe FDA warned the public about the unapproved use of stem cell treatments in 2017, saying \"unscrupulous providers\" may promise that stem cells can be \"miracle treatments\" for just about any disease or medical condition, but not to believe \"the hype.\" At the time, Gottlieb called them \"dangerously dubious products.\"\n\nThe patients infected in this outbreak got the stem cell treatments for ailments that include general pain, osteoarthritis, back pain, a rotator cuff tear with a cyst and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAccording to Thursday's CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the first infections were reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services on September 17. Three people who got injections or infusions of umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products at a Texas outpatient clinic on September 12 developed bloodstream infections.\n\nOn September 22, the Florida Department of Health was notified that four people had joint infections after getting injections from a Florida orthopedic clinic between February 15 and August 30. When scientists looked at some of the unopened products at that clinic, they found E. coli and E. faecalis bacteria.\n\nThe report does not offer details on the patient in Arizona. Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product. Perkins credited the health departments in Texas and Florida with picking up on infections quickly.\n\nThe FDA urges health care professionals and consumers to report any adverse events related to treatments with Liveyon products, Genetech products or other stem cell treatments to its MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.\n\nGottlieb noted that the field is growing quickly. There's a lot of innovation and promise, and some companies have come in to work with the FDA, but others have \"ignored our request for dialogue,\" he said, and are \"putting patients at risk.\"\n\nHe said Thursday that dozens of firms are not taking the necessary steps to ensure patient safety."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link":

close to the last reported sighting, was being forensically examined.\n\nThe force acknowledged that its suggestion, made on Sunday, that there may never have been a drone at Gatwick was down to \"poor communications\".\n\nEarlier, Deputy Chief Constable Jo Shiner stated there were numerous illegal drone sightings at the airport over three days from 19 to 21 December, discounting any doubt over possible sightings.\n\nThere were more than 200 sightings since the first drone was spotted, with police taking 67 statements, including from fellow officers and airport staff.\n\n\"The impact of this criminal and reckless behaviour has been enormous and we are determined to locate those responsible to bring them to justice,\" she said.\n\nGatwick said it had taken the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers, and it was clear there were \"multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity\".\n\nAuthorities finally regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the

from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater.\n\nOn Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves.\n\nBut, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.\n\nHe confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012.\n\nGeologist Rapha\u00ebl Paris, whose 2012 study predicted the collapse of a flank of Anak Krakatau and a subsequent tsunami, said: \"There is a big uncertainty on the stability of the volcanic cone now, and the probability for future collapses and tsunamis is perhaps non-negligible.\"\n\nWhy was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?\n\nThe tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.\n\nSeawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.\n\nImage copyright Social media Image caption Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit\n\nThe waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing.\n\nMembers of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.\n\nHow did the tsunami happen?\n\nBy Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent\n\nEveryone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous.\n\nIn other words, it's been part of the background.\n\nAnd yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nThe first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions.\n\nHow common are tsunamis in Indonesia?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit\n\nIndonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.\n\nIn September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.\n\nKrakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)\n\nImage copyright Oystein Lund Andersen\n\nIn August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:\n\nMassive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people\n\nThousands more were killed by hot ash\n\nThe eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945\n\nThe eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away\n\nWorld temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year\n\nThe volcanic island virtually disappeared\n\nAre you in the affected area?

He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves.\n\nBut, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.\n\nHe confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012.\n\nGeologist Rapha\u00ebl Paris, whose 2012 study predicted the collapse of a flank of Anak Krakatau and a subsequent tsunami, said: \"There is a big uncertainty on the stability of the volcanic cone now, and the probability for future collapses and tsunamis is perhaps non-negligible.\"\n\nWhy was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?\n\nThe tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.\n\nSeawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.\n\nImage copyright Social media Image caption Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit\n\nThe waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing.\n\nMembers of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.\n\nHow did the tsunami happen?\n\nBy Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent\n\nEveryone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous.\n\nIn other words, it's been part of the background.\n\nAnd yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.\n\nThe first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions.\n\nHow common are tsunamis in Indonesia?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit\n\nIndonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.\n\nIn September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.\n\nOn 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.\n\nKrakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)\n\nImage copyright Oystein Lund Andersen\n\nIn August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:\n\nMassive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people\n\nThousands more were killed by hot ash\n\nThe eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945\n\nThe eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away\n\nWorld temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year\n\nThe volcanic island virtually disappeared\n\nAre you in the affected area?

procedure in Rome's north-western suburb of Monterondo and is recovering in hospital.\n\nA 66-year-old man has been charged with murder, according to Italian media.\n\nSome 5,000 circumcisions are performed in Italy each year but more than a third are carried out illegally, according to health charity Amsi.\n\nCultural non-profit group Arci said the procedures had taken place at a refugee centre it runs with the local council in Monterondo.\n\n\"It is a tragedy that leaves us speechless,\" Arci said in a statement on Facebook, adding that it would take civil action once those responsible for the child's death had been determined by police.\n\nThe two boys, who have not been named, were born in Italy in 2017 to a Nigerian mother who has five other children in

being questioned by police.\n\nAnsa said the man arrested was an American citizen of Libyan origin.\n\n\"It is an absurd tragedy,\" said Antonino Lupi, mayor of Monterondo, in an interview with the Corriere Della Sera.\n\nCircumcision is currently unavailable in public health institutions in Italy.\n\nHaving the procedure at a private clinic can cost between \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,798) and \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,596), according to Foad Aodi, president of Amsi.\n\nAs a result, those from poorer backgrounds can \"end up in the hands of unscrupulous and unskilled people, who for \u20ac50 or \u20ac20 practise circumcision,\" Mr Aodi said in a statement.\n\nIs circumcision safe?\n\nBy Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor\n\nAlthough it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk free.\n\nDoctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis.\n\nThere is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners.\n\nIt is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV.\n\nThe main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection.\n\nIn the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50, according to the NHS website, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not newborns.\n\nHow do other European countries compare?\n\nCircumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial.\n\nA court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it \"permanently and irreparably changed\" the body.\n\nHowever, the German government later that year clarified that the procedure is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners.\n\nThe following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision.\n\nAnd in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Gatwick drone arrest couple feel 'completely violated'", "article_link":

What's pushing us to go to Mars?\" he said, adding \"I don't think the public is that interested\".\n\nMeanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars. Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia.\n\nIn a statement, Nasa said it was \"leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars\".\n\n\"That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept.\n\nIn December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon.\n\nThe crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth.\n\nThey splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown.\n\nIt was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later.\n\nBut the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The famous Earthrise image taken from Apollo 8\n\n\"Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today.

It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,\" he said.\n\n\"The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings.\"\n\nIt's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community.\n\n\"I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify.

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "The Week In Pictures \u2013 Week Of December 24, 2018", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/the-week-in-pictures-week-of-december-24-2018-1831266621", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "Sports\n\nStudy: Most Concussions Can Be Prevented By Wearing Second Helmet"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Study: Most Concussions Can Be Prevented By Wearing Second Helmet", "article_link": "https://sports.theonion.com/study-most-concussions-can-be-prevented-by-wearing-sec-1831266194", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

Her daughter Anisa washed ashore in Sukaraja village about a kilometre-and-a-half away the next day,\" Abdulrahman told Al Jazeera on Monday.\n\n\"They were reunited at the local hospital and buried together yesterday.\"\n\n'No chance of many survivors'\n\nThe area along the coastline around the districts of Kalianda and Rajabasa bore the brunt of the tsunami that hit Sumatra.\n\nHundreds of homes and business have been washed away - destroying the livelihoods of many locals in the process.\n\nMedi Herlianto, director of emergency facilities at BNPB, flew in by helicopter from the capital, Jakarta, on Sunday to assess the damage along the coastline in South Lampung.\n\nThe agency has not finished compiling data, but in South Lampung alone, at least 58 people have been found dead, 250 injured and eight are still missing and presumed dead.\n\n\"There is no chance that there are any more survivors at this point,\" Herlianto told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Our goal now is to work with the local government to provide humanitarian aid and help with the evacuation process,\" he said, adding that some 1,000 people in South Lampung were displaced.\n\nArinal Djunaidi, the incoming governor of Lampung, told Al Jazeera that he is committed to helping the survivors of the ruinous tsunami.\n\n\"We need to help them get back to their daily lives as soon as possible and start the cleanup process. We have brought in 13 excavators to help move the debris and have already cleared the main roads to the villages in the area,\" he said.\n\n'Volcano's rumbling noise getting louder'\n\nLocal residents such as Abdulrahman are also providing assistance on the ground. In Rajabasa village, a command post has been set up to distribute food and clothing donations from residents in neighbouring areas.\n\nFor now, the post is run only by men. Women, children and the elderly have been moved to temporary shelters on higher ground in case of another tsunami.\n\nExperts have warned that if Anak Krakatoa continues to erupt, it could trigger more underwater landslides and more deadly waves.\n\nFor Abdulrahman, who has lived in Rajabasa village all his life, the fear is real.\n\n\"We can see the volcano from here but it usually just glows like the tip of a cigarette,\" he said. \"But over the last few days, the light from the eruptions has been glowing brighter and the rumbling noise from the volcano has been getting louder.\"\n\nAbdulrahman and groups of male residents from Rajabasa village have been keeping watch around 10 meters away from the shoreline to guard the homes that are still standing and have now been vacated.\n\nHe said that many of the volunteers are afraid but are trying to remain sanguine.\n\n\"We feel calm knowing that our wives and children are safe on higher ground,\" Abdulrahman said.\n\n\"Of course we're scared that another tsunami could hit our village of any time, but we grew up here and our ancestors always told us that Krakatoa was a threat on the horizon.\n\n\"We're scared, but this is our home.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Head of UN ceasefire monitor visits Yemen's Hodeidah

retired Dutch general, called on Yemen's Saudi-backed government forces and Houthi rebels to respect the hard-won truce, Yehya Sharafeddin, Hodeidah port deputy director, said on Monday.\n\n\"The [UN] official promised us that the war will end,\" Sharafeddin told AFP news agency by phone after Cammaert visited the docks, through which the majority of imports and humanitarian aid enter Yemen.\n\n\"He said the Yemen war had been forgotten for years, but that the international community is now adamant about ending it,\" he said.\n\nCammaert is heading a joint committee, which includes members of the government and the Houthi rebels, in charge of monitoring the truce in Hodeidah and its surroundings that began on December 18.\n\nCammaert arrived in the Red Sea city from the rebel-held capital Sanaa, after meeting with government officials in Aden.\n\nYemen's warring sides agreed on the ceasefire to halt a devastating offensive by government forces and an allied Saudi-led coalition against rebel-held Hodeidah at peace talks in Sweden this month.\n\nAccording to the UN, Cammaert will chair a meeting of the joint committee on Wednesday.\n\nThat meeting will be \"one of the priorities\" of Cammaert's mission, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Sunday.\n\n\"General Cammaert is encouraged by the general enthusiasm of both sides to get to work, immediately,\" he

importance of implementing the agreement\" and will visit \"battlefronts [in the city] at a later time\".\n\nShaky truce\n\nThe ceasefire, the result of intense diplomatic efforts led by the UN, has remained shaky, with both sides accusing each other of violations in Hodeidah province.\n\nCoalition spokesman Turki al-Maliki said on Monday that the Houthi rebels have violated the truce agreement 138 times since it came into effect.\n\nThe latest Security Council resolution on Yemen \"puts the Houthi militias under international pressure\", he said during a press conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh.\n\nThe UN monitoring team aims to secure the functioning of Hodeidah port and supervise the withdrawal of fighters from the city.\n\nThe text approved by the Security Council \"insists on the full respect by all parties of the ceasefire agreed\" for Hodeidah.\n\nIt authorises the UN to \"establish and deploy, for an initial period of 30 days from the adoption of this resolution, an advance team to begin monitoring\" the ceasefire, under Cammaert's leadership.\n\nAbout 10,000 people have been killed since the coalition intervened in 2015, according to the World Health Organization, although rights groups say the death toll could be five times higher.\n\nThe conflict has unleashed a major humanitarian crisis and pushed 14 million Yemenis to the brink of famine."},

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The central bank kept rates low for several years.\n\nEventually, growth recovered, and unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 49 years, and Fed officials judged that the emergency stimulus was no longer needed. Fed leaders voted to reduce the stimulus by raising interest rates gradually. The concern was that too much stimulus could spark inflation. Experts say such a sharp increase in prices could prompt a damaging cycle of price increases leading to rising wage demands, which would spark another round of price hikes.\n\nAnalysts quoted in the financial press say Trump's attacks on the Fed make investors worry that the central bank might lose the independence that allows it to make decisions based on economic factors rather than what is politically popular.\n\nSome economists say investor confidence has also been shaken by Trump's tariffs on major trading partners. Raising trade costs can reduce trade and cutting trade cuts demand for goods and services, which slows economic growth.\n\nInvestor confidence, or a lack of it, can cause stock and other markets to decline as worried stock holders sell shares and prospective investors stop buying available stocks.

In the Philippines a month later, Mattis swore to uphold a decades-old military alliance that helps Manila resist China. A U.S. naval ship passes through the South China Sea every couple of months or so as support for keeping the resource-rich waterway open, not just for Chinese use.\n\nMoments like these raised Southeast Asia\u2019s confidence in U.S. support after some nervousness when President Donald Trump took office in 2017. Mattis will quit January 1, in turn shaking that confidence.\n\nBeijing has drilled for oil, built up islands or passed ships in South China Sea waters claimed as well by Vietnam, the Philippines and three other Asian governments. Weaker than China, the Southeast Asian states hoped the United States would help. Mattis advocated close relations with allies to resist authoritarian states.\n\n\u201cI suspect many leaders, be they in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, will just roll their eyes and think, \u2018here we go again\u2019\u201d after Mattis leaves, said Sean King, vice president of the Park Strategies political consultancy in New York. \u201cMattis is different, as he\u2026holds such a critical life-and-death cabinet post and is a firm believer in America's alliances, as evidenced in his resignation letter to Trump.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Asia alliance spans democracies from Japan through South Korea and Taiwan into Southeast Asia. Many of those countries are trying to pare back the influence of China.\n\nSudden resignation\n\n\u201cIt is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model \u2014 gaining veto authority over other nations\u2019 economic, diplomatic, and security decisions \u2014 to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies,\u201d the 68-year-old ex-Marine Corps general wrote in his resignation letter to Trump.\n\n\u201cThat is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense,\u201d the December 20 letter says.\n\nAsian leaders found \u201creliability\u201d in Mattis\u2019s ties with Asia, said Huang Kwei-bo, vice dean of the international affairs college at National Chengchi University in Taipei. The defense secretary made a particular impression by attending the Shangri-la Dialogue twice, telling Asia\u2019s major annual defense summit in 2018 that the U.S. government would help its \u201cpartners\u201d improve protection of their maritime interests.\n\nVietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan dispute Chinese expansion in the resource-rich South China Sea. Taiwan and Japan vie with Beijing separately over control of the East China Sea.\n\n\u201cHe played a sort of force of reliability because at least as defense chief he did what he said and then when he made contact with every other country he was steady, giving them a sense of reliability, so other people\u2019s trust in the United States won\u2019t fall so fast,\u201d Huang said.\n\nMattis quit a day after Trump announced the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria, a move opposed by the defense department. European allies France, Sweden and the U.K. have already voiced concern about the resignation.\n\nAmong countries that claim the South China Sea, Vietnam will probably \u201cmiss\u201d Mattis the most, King said. Vietnam has stood firmest against Beijing, he said, while other Asian maritime claimants look to the United States for security but to China for economic support.\n\nWait-and-watch phase\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Syria could show that Trump and his eventual new defense chief will later isolate Washington from its Asian allies, King said.

He accused Fed chief Jerome Powell of not understanding the market and damaging the economy with rate hikes.\n\nThe Fed slashed the key interest rate nearly to zero to boost growth during the recession that started in 2007. The central bank kept rates low for several years.\n\nEventually, growth recovered, and unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 49 years, and Fed officials judged that the emergency stimulus was no longer needed. Fed leaders voted to reduce the stimulus by raising interest rates gradually. The concern was that too much stimulus could spark inflation. Experts say such a sharp increase in prices could prompt a damaging cycle of price increases leading to rising wage demands, which would spark another round of price hikes.\n\nAnalysts quoted in the financial press say Trump's attacks on the Fed make investors worry that the central bank might lose the independence that allows it to make decisions based on economic factors rather than what is politically popular.\n\nSome economists say investor confidence has also been shaken by Trump's tariffs on major trading partners. Raising trade costs can reduce trade and cutting trade cuts demand for goods and services, which slows economic growth.\n\nInvestor confidence, or a lack of it, can cause stock and other markets to decline as worried stock holders sell shares and prospective investors stop buying available stocks. When buyer demand drops, prices fall.\n\nAnother factor hurting investor confidence is the political impasse in Washington over money for Trump's border wall with Mexico.

The feature \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d by Mimi Leder, another female filmmaker, offers a dramatized portayal of the beginnings of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s illustrious career and her fight for women\u2019s rights, through the lens of her personal life and marriage.\n\nLeder's film follows Justice Ginsburg\u2019s challenges in a man\u2019s world, starting with her first year as a law student at Harvard, in 1954. She was one of nine female students among more than 500 men, a situation that did not please the law school's dean, played by Sam Waterston. The film shows him demanding to know why they are occupying seats that could have otherwise gone to young men.\n\n\u201cOn the Basis of Sex\" also looks into Ginsburg\u2019s private life as a wife and mother. At some point she was supporting her convalescent husband, who had suffered testicular cancer, by attending both her classes and his.\n\n\u200bDaniel Stiepleman, the film\u2019s screenwriter, is Justice Ginsburg\u2019s nephew. He told VOA that apart from her legal acumen and advocacy for women\u2019s rights, he wanted to share his first-hand experience of Ginsburg\u2019s equal partnership with her husband, renowned tax law attorney, Martin Ginsburg.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have always looked up to aunt Ruth and uncle Marty as our role models for what a marriage is supposed to be like,\" he explained. \"They shared the load raising their kids, getting food on the table, and taking care of the house, and we knew that that\u2019s how we wanted to be as well. And so, for me, this was an opportunity to share our good fortune to have them as role models with the rest of the country, the rest of the world.\"\n\nActor Armie Hammer interprets Martin Ginsburg. He says he felt privileged to learn about the man's character from Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself. \"We were very lucky to have time with Justice Ginsburg in her private chambers in the Supreme Court. She invited us in and she was very generous with her time. More than actually answering any of my questions, I learned everything I needed to know about the relationship, [because] the minute his name came up she started smiling. And I could feel that love was very much alive.\u201d Hammer predicts the film will inspire audiences, especially women during the #MeToo era. \"I think it is great for women to see a movie about a woman who changed the world without needing superpowers.\u201d\n\nGinsburg herself is portrayed by Felicity Jones. It was a role she found, to say the least, challenging. She told VOA, \u201cIt was nerve wracking! You don\u2019t enter into that lightly so it was about becoming her in every single way and doing justice to her story.\u201d She also says that though the events surrounding Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life have been dramatized for the sake of entertaiment, they speak truth to power. \"It is so important that it does entertain but at the same time, it\u2019s about getting a message into this world and about saying \u2018look what men and women can achieve when they work together, when they have absolute equality.'\u201d\n\nThe documentary \u201cRBG,\u201d by Julie Cohen and Betsy West, chronicles Justice Ginsburg\u2019s life from her birth to an immigrant Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, to her rise as a pop culture icon after publications and websites coined her as \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d In between were legal victories for gender equality in arguments before the Supreme Court, and her appointment as a Justice in 1993, becoming the second woman on the Court.\n\n\u201cI am 84 years old and everybody wants to take a picture with me,\u201d says a mischevious Justice Ginsburg. She has been hailed as a pioneer for gender equality, a tenacious Supreme Court Justice, determined to work as long as she can make a difference on the bench. In 2011, a year after the death of her husband, Justice Ginsburg spoke with VOA\u2019s Julie Taboh about her legacy. \u201cI hope that I will be remembered as someone who loves the law, loves her country, loved humanity, prizes the dignity of every individual, and works as hard as she can, with whatever talent she has to make the world a little better than it was when I entered it,\u201d she said.\n\nHer dedication for justice and rule of law gave rise to a huge following. Her\n\nas well as merchandise featuring her picture in her iconic Supreme Court robe and lace collar. Chocolatier Sue Cassidy says her company, Choukette, has dedicated a chocolate box to Ginsburg as part of its Phenomenal Women chocolate line. \"She has her own box, and we can\u2019t keep them in stock. They are just selling like crazy.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg has spoken highly of both films depicting her life. Filmmaker Mimi Leder says that the Justice offered advice for \u201cOn the Basis of Sex\u201d and fact-checked it. \u201cShe saw the film and she gave me a hug and a kiss, and that alone was incredible. I feel that women will be inspired not just in this country, but all over the world by the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which is her fight for equality, inclusion, her fight against injustice.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Departing Senators Decry America's Toxic Political Discourse", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4713600.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "From Capitol Hill, a blunt message: America's political discourse is broken, threatening the nation's wellbeing and possibly democracy itself.

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones. It wasn't clear what brand was used in the Gatwick incident.\n\nBritish authorities are planning to tighten regulations by requiring drone users to register, which could make it easier to identify the pilot. U.S. law already requires users to register their drones and get certified as pilots.\n\nBut Wagner warned: \"If somebody wants to do something really bad, he will never register.\""}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Ancient Horse Found Still Harnessed Near Ruins Of Pompeii", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pompeii-petrified-horse-found_us_5c20e2a7e4b05c88b6fb1309", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Evidence of 2,000-year-old horses near the ancient ruins of Pompeii has been uncovered by archaeologists in Italy.\n\nExcavations at an estate\u2019s stable near present-day Naples uncovered the horses.

And a conversation with Erdogan on Dec. 14 was central to Trump\u2019s Syria move, The Associated Press reported, after Erdogan asked why U.S. forces still needed to be in the country, given the success of efforts against the ISIS insurgency there. Trump\u2019s sudden agreement on that point caught Erdogan \u201coff guard,\u201d according to the AP, and Trump quickly directed top aides to start arranging a drawback \u2015 a policy shift that almost no one in his national security circle supported and that led to the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and top State Department official Brett McGurk.\n\nIt\u2019s true that bombing and ground support for local partners by the U.S. and allies since 2014 has drastically shrunk the ISIS presence, which mushroomed amid Syria\u2019s civil war. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s political rise and presidency have been associated with politically popular criticism of U.S. intervention abroad \u2015 this is something he can say he has delivered on to his voters \u2015 and he has received some praise for the decision from detractors of the national security establishment like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nBut critics of the decision have gained traction by highlighting the rushed way it seems to have been made over the objections of Trump\u2019s advisers, and the Sunday message helps them by suggesting that he is to at least degree being guided by his long-running fixation with strongmen. Using \u201cstrongly\u201d and saying Erdogan \u201cis a man who can do it\u201d echoes Trump\u2019s previous niceties about the Turkish president, who has jailed dozens of journalists, and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2015 and hints more at a feeling than a sober national security assessment.\n\nFrom a strategic viewpoint, betting on Erdogan in such a big way is risky. His priorities in Syria don\u2019t neatly align with those of the U.S.: While Washington prioritized weakening ISIS, he helped with that fight but was largely fixated on Kurdish militants who also became stronger as Syria fell into chaos. American policymakers have been supporting the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, which Erdogan dislikes and is ideologically linked to a rebel group that has battled the Turkish government for decades. For him, taking on a larger role in Syria will likely mean trying to curtail the Kurds\u2019 power.\n\nAdditionally, Erdogan\u2019s past relationship with ISIS is murky. While his government has targeted by the group and has cracked down on its networks in Turkey, for years it turned a blind eye to the flow of fighters and money to extremist groups involved in the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom Erdogan wanted to see ousted.\n\nThe Turkish leader has softened on Assad but continues to support fighters in Syria who may have turned on the formerly U.S.-backed Kurds. And in the course of adjusting his Syria policy and dealing with other issues like Western criticism of his record on human rights, Erdogan has grown closer and closer to Putin \u2015 a problem for the leader of a NATO member country and another reason U.S. officials are wary of fully following the Turkish lead.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest message will likely only fuel a controversy that now has even commentators close to his administration publicly fretting."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Pakistan's Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Sentenced To 7 Years For Corruption", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pakistans-former-prime-minister-sharif-sentenced-to-7-years-for-corruption_us_5c20c85ce4b0407e907d3e50", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif arrives to appear in a court in Lahore, Pakistan, on Oct. 8, 2018.\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 An anti-graft tribunal sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to seven years in prison for corruption on Monday, drawing criticism from his party, which said the decision was a \u201cblack spot\u201d on the justice system.\n\nThe verdict came after Sharif was removed from power last year over corruption allegations.

It has been erupting since June and did so again about 24 minutes before the tsunami, the geophysics agency said.\n\nThe volcanic island formed over years after the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, one of the largest, most devastating in recorded history. That disaster killed more than 30,000 people, launched far-reaching tsunamis and created so much ash that day was turned to night in the area and a global temperature drop was recorded.\n\nMost of the island sank into a volcanic crater under the sea, and the area remained calm until the 1920s, when Anak Krakatau began to rise from the site.

Voters rejected the citizen initiative last month, 53 to 47 percent. Three other red states passed similar measures the same day.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nPerhaps the chief takeaway from the rejected citizen initiative to expand Medicaid in Montana last month is this: Be careful when you poke a giant.\n\nMontana was one of four red states with Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and the only one where it failed. And the reason why, many close observers both inside and outside of the state agree, almost certainly came down to a tactical decision to link expansion to an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax.\n\nSupporters thought that strategy would boost their effort with voters, but it attracted Big Tobacco into the fight, along with the $17.2 million it spent, much of it on a television advertising blitz. Opponents raised nearly $19 million to defeat the measure, finance reports filed with the state show.\n\nProponents, with about $9.7 million to spend, simply couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\n\u201cIt was impossible with the money we had to compete,\u201d said one of the leaders of the coalition, who spoke with Stateline but asked not to be named because the coalition has not yet publicly addressed what went wrong. The tobacco interests \u201cgot too far ahead with their messaging.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, this activist said, it may have been a mistake to combine Medicaid expansion and a tax that targeted a deep-pocketed opposition.\n\nThe tobacco industry went nowhere near the other states where Medicaid expanding initiatives appeared on November\u2019s ballot: Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Medicaid expansion plans passed comfortably in those states, but the Montana version fell decisively, 53 to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cThe basic lesson is that if you create a big political target, don\u2019t be surprised if people pay attention to it,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIf you propose to raise tobacco taxes, don\u2019t be surprised if tobacco pushes all its chips in. The same happens when you try to raise soda taxes.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is a government-supported health insurance for the poor, and each state has an option to expand that program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAdam Searing, an associate professor at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, noted that the only difference between Montana and the three other states was the inclusion of a specific tax in the Montana initiative. That inclusion diluted the central message of the ballot measure, he added.\n\n\u201cBasically it seems the more you focus on that central issue of expanding affordable health care to more working class people, the more successful you are likely to be,\u201d Searing said of the success in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that advocates in other non-expansion states might want to take to heart as they continue their fight \u2014 which they are vowing to do, despite the ruling earlier this month by a federal judge in Texas that the entire ACA, including the Medicaid expansion provision, is unconstitutional.\n\nMany legal analysts on both the left and the right say the decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in a lawsuit brought by Republican governors and attorneys general from 20 states is unlikely to stand. In any case, the ACA will remain in place while the ruling makes its way through the appellate courts, perhaps ending up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fairness Project, an advocacy group that reportedly spent $6 million in support of the initiatives in November, names Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming as states where Medicaid expansion initiatives could reach the ballot in 2020. Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the project, said the ruling in Texas hasn\u2019t dampened the group\u2019s conviction that most Americans support expansion.\n\nIn a tracking poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation the week after the midterm elections, 59 percent of voters in non-expansion states said they favored expansion.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid already had been expanded by law in 2016 to include any adult with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line. In 2018, that translates to $16,753 for an individual. Before the expansion, only Montana low-income adults who were caregivers, pregnant or disabled qualified for Medicaid.\n\nBut that 2016 expansion had been set to expire in July 2019. The ballot proposal last month, Initiative 185, would have made the Medicaid expansion permanent. (The other three states will see expansion for the first time.)\n\nNow it will be up to the Republican-controlled legislature to determine the future of the expansion in Montana, a high priority for popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C., have adopted Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nExpansion proponents in the Treasure State think their losing campaign this fall, which entailed a grassroots operation, will pay off with a legislative victory in the winter.\n\nThe pro-expansion campaign, said Jessica Rhoades, Bullock\u2019s health policy adviser, \u201ccreated a volunteer network of very motivated nurses and doctors who can go into the legislative session with a strong base of support behind them.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming Montana House speaker, said court ruling in Texas is worth paying attention to, but it won\u2019t halt work in Montana to craft a Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s financially sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re still forging ahead,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nThe legislative session begins Jan. 7, and lawmakers already are crafting bills in preparation for upcoming hearings, Hertz said. Republicans are interested in cost-control measures that could include performance audits and work requirements for single, able-bodied adults, he said.\n\nMontana Senate President Scott Sales, also a Republican, agreed that expansion proponents will still have the votes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d spoken to me a few days before the court ruling, I\u2019d say Medicaid expansion is going to pass in some form; I think that\u2019s still the case,\u201d Sales said.\n\nFinancial mismatch\n\nThe $19 million raised in opposition to the campaign, 91 percent of it from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, is more than twice the amount spent on Montana ballot measures since at least 2006, data compiled by FollowTheMoney showed. The nonprofit, which tracks campaign spending, found it was also more than $7 million above the amount spent by all candidates in the last Montana gubernatorial election, in 2016.\n\nSupporters of Initiative 185 raised $9.7 million, also more than previous Montana ballot measures. That coalition \u2014 Healthy Montana for I-185 \u2014 included groups representing hospitals and health care providers in the state as well as advocacy groups representing the poor, retired people and labor unions. It also included state chapters of national organizations that support efforts to end diseases, such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\n\nProponents say the financial mismatch doomed the initiative even as pre-election polls had shown voters evenly divided on the measure. Montana State University, for example, reported in late October that 41.4 percent of Montana voters were in favor of expansion versus 40.8 percent against, with a 2 point margin of error.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this article, Chuck Denowh, the spokesman for Montanans Against Tax Hikes \u2014 created for the Medicaid campaign \u2014 and president of the Montana Group, a Helena political and public relationship consulting firm, said he was on a family vacation and couldn\u2019t respond. He did not respond to a request to designate someone else with the organization. Altria did not respond by deadline to a request for an interview.\n\nOther factors besides big spending by tobacco may have contributed to the loss.\n\nThe ballot language began with a description of the tax increase, and that didn\u2019t help, said Jesse Cross-Call of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy and research think tank in Washington. \u201cUnless you were intimately aware of it before going into the voting booth, it was hard to know what was at stake. It looked like the initiative was about raising taxes rather than extending health care to more people.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s measure proposed a general sales tax increase and the initiatives in Idaho and Nebraska left it up to the legislature to decide how to pay for the expansion.\n\nBut, according to Rhoades, early polling suggested that linking a tobacco tax to expansion would improve its chances. That doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case.\n\nCoalition members pushed for the tobacco increase not only as a source of financing for the expansion, but also as a discouragement to smoking, which itself, Healthy Montana claimed, costs Montanans $440 million in health care every year.\n\nThe initiative would have increased the tobacco tax by $2 for a pack of 20 cigarettes. It also would have increased taxes on snuff and created a tax on vaping.\n\nFewer uninsured in Montana\n\nBy March of this year, Montana\u2019s Medicaid had extended benefits to 94,000 newly eligible beneficiaries, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. Bullock\u2019s office said expansion, along with other elements of the Affordable Care Act, reduced the uninsured rate in the state from 15 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent today.\n\nIn its economic analysis, the university report said expansion has injected $350 million to $400 million of new spending into the state each year. That money has generated about 5,000 new jobs and will produce about $270 million in personal income in each year between 2018 and 2020, the report found.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs, with its portion gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. That\u2019s compared with 65.5 percent for traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe proponents of Initiative 185 said the increased tobacco taxes, which they estimated would\u2019ve raised an additional $74 million a year by 2023, would pay for that extra 10 percent.\n\nThe university report estimated that after 2020, when the federal match drops to 90 percent, the increased state tax revenue from the economic activity generated by the expansion would be enough to cover the state\u2019s expansion costs without raising taxes or creating new ones.\n\nThat is the position Bullock has taken in urging the legislature to pass expansion next year. The governor\u2019s proposal does not call for an increase in tobacco taxes but would include a small increase in taxes on medical providers.\n\nBut that was not the message of the initiative\u2019s opponents, who ran ads claiming \u2014 falsely, proponents say \u2014 that the proposed tobacco increase would not cover expansion costs. All Montanans would end up footing the bill, their ads proclaimed.\n\nThe looming question, of course, is what will happen in the legislature. Some of those who led the campaign for expansion have told Stateline they are pessimistic, fearing legislators who are inclined to vote against can now point to the election results to justify a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nCasey Schreiner, the incoming House minority leader and supporter of expansion, said he wasn\u2019t overly worried.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the legislature sees the benefit of taking the sunset off,\u201d the Democrat told Stateline, referring to the July 2019 expiration of the current Medicaid expansion plan. \u201cEverybody understands what happened, that a large amount of money got dumped into Montana and the initiative was mischaracterized as a tax increase rather than expanding health care."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Mindy Kaling's Punny Christmas Decorations Add Holiday Sparkle To Dad Jokes", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mindy-kalings-punny-christmas-decorations-are-a-perfect-dad-joke_us_5c20e14ce4b08aaf7a8b2d78", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Mindy Kaling is having a punderful Christmas.\n\nThe \u201cOceans 8\u201d actress injected just the right amount of dad-joke into her holidays, and incorporated some celebrity names into puns for her decorations.\n\nShe\u2019s got a Ginger-Fred Armisen ornament, a Judy Garland lining her staircase, Matthew McConau-Tree, a Margaret Cho-flake, and more.\n\nKaling\u2019s puns make us cringe \u2015 in the best way."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Donald Trump, Walled Off From Reality", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-donald-trump-government-shutdown_us_5c205647e4b0407e907c89a7", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "What will it take for Republicans in Congress to conclude that President Donald Trump has outlived his political usefulness to them, and is dangerously unglued? We may soon find out.\n\nIn one ring of the circus, Trump abruptly decided to pull all U.S. forces out of Syria. This prompted the resignation of both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and anti-ISIS coalition envoy Brett McGurk.\n\nThese guys, unlike many other former Trump appointees, didn\u2019t get fired by tweet. They quit in principled protest, something all too rare in American public life. McGurk sent an email to his staff, declaring: \u201cThe recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us. It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reversal also prompted much sharper criticism than usual from his slavish Senate allies. Lindsey Graham, ordinarily a Trump toady, told Vice President Mike Pence: \u201cIf Obama had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it\u2019s such a bad idea. The job of the Congress is to hold the executive branch accountable. He\u2019s the commander in chief, but he needs to be held accountable for his decisions. And I want hearings as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida called Trump\u2019s pullout \u201ca major mistake,\u201d and Ben Sasse of Nebraska declared that America\u2019s generals believe that \u201cthe high-fiving winners today are Iran, ISIS and Hezbollah.\u201d Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was appalled and said so. The usually docile McConnell issued a lengthy statement breaking with Trump:\n\nIt\u2019s essential that the United States maintain and strengthen the post-World War II alliances that have been carefully built by leaders in both parties. We must also maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes, and recognize that nations like Russia are among the latter.\u201d So I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis, who shares those clear principles, will soon depart the administration. But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America\u2019s global leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, in another ring of the circus, Trump shut down the government over Christmas. This undercut Republican leadership, which had a deal with Democrats for a temporary resolution to keep the government funded until the New Year.\n\nBut Trump, goaded by commentators on Fox News, reversed course over funding for his promised \u201cbig. beautiful wall.\u201d In his deluded state, Trump still thinks the idea of a border wall to be built at a cost of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars along our southern border is hugely popular. In fact, it\u2019s only popular with his hard-core base and far-right pundits.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTrump seems to have an edifice complex about the wall. It\u2019s become a vanity project, like Trump Tower, or Mar-a-Lago, or the aborted Putin Penthouse in Moscow.\n\nHe insists that a big wall is the best way to keep people out. In fact, most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. do not sneak across America\u2019s southern border. They overstay student, tourist or work visas.\n\nWith the new Congress, Democrats in the House simply will not agree to fund Trump\u2019s proposed erection. And public opinion is with them.\n\nYou might think \u2015 between the Syria withdrawal, the shutdown mess, and the fact that Trump has now managed to fire or drive out virtually all of his adult minders \u2015 that Republicans have had enough. But that remains to be seen.\n\nHouse Republicans, humiliated as they were by Trump\u2019s abrupt reversal, dutifully assembled to pass a budget resolution on Friday that included funding for Trump\u2019s wall. To no one\u2019s surprise, the measure died in the Senate.\n\nTrump seems happiest when there are no adults in the room to contain his impulses. As he put it in an interview with The Washington Post, \u201cI have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\u2019s brain can ever tell me.\u201d\n\nBut often, his gut is dead wrong. Trump has now increasingly become a rogue president, as retired 4-star Gen. Barry McCaffrey told The Washington Post. The more that the Mueller investigation\u2019s waters rise around him, the more reckless he becomes.\n\nSo where, finally, are the Republicans? Are they starting to connect the dots between Trump\u2019s disastrous, impulsive foreign policy moves, his budgetary antics and his unhinged personality? Are they, perhaps, worried for their country?\n\nRepublicans in Congress may conclude they need to reign in Trump, based on one of three considerations. First, his policies are doing serious damage to the national interest. Second, he is a madman. Third, he is humiliating them politically and has become a partisan liability.\n\nAlas, the first two considerations have been all too evident since before Trump took office. But in his first two years, Trump was too convenient an ally for Republicans to have acted.\n\nNow that Trump has cost Republicans the House and promises further political embarrassment, let\u2019s hope that sheer expedience gets their attention where principled concern for the republic failed.\n\n\n\n"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Bloomberg Rips 'Senselessly Chaotic' Trump, Demands GOP 'Start Showing Some Spine'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-bloomberg-trump_us_5c20aac0e4b05c88b6fabd4f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Bloomberg, in a blistering op-ed for his namesake media company, eviscerated President Donald Trump for the federal government shutdown and called the budget standoff a \u201cdumb\u201d way to demand border wall funding.\n\nThe former New York mayor\u2019s column, published on Sunday, said the partial shutdown of the U.S. government shows Trump\u2019s administration is unraveling.\n\nBloomberg wrote that his major concerns include the potential for an economic nosedive triggered by what he described as Trump\u2019s devil-may-care style of leadership.\n\n\u201cWith other countries pleading for sanity and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization warning of severe consequences if trade sanctions get out of hand, talk of a looming recession is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cYet the president seems determined to make matters worse \u2014 and to hell with the economic consequences.\u201d\n\nBloomberg pointed to last week\u2019s stock market plunge as another sign that \u201cTrump\u2019s recklessly emotional and senselessly chaotic approach to the job\u201d has a real impact.\n\n\u201cAt the halfway mark of this terrible presidency, one has to wonder how much more the country can take,\u201d he added.\n\nThe only solution, Bloomberg said, was for the GOP to stand up to Trump.\n\n\u201cUnless something changes \u2014 unless, in particular, Republicans in Congress start showing some spine \u2014 two more years might be enough to test whether we can sustain Trump\u2019s model of bad government.

Is the new guy in charge a creep?\n\nBut as the Me Too movement heightens the expectations for political candidates and their campaigns, another much more powerful set of people has begun to do the asking: top aides to the many Democrats considering running for president in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to ask those questions very, very directly, in ways where, previously, you\u2019ve maybe just hinted at it,\u201d said a senior staff member to a potential 2020 candidate. \u201cNow you\u2019re stabbing right at it. It\u2019s a complete cultural change.\u201d\n\nThe staffer and other senior aides to potential 2020 Democratic candidates spoke on condition of anonymity because the campaigns they are discussing haven\u2019t officially launched. But behind the scenes, they said, the campaigns-in-waiting are undertaking a never-before-seen effort to screen prospective hires for a history of harassment or sexual misconduct.\n\nThis new effort shows how the Me Too movement against workplace sexual harassment has altered expectations for political candidates and their campaigns. For 14 months, the cascade of truth-telling about sexual harassment in politics and other industries has ended careers, prompted new workplace protections, and emboldened questions about whether candidates for office are living their stated ideals. Countless stories have exposed how the campaign trail can be a dangerous or alienating place, where the drive to win overwhelms concerns about people\u2019s safety from sexual assault and racism.\n\nAnd that was in the off-season. The 2020 race will be the first presidential contest fought on this changed political landscape, with all of the intense scrutiny that a presidential campaign entails. For Democrats, likely to engage in the most crowded primary brawl in decades, the stakes are even higher, aides and activists said.\n\nWeeding Out Hypocrisy\n\nThe Democratic primary may include candidates like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), who have championed reforms to sexual harassment laws and drawn a hard line against public figures accused of misconduct, including former Sen. Al Franken, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump. That invites scrutiny of every Democratic campaign for evidence that the party\u2019s contenders are practicing its principles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a signal, right? Your campaign structures signal your policies,\u201d one progressive activist said. \u201cNow you have another criteria: How do you demonstrate that you believe women, via your campaign structure?\u201d\n\nOne close aide to a possible 2020 contender said their camp is asking nearly everyone auditioning for a top role to disclose any past complaints about workplace behavior. Another said she is performing a battery of \u201csoft background checks\u201d by placing calls to activists \u2014 mostly women \u2014 who serve as the informal nerve center for whisper networks.\n\n\u201cAny campaign will have to ask these questions, for sure,\u201d another senior aide to a potential 2020 candidate said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just because of a fear that someone is going to get \u2018caught.\u2019 I think that they know it\u2019s important to ask what constitutes a workplace that is inviting.\u201d\n\n\u2018Finally\u2019\n\nRebecca Katz, a progressive strategist, is fielding a related set of inquiries: \u201cSend me resumes of competent people that aren\u2019t just white guys.\u201d\n\nCampaigns are sincerely seeking women and people of color for positions of power, Katz said.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that campaigns wanted to look a certain way on the outside, but internally it was still the white boys in charge of the work,\u201d Katz said. \u201cAnd that is changing fast. \u2026 I\u2019ve been in this business for over two decades, and all I can say is, finally.\u201d\n\nSeveral people with a role in the staffing process said they found it striking that the 2020 campaigns were focused on such a specific issue so early. In the past, most presidential campaigns have spent the frenzied months before they publicly launch with a laser focus on essentials \u2014 their overarching message, funding, logistics \u2014 and the competition to lock down the most talented staff. Anything considered granular thinking is off the table.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this is one of the things they have to think about as a 100-percent must-have this early in the cycle? That is in and of itself a sign of the power of the Me Too movement,\u201d said one progressive activist. That is doubly true, given that the competition to hire top-tier talent will be more intense in a crowded primary, the activist said.\n\nThe vetting of potential aides is not the only sign of a possible shift. At least one potential candidate went as far as revamping a sexual harassment policy for the campaign trail \u201cmonths ago,\u201d said a senior staff member. And revelations last week that a top aide to Harris had settled a sexual harassment suit before joining her Senate staff forced the aide to resign immediately. Harris, who has proposed legislation to strengthen rights for alleged targets of sexual harassment, claimed she was unaware of her aide\u2019s history.\n\nWhisper Networks And The Hunt For \u2018Total Creeps\u2019\n\nAides and activists insist that screening for workplace issues and building more diverse staffs isn\u2019t just a matter of avoiding political liability. The past year, they said, was an awakening for many of the men who still dominate politics \u2014 and therefore, key hiring decisions \u2014 that one abusive employee can cripple an entire operation. Several consultants and activists who campaigns are asking to pass along trusted names say it\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve received such calls. It\u2019s just the first time they\u2019ve received them from powerful men.\n\n\u201cWomen have always had these whisper networks,\u201d said the former campaign staffer. \u201cWomen have always done the unauthorized background checks to see if the people coming to work with them are total creeps. I think what\u2019s different now is management will listen. There\u2019s a return to the risk women take when they are honest about their professional lives.\u201d\n\nWhat exactly that return will entail isn\u2019t yet clear. The world of campaign politics has no official organization for recording and vetting workplace complaints, and the workplaces themselves dissolve as soon as the election is over. As a consequence, aides and activists said, a campaign\u2019s ability to vet prospective employees is only as good as its political connections.\n\nIt\u2019s a system that easily disregards people who have no political capital and are especially vulnerable to workplace transgressions.\n\nBut to make no effort, said one activist, would be worse."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "National Christmas Tree Dark Due To Government Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-christmas-tree-dark-shutdown_us_5c20c286e4b0407e907d3b90", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Lots of folks aren\u2019t seeing the light in Washington this week.\n\nThe National Christmas Tree may stay dark during the partial government shutdown, according to reports on Sunday.\n\n\u201cDuring the federal government shutdown, the White House Visitor Center and National Christmas Tree site will be closed,\u201d the National Park Service wrote on its website. \u201cRestroom facilities will be closed.\u201d\n\nThe tree, a massive Colorado blue spruce, was damaged Friday when a man in \u201cemotional distress\u201d tried to climb it, a park service spokesperson told The Hill.

Voters rejected the citizen initiative last month, 53 to 47 percent. Three other red states passed similar measures the same day.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nPerhaps the chief takeaway from the rejected citizen initiative to expand Medicaid in Montana last month is this: Be careful when you poke a giant.\n\nMontana was one of four red states with Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and the only one where it failed. And the reason why, many close observers both inside and outside of the state agree, almost certainly came down to a tactical decision to link expansion to an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax.\n\nSupporters thought that strategy would boost their effort with voters, but it attracted Big Tobacco into the fight, along with the $17.2 million it spent, much of it on a television advertising blitz. Opponents raised nearly $19 million to defeat the measure, finance reports filed with the state show.\n\nProponents, with about $9.7 million to spend, simply couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\n\u201cIt was impossible with the money we had to compete,\u201d said one of the leaders of the coalition, who spoke with Stateline but asked not to be named because the coalition has not yet publicly addressed what went wrong. The tobacco interests \u201cgot too far ahead with their messaging.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, this activist said, it may have been a mistake to combine Medicaid expansion and a tax that targeted a deep-pocketed opposition.\n\nThe tobacco industry went nowhere near the other states where Medicaid expanding initiatives appeared on November\u2019s ballot: Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Medicaid expansion plans passed comfortably in those states, but the Montana version fell decisively, 53 to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cThe basic lesson is that if you create a big political target, don\u2019t be surprised if people pay attention to it,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIf you propose to raise tobacco taxes, don\u2019t be surprised if tobacco pushes all its chips in. The same happens when you try to raise soda taxes.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is a government-supported health insurance for the poor, and each state has an option to expand that program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAdam Searing, an associate professor at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, noted that the only difference between Montana and the three other states was the inclusion of a specific tax in the Montana initiative. That inclusion diluted the central message of the ballot measure, he added.\n\n\u201cBasically it seems the more you focus on that central issue of expanding affordable health care to more working class people, the more successful you are likely to be,\u201d Searing said of the success in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that advocates in other non-expansion states might want to take to heart as they continue their fight \u2014 which they are vowing to do, despite the ruling earlier this month by a federal judge in Texas that the entire ACA, including the Medicaid expansion provision, is unconstitutional.\n\nMany legal analysts on both the left and the right say the decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in a lawsuit brought by Republican governors and attorneys general from 20 states is unlikely to stand. In any case, the ACA will remain in place while the ruling makes its way through the appellate courts, perhaps ending up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fairness Project, an advocacy group that reportedly spent $6 million in support of the initiatives in November, names Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming as states where Medicaid expansion initiatives could reach the ballot in 2020. Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the project, said the ruling in Texas hasn\u2019t dampened the group\u2019s conviction that most Americans support expansion.\n\nIn a tracking poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation the week after the midterm elections, 59 percent of voters in non-expansion states said they favored expansion.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid already had been expanded by law in 2016 to include any adult with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line. In 2018, that translates to $16,753 for an individual. Before the expansion, only Montana low-income adults who were caregivers, pregnant or disabled qualified for Medicaid.\n\nBut that 2016 expansion had been set to expire in July 2019. The ballot proposal last month, Initiative 185, would have made the Medicaid expansion permanent. (The other three states will see expansion for the first time.)\n\nNow it will be up to the Republican-controlled legislature to determine the future of the expansion in Montana, a high priority for popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C., have adopted Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nExpansion proponents in the Treasure State think their losing campaign this fall, which entailed a grassroots operation, will pay off with a legislative victory in the winter.\n\nThe pro-expansion campaign, said Jessica Rhoades, Bullock\u2019s health policy adviser, \u201ccreated a volunteer network of very motivated nurses and doctors who can go into the legislative session with a strong base of support behind them.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming Montana House speaker, said court ruling in Texas is worth paying attention to, but it won\u2019t halt work in Montana to craft a Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s financially sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re still forging ahead,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nThe legislative session begins Jan. 7, and lawmakers already are crafting bills in preparation for upcoming hearings, Hertz said. Republicans are interested in cost-control measures that could include performance audits and work requirements for single, able-bodied adults, he said.\n\nMontana Senate President Scott Sales, also a Republican, agreed that expansion proponents will still have the votes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d spoken to me a few days before the court ruling, I\u2019d say Medicaid expansion is going to pass in some form; I think that\u2019s still the case,\u201d Sales said.\n\nFinancial mismatch\n\nThe $19 million raised in opposition to the campaign, 91 percent of it from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, is more than twice the amount spent on Montana ballot measures since at least 2006, data compiled by FollowTheMoney showed. The nonprofit, which tracks campaign spending, found it was also more than $7 million above the amount spent by all candidates in the last Montana gubernatorial election, in 2016.\n\nSupporters of Initiative 185 raised $9.7 million, also more than previous Montana ballot measures. That coalition \u2014 Healthy Montana for I-185 \u2014 included groups representing hospitals and health care providers in the state as well as advocacy groups representing the poor, retired people and labor unions. It also included state chapters of national organizations that support efforts to end diseases, such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\n\nProponents say the financial mismatch doomed the initiative even as pre-election polls had shown voters evenly divided on the measure. Montana State University, for example, reported in late October that 41.4 percent of Montana voters were in favor of expansion versus 40.8 percent against, with a 2 point margin of error.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this article, Chuck Denowh, the spokesman for Montanans Against Tax Hikes \u2014 created for the Medicaid campaign \u2014 and president of the Montana Group, a Helena political and public relationship consulting firm, said he was on a family vacation and couldn\u2019t respond. He did not respond to a request to designate someone else with the organization. Altria did not respond by deadline to a request for an interview.\n\nOther factors besides big spending by tobacco may have contributed to the loss.\n\nThe ballot language began with a description of the tax increase, and that didn\u2019t help, said Jesse Cross-Call of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy and research think tank in Washington. \u201cUnless you were intimately aware of it before going into the voting booth, it was hard to know what was at stake. It looked like the initiative was about raising taxes rather than extending health care to more people.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s measure proposed a general sales tax increase and the initiatives in Idaho and Nebraska left it up to the legislature to decide how to pay for the expansion.\n\nBut, according to Rhoades, early polling suggested that linking a tobacco tax to expansion would improve its chances. That doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case.\n\nCoalition members pushed for the tobacco increase not only as a source of financing for the expansion, but also as a discouragement to smoking, which itself, Healthy Montana claimed, costs Montanans $440 million in health care every year.\n\nThe initiative would have increased the tobacco tax by $2 for a pack of 20 cigarettes. It also would have increased taxes on snuff and created a tax on vaping.\n\nFewer uninsured in Montana\n\nBy March of this year, Montana\u2019s Medicaid had extended benefits to 94,000 newly eligible beneficiaries, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. Bullock\u2019s office said expansion, along with other elements of the Affordable Care Act, reduced the uninsured rate in the state from 15 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent today.\n\nIn its economic analysis, the university report said expansion has injected $350 million to $400 million of new spending into the state each year. That money has generated about 5,000 new jobs and will produce about $270 million in personal income in each year between 2018 and 2020, the report found.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs, with its portion gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. That\u2019s compared with 65.5 percent for traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe proponents of Initiative 185 said the increased tobacco taxes, which they estimated would\u2019ve raised an additional $74 million a year by 2023, would pay for that extra 10 percent.\n\nThe university report estimated that after 2020, when the federal match drops to 90 percent, the increased state tax revenue from the economic activity generated by the expansion would be enough to cover the state\u2019s expansion costs without raising taxes or creating new ones.\n\nThat is the position Bullock has taken in urging the legislature to pass expansion next year. The governor\u2019s proposal does not call for an increase in tobacco taxes but would include a small increase in taxes on medical providers.\n\nBut that was not the message of the initiative\u2019s opponents, who ran ads claiming \u2014 falsely, proponents say \u2014 that the proposed tobacco increase would not cover expansion costs. All Montanans would end up footing the bill, their ads proclaimed.\n\nThe looming question, of course, is what will happen in the legislature. Some of those who led the campaign for expansion have told Stateline they are pessimistic, fearing legislators who are inclined to vote against can now point to the election results to justify a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nCasey Schreiner, the incoming House minority leader and supporter of expansion, said he wasn\u2019t overly worried.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the legislature sees the benefit of taking the sunset off,\u201d the Democrat told Stateline, referring to the July 2019 expiration of the current Medicaid expansion plan. \u201cEverybody understands what happened, that a large amount of money got dumped into Montana and the initiative was mischaracterized as a tax increase rather than expanding health care."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Doctor's Note Policies Punish Students For Being Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-doctors-note-policies-poverty_us_5c1bfc6fe4b05c88b6f66933", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s said that during the holidays, all roads lead home \u2015 or, for those who have access, to the doctor.\n\nThe holiday season is like being invited to a white elephant gift exchange only to find out that each beautifully wrapped box contains a different variation of stomach virus, cold, strep or the flu. Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Health Care In Texas Is A Nightmare For Women Restaurant Workers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-restaurant-workers-sexual-health-care_us_5c1a7690e4b0446830f95b5c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Emily Jaschke Texas is one of the worst states for reproductive health.

Her outrage grew when Donald Trump became president. \u201cAt each step in the political process over the past two years, everything\u2019s so uncertain, and we need to take a stand and let people know the threat women are facing in health care, especially in Texas,\u201d Smith told HuffPost.\n\nIn 2017, the chef helped form I\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having, an organization fronted by chefs, bartenders and servers that\u2019s raising money and awareness to combat the assault on women\u2019s health care in Texas. The group\u2019s footprint is small, but it offers resources to women in an area where the need is great.\n\nIHWSH has helped its nearly 200 members, all of whom are women in the restaurant industry, access free gynecological exams. \u201c[Exams] are typically not covered under insurance,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201ca lot of the women are not provided insurance through employment, and most don\u2019t have insurance on their own.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the group raised and donated more than $210,000 to local organizations that prioritize women\u2019s health, including Planned Parenthood and The Rose, which provides breast cancer detection and treatment services to reduce deaths by the disease.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we become sexually active, we have very few healthcare paths as women. We are either actively preventing pregnancy, not actively preventing pregnancy, actively trying to conceive, or pregnant,\u201d Smith wrote in an essay for Food and Wine. \u201cBecause of this reality, more women are driven away from fields that do not provide easier and more affordable access to healthcare and other valuable resources.\u201d\n\nSmith gained a new level of understanding for her cause in 2018, when she learned she was pregnant. She\u2019s fortunate to be the owner of her restaurant, she said, because it allowed her to come up with a viable maternity leave plan for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very healthy pregnancy, but that\u2019s not the norm for everybody,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf there\u2019d been something that went wrong where the doctor put me on bedrest, I really don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month,\u201d she told HuffPost in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to the doctor all the time now. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something a lot of restaurants are able and willing to accommodate. The restaurant industry in general is made up of mom-and-pop small businesses. You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families. And that\u2019s not fair.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "2018's Most Horrific Sign Of Things To Come Was People With Disabilities Dying In Disasters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-2018-disasters-climate-change-disabilities_us_5c1bc563e4b0407e90784909", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "To mark the end of 2018, we asked writers to revisit some of the year\u2019s most noteworthy (for good or evil) events, people and ideas. See the other entries here between now and the new year.\n\n\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Jim Knaver and his wife, Anna Hastings (known as Toni), spotted a little smoke in the air from their home in Paradise, California. They knew the risks of fire and had diligently cleared any flammable debris from their property. Jim checked the news for fire danger, he later told NPR, then drove to teach his fourth-grade class. Toni was disabled and didn\u2019t drive, which was a concern, but the couple planned to stay in touch and figured Jim could just drive back if she needed to evacuate. Later that morning, the Camp Fire roared through Paradise at unprecedented speed. Without transportation or even the means to flee on foot, Toni couldn\u2019t get out. Jim lost touch over the phone around 11 a.m. Five days later, search teams confirmed they had found Toni\u2019s remains.\n\nWe live in an era of flood and fire. That disasters like the Camp Fire and the devastating hurricanes that have struck the U.S. in recent years are more frequent and more severe because of human-caused climate change is an indisputable scientific fact. Unless something changes, as the waters rise and the air grows thick with smoke, as medicines run out and food systems collapse, as higher, wetter, or more fertile ground becomes the only resource that matters, millions of people like Toni \u2015 millions of poor and non-wealthy, elderly, people with disabilities \u2015 are going to die.\n\nThere has never been a threat to humanity quite like catastrophic climate change. First, while most great disasters spring upon us quickly, we\u2019ve known the threat has been coming for almost 200 years. Second, we now have the technology to ameliorate the worst of the consequences, which is again unprecedented in human history. We couldn\u2019t have stopped the Black Death, for example, but the decarbonization of society is possible. Instead, year after year, things get worse, and we still do nothing. Yes, we have solar panels and wind farms, but the rate of fossil fuel use is projected to rise through 2040, and 2018 had the highest level of global carbon emission in history. The green technology thus far deployed will have no more effect than pouring a thimbleful of water on a raging blaze.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWhen the worst happens, disabled people will die first. The problems extend far beyond wheelchair users who cannot physically evacuate through inaccessible areas. For example, I am mentally disabled. Without access to psychiatric medication, I wonder whether I could stave off suicidal ideation in the face of local climate collapse. Think about all the people who require insulin, chemotherapy, specialized nourishment pumped into their stomach, or people who can\u2019t access a shelter because it has no ramp or because crowds make them panic. The threats extend across categories.\n\nIn November, Alice Wong, a Bay Area resident and global disability justice leader, wrote about receiving air quality alerts as smoke from the fires more than 160 miles away made it dangerous to go outside. She knew she was privileged to stay home with her air purifier but rightly worried for those with lung-related conditions who lacked homes, access to masks, or other medical support.\n\nMarcie Roth, former FEMA official and currently CEO of the National Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, tells me there\u2019s been a \u201cfailure to plan. And a failure to meet the equal access requirements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe climate change adaptation folks are not really talking to the disaster risk reduction folks who are not really talking to the humanitarian relief folks who are not really talking to the CRPD [U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] folks who are not really talking to the strategic development/plan folks,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much siloing going on.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 article for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Roth argued that lack of planning for inclusive disaster relief puts everyone at risk, writing, \u201cA resilient community will plan for \u2013 and with \u2013 all of its members.\u201d\n\nWe can fix this. Not only can we focus our disaster responses on the most vulnerable people, but we can elect representatives who are willing to say the word, \u201cdecarbonization.\u201d As the 2020 Democratic Primary begins (it\u2019s already begun), who will be brave enough to speak up for those already being killed by climate change? To lead us out of the fire and floods?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Renews Attack on Fed as Mnuchin Tries to Calm Markets", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/politics/trump-renews-attack-on-fed-as-mnuchin-tries-to-calm-markets.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-24 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "With stocks extending their slide Monday, President Trump took another swipe at the Federal Reserve, writing on Twitter that the \u201conly problem our economy has is the Fed\u201d as he continued to blame the central bank for recent volatility in the financial markets.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s comments only exacerbated the sell-off on Wall Street, and stocks were on track for their worst year since 2008 and the largest December decline since the 1930s.

The American consumer appears strong; this is looking to have been one of the strongest holiday sales seasons in many years.\n\nSurveys of supply managers, which act as an early warning system for slowdowns in business activity, are in strongly positive territory. In the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s surveys, an index above 50 indicates the economy is in expansion; its most recent reading was 62.1 for the manufacturing sector and 60.7 for services.\n\nThe most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.\n\nFor example, the two-year Treasury bond yielded 2.64 percent at Friday\u2019s close. That\u2019s still higher than the roughly 2.4 percent where the Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight rate now sits. You would expect that if a recession were imminent, the two-year yield would fall lower, reflecting expectations of Fed rate cuts to combat the downturn.\n\nAt this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.\n\nMost economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.\n\nIn this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts.

Borrowing in the corporate bond markets has already slowed as nervous investors demand higher interest rates on risky debt.

In a statement Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said he had contacted the chief executives of six major banks to make sure their operations were running smoothly.\n\nMr. Mnuchin, who made the calls while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said that bank executives confirmed they had sufficient liquidity for lending and market operations \u2014 the kind of statement the government usually reserves for moments of genuine uncertainty about the health of the financial system.

By raising rates, the Fed is bringing to a close its long campaign of economic stimulus that began during the 2008 financial crisis, which included lowering interest rates to near zero.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump is hardly alone in his opposition to the Fed\u2019s move. Some economists argue the Fed should continue its stimulus campaign to drive up employment and wages. They note that the Fed is about to undershoot its 2 percent inflation target for the seventh consecutive year, suggesting there is no need to step on the brakes.\n\nMany investors had also wanted a pause, and the decision set off another slide in stock prices.\n\nBut even investors who disagreed with Wednesday\u2019s decision generally do not want politicians to play a larger role in Fed policymaking, preferring to leave the management of interest rates primarily in the hands of technocrats. Most developed nations have granted their central banks considerable autonomy over policymaking precisely because of concerns that politicians would seek to increase short-term growth at the expense of inflation and instability.\n\nIn fact, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank\u2019s chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be \u201cashamed\u201d for keeping interest rates low \u2014 a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Economy Is Strong.

After that, chronotype creeps in the other direction, which is why older people typically find themselves waking earlier than they used to.\n\nBut chronotype determines more than when you sleep and wake. It orchestrates predictable peaks and troughs of energy over the course of the 24-hour day. The so-called \u201cwindow of circadian low\u201d \u2014 the hours when the body is least adapted for wakefulness \u2014 typically occurs between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. There\u2019s another, smaller dip 12 hours later, in the midafternoon.\n\nThere are also two high points, when thinking is sharp and reaction times quick.
