His work could make life in the Oval Office even more uncomfortable.\n\nIn a rant extraordinary even by the standards of his searing morning tweetstorms, the President claimed Mueller's team was tainted by conflicts of interest and stacked with Democrats. He also asked whether the final report would criticize his political nemeses such as former FBI Director James Comey and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Will Robert Mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report,\" Trump wrote, before turning on the special counsel's top lieutenant.\n\n\"Will Andrew Weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report. He wrongly destroyed people's lives, took down great companies...\"\n\nMueller is facing a deadline to explain to a judge in Washington why he has accused Manafort, Trump's already convicted and jailed former campaign chairman, of lying and breaking a cooperation deal.\n\nAnd he must also deliver documents to a court in New York recommending whether Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, should go to jail and for how long, after Cohen turned against his former top client and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.\n\n\"A total witch hunt,\" Trump said at one point, repeating his preferred moniker for the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe twin filings represent yet another dramatic moment for the Mueller investigation and are being eagerly awaited in Washington for signs of how the Russia drama will unfold in the weeks ahead and how much it may eventually hurt Trump.\n\nYet as with this week's feverishly anticipated sentencing memo about Trump's ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, the filings could bring a measure of disappointment to special counsel watchers if large quantities of evidence are redacted to protect ongoing investigations.\n\nEven if important context remains under seal, Mueller often delivers hints and opens loops in court documents that sketch a colorful narrative of the Russia affair, and may offer pointers of where a probe branded \"presidential harassment\" by Trump on Thursday is going.\n\nNeither of Friday's deadlines involves action implicating the President directly in any wrongdoing, more than 18 months after Mueller was chosen to find out whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian election interference in 2016.\n\nBut in recent weeks it has become clear that the special counsel is using proceedings and filings concerning key witnesses and former Trump associates to suggest a pattern of questionable behavior on the part of the President.\n\nIt's clear that Trump's behavior has worried officials at the Justice Department since nearly the start of his presidency. CNN reported Thursday on the frantic days that followed the President's firing of then-FBI Director James Comey , which led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials to view Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time. Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before Mueller was appointed, the sources said.\n\nSince then, Mueller has constructed a tapestry of disclosures that started with an accounting of a hacking operation by Moscow's intelligence agencies and has unveiled multiple links between Russians and people around Trump -- and repeated lies about those contacts.\n\nFriday's activity will end an ominous week for Trump in which it has become clear that the investigation is far broader beneath the surface than is publicly evident. Mueller can now be said to be digging into possible collusion with the Russians, obstruction of justice, contacts with Russian officials during Trump's transition, possible campaign finance violations and the President's business secrets.\n\nA frantic Friday revolving around the Russia drama also features a return to center stage by Comey, who is testifying in private to two House committees as Republicans throw their final blocks for Trump before handing over control to Democrats next month. A transcript of the encounter is expected to be released within 24 hours.\n\nAnd a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, was released from prison in Wisconsin after serving a 14-day sentence for lying to the FBI.\n\nIn another development that could affect the Mueller probe, Trump said he would nominate William Barr as attorney general to fill a post Barr also held in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Barr is seen as a mainstream choice, though has previously criticized aspects of the Russia investigation. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be responsible for overseeing the special counsel.\n\nIf that were not enough, Trump's longtime informal political adviser Roger Stone -- who is being investigated for alleged cooperation with WikiLeaks, which posted emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by Russian agents -- said he would not turn against the President.\n\n\"This is not about Russian collusion, it's about the parsing of words,\" Stone said. \"It's about process crimes and perjury traps, and I decline to participate.\"\n\n'Crimes and lies'\n\nMueller has pledged to tell the court abou t Manafort's \"crimes and lies\" t hat he said were committed after the uber-lobbyist signed a plea agreement and have sparked speculation the former campaign chairman is angling for a presidential pardon.\n\nThe disclosures from Mueller's team will be closely watched to see whether Manafort, who is at risk of spending the rest of his life in jail, lied about activity that could implicate Trump or senior campaign officials, or solely about the business interests in Ukraine that led to his downfall on fraud charges or other questions.\n\nManafort is an important witness for Mueller since he was at a notorious Trump Tower meeting in 2016 in which the candidate's son Don Jr. believed Russian intermediaries would deliver \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nHe could also be useful in establishing wheth er changes to the platform at the Republican National Convention that watered down criticism of Russia had followed requests from Moscow.\n\nLawyers for Manafort denied their client lied and will have a chance to challenge the special counsel's assertions before his sentencing date of March 5.\n\nIt is possible that some of Mueller's explanations will be blacked out, as they were in the Flynn filing. But a spokesman for the special counsel's office has said that at least some of the filing will be public.\n\nRoss Garber, a lawyer who specializes in impeachment, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday that it was not normal for a cooperation agreement to collapse in such a manner, given the intensive negotiations that typically happen beforehand.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether anything new came up that nobody expected, but it is very unusual,\" Garber said.\n\nMueller's decision to come down hard on Manafort but to offer leniency to Flynn was widely interpreted as a sign that he will reward people implicated in the investigation who are willing to tell the truth about what happened -- but will tolerate no obstruction.\n\nCohen resets his life's 'compass'\n\nCohen has asked the court for a non-custodial sentence after he admitted tax fraud and lying to Congress about Trump's business aspirations in Moscow to preserve the President's political narrative that he had no ties to Russia.\n\nCohen's lawyers said in a memo that their client -- by turning on Trump, for whom he once said he would take a bullet -- had decided to \"re-point his internal compass true north toward a productive, ethical and thoroughly law-abiding life.\"\n\nSentencing documents filed by both sides in the case have connected significant dots in the investigation.\n\nLast week, Cohen pleaded guilty to misleading lawmakers about a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which he had originally said had been shelved by January 2016.\n\nIn fact, the project was alive until June 2016, according to a statement lodged with the court by Mueller, who said Cohen had discussed the plan with Trump several times and had briefed Trump family members.\n\nThe revelations were important because Trump had insisted throughout the campaign that he had no business links with Russia.\n\nThey also raised the question of whether the President was beholden to Russia for a long period of the campaign and was shaping his complimentary statements about President Vladimir Putin to further his own financial interests.\n\nCohen has also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations connected to hush money paid to women who alleged affairs with Trump, which the President has denied.\n\n\"Michael kept his client contemporaneously informed and acted on his client's instructions,\" Cohen's lawyers wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\n\"Michael felt obligated to assist Client-1, (Trump) on Client-1's instruction, to attempt to prevent Woman-1 and Woman-2 from disseminating narratives that would adversely affect the Campaign and cause personal embarrassment to Client-1 and his family.\"\n\nCohen, who faced 46 to 63 months in jail under his original plea deal with New York prosecutors, is hoping that Mueller will grant him the same kind of favorable treatment as Flynn. The special counsel told a court this week that owing to Flynn's cooperation with the investigation, the former national security adviser should get no jail time. Redactions in documents accompanying the request made it impossible, however, to assess what that cooperation entailed and whether it put the President in any jeopardy.\n\nTrump has reacted angrily to the idea that Cohen could get a break from Mueller in return for his cooperation.\n\n\"He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence,\" the President tweeted earlier this week.\n\nDepending on the details Mueller chooses to unveil on Friday, it is almost certain that Trump's allies will reach for their familiar argument that the special counsel still has not proved any cooperation between Russia and the campaign -- the original mandate of the probe.\n\nBut with every move he makes, Mueller appears to be getting closer to the people who are closest to the President himself, so in the broadest sense there's every chance that Friday could effectively be another rough day in court for Trump.\n\nThis post has been updated to include additional developments."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Jeffrey Toobin: Even Nixon didn't do stuff this crazy", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/LelCMDJ3tKk/donald-trump-rod-rosenstein-fbi-jeffrey-toobin-sot-vpx-ac360.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's Jeffrey Toobin responds after learning that after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials viewed Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: The Flynn filing should really scare Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/OR54MqYz1AQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The biggest story of the sentencing document filed by special counsel Robert Mueller's office on Michael Flynn is what's not in it. There are large swaths of redactions, making it hard to see exactly what Mueller is doing -- and what specific role the Trump administration's former national security adviser is playing in it all.\n\nBut there's a single sentence in the 13-page document that should send shivers down the spine of President Donald Trump and everyone in his inner circle. It's this: \"The defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government.\"\n\nPay specific attention to those last few words: \"Substantially assisting the government.\"\n\nAnd then remember these things:\n\n1) Flynn is the only one of the seven Trump associates who have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the Mueller probe who bridges the divide between Trump's campaign, the transition and the presidency. Flynn was an adviser to the campaign, a member of the transition team and, for about three weeks, the administration's national security adviser.\n\n2) Flynn pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017 . That, for you calendar buffs out there, is more than a year ago. We know from the sentencing documents that Flynn has met with the special counsel's team 19 -- yes, 19! -- times during that period. We also know Mueller has delayed Flynn's sentencing four times over the last year.\n\nWhat emerges from the sentencing document is this: Flynn may well be the key cog of the Mueller investigation. He's been less showy than former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. And less lie-y than former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But given that Mueller recommends no jail time for Flynn despite his crimes of lying to the FBI about the nature and extent of his contacts with Russia and Turkey during the election and transition, you can assume that the cooperation and information the former national security adviser has provided is substantial.\n\nFlynn was the first Trump associate to plead guilty and agree to cooperate with Mueller. And a reading of the sentencing document makes clear that Flynn is providing information and guidance regarding \"several\" ongoing investigations: 1) a criminal investigation of unknown origin and focus 2) the special counsel investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election to aid Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton and 3) a investigation of unknown origin and focus.\n\nThat's a BIG deal. Instead of a single investigation into Russian interference, there are actually (at least) three investigations being pursued, to which Flynn has been of material aid. Three!\n\nTo be clear: There is ZERO evidence in either the sentencing document or the addendum to it that suggest Trump himself is a focus of any of these investigations. We can't say the President isn't a target -- because this is an ongoing series of investigations the details of which Mueller is working hard to keep under wraps -- but we can't say he is one either.\n\nBut if I am the President or his eldest son or son-in-law or lots of other people involved in the 2016 campaign, the transition or the administration, the sentencing document on Flynn has to make me very, very edgy. He's talking -- and talking and talking. And judging from the reaction of the Mueller team, it's not just idle words; prosecutors don't recommend zero jail time for someone who hasn't been of considerable aid to their broader efforts.\n\nThe words of Flynn on the day he pleaded guilty then take on even more resonance with a year's hindsight.\n\n\"I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,\" Flynn said. \"My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflects a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Japan needs immigrants, but do immigrants need Japan?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/fzR6CrXb7Ks/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "The series on Japan's demographic reckoning is supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

Family, friends and close acquaintances are insiders, referred to as \"uchi,\" while \"soto\" is for those relegated to the periphery.\n\nThe second type, which would have no renewal limit, is aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. Both visas require proficiency in Japanese.\n\nThe first, renewable for up to 5 years, would cover semi-qualified, blue-collar workers, and is aimed at plugging gaps in areas such as care-giving and manufacturing.\n\nA proposed amendment to the immigration law, if passed, will create two new visas for foreign workers.\n\nFor this Japan-obsessed student in Vietnam, it felt like a warning: she could be about to enter a deeply closed society that would always consider her an outsider.\n\nUltimately, though, that was not Nguyen's experience. The 25-year-old discovered that Japan was slowly changing.\n\nAs Japan's population gets older and smaller, the government is struggling to balance its own deeply conservative views on immigration with the need for new and younger workers. Public opinion is on the side of change. Despite perceptions of xenophobia, a 2018 Pew survey revealed that 59% of Japanese believed immigrants would actually make the country stronger.\n\nOn Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to ask lawmakers to vote on an unprecedented policy change to welcome more foreign workers. If approved, the landmark ruling could see an estimated 340,000 high-skilled and low-wage workers move to Japan over the next five years. But many argue the lack of details surrounding the policy, undermines it.\n\nVietnamese student Linh Nyugen came to Japan to pursue higher education.\n\nShrinking nation\n\nJapan is already a \"super-aged\" nation -- meaning that more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017, a record low since official records began in 1899, while an increase in deaths accelerated the population decline.\n\nThe decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of healthcare and pensions.\n\nBut Japan isn't the only country with such a problem.\n\nSingapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries. Germany is a also a \"super-aged\" nation. And by 2030 , the US, UK,Singapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries.\n\nIf Abe is to prevent Japan's population from dipping below 100 million by 2060 , he will need to provide migrants good reasons to choose the country, says Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nA 2015 Pew survey exploring how people in Asia-Pacific see each other revealed that a median of 71% of people in the region held a favorable view of Japan, with positive views exceeding negative sentiment by more than five-to-one.\n\nNguyen points to Japan's solid environmental practices and strong safety record as appealing factors.\n\nBut the country's historic failure to integrate previous waves of foreign workers raises questions as to why migrants would choose to come to Japan.\n\nFaced with labor shortages in the 1990s Japan revised its immigration rules to offer long-term, renewable visas to the descendants of Japanese immigrants who had moved to Latin American after World War II.\n\nBut when the economy slumped in 2008, the government urged those same immigrants to return to Brazil and the other Latin American nations where they had moved from.\n\n\"Japan treats its foreign workers like Kleenex,\" says Jeff Kingston, a Japanese studies professor at Temple University. \"They have a use-it, toss-it mentality.\"\n\nOther options nearby\n\nSingapore has a very different track record. Since independence in 1965, the small South-east Asian city state has built a diverse society by taking in large numbers of immigrants from neighboring Asian countries.\n\nToday, foreigners make up more than one-third of Singapore's labor force , though conditions are challenging for low-skilled laborers and numerous abuses exist.\n\nOn its website , the Singapore government states that non-resident foreigners do jobs Singaporeans don't want, and do not compete with locals for high-paying professional or managerial jobs. \"They are here to help build our homes, keep our roads clean, and make our lives just a little more comfortable,\" the website says.\n\nThe new visa will allow blue collar workers to stay in Japan for up to five years.\n\nExperts argue that Japan lags behind other industrialized countries in extolling the benefits of immigration to its domestic population. \"The government needs to sell how these people contribute to pensions and economic growth,\" Kingston says.\n\nAs immigration policy has failed to keep up with demand, temporary fixes have plugged the gap. Foreigners on student visas, for example, can work up to 28 hours per week -- but Japan has been accused of using students to fill labor shortages.\n\nis one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan.

Its range of services grew as people wanted help getting phone contracts, setting up bank accounts, going to hospital and finding part-time jobs.\n\nYusuke Furumi, an employee there, hopes Japan can gradually become more open to the idea of working alongside foreigners, and make it easier for them to stay and contribute to the economy and society.\n\nEnter the outback\n\nIn the small town of Muroto, in southeastern Japan, foreigners on the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) have come to the rescue.\n\nOnce a booming fishing port, today Muroto has a graying community. Vacant houses pockmark the area where the town's bars once thrived. Many of the town's public facilities such as hospitals and elementary schools have shut down.\n\nSo when Mie Kinoshita was unable to find a mechanic to work in her car dealership in 2017, she decided to outsource her needs -- and applied to receive technical interns from the Philippines.\n\nJohn Riggs Ancino is shadowing Masahiro Maeda.\n\nThe scheme has faced frequent criticism since its establishment in 1993. In theory, the TITP allows low-skilled workers to come to Japan to learn technical skills they can later take back to their home countries. But opponents of the program allege it has been used as a loophole to plug gaps in the domestic labor market. Trainees, meanwhile, have reported frequent instances of workplace abuse and bullying.\n\nKinoshita was aware of the horror stories. To help create a more welcoming environment, she bought a house for her staff. And while they presently only make minimum wage, which is 762 yen ($6.70) an hour in Muroto, she hopes to increase their wages as their skills grow.\n\nKinoshita's employees John Riggs Ancino and Marvin Curilan, arrived in Muroto from the Philippines two months ago. On arrival in Japan, the pair received several weeks of Japanese language and culture lessons.\n\n\"I'd like to stay here,\" says Riggs Ancino, who worked in a tire repair shop back home. \"It would be great if I could build a family in Japan.\"\n\nTheir Japanese colleagues also appreciate the newcomers.\n\n\"It's still hard for us to understand one another, but I've been working on my English skills,\" says Masahiro Maeda, a mechanic in his late 50s. \"I'd like them to stay.\"\n\nMasoto Yasuda, a mechanic in his late 30s, adds: \"I want to go to the Philippines now. It hadn't really crossed my mind before I met them.\"\n\nBoth local and foreign workers at the car dealership said they hoped the immigrants could stay in Japan.\n\nUnder the current rules, technical trainees can only work in Japan for five years.\n\nAbe's proposals, however, would allow them to apply for an additional five years. But there's a catch. To do so they would have to apply from their home countries, denying them the right to seek permanent residency -- which requires 10 years of continuous living in Japan.\n\nExperts fear terms like this may run through many of Abe's new proposals, helping more blue collars workers come to Japan -- but preventing them from settling long term.\n\nJapan's work culture\n\nWhile Japan might be coming around to the appeal of foreigner workers, not all of the newcomers are keen on Japanese work culture.\n\nSamir Levi came to Japan from Nepal four years ago, after his older brother did a six-week cultural exchange in Tokyo. Levi, 26, worked a part-time job as a dishwasher in a ramen shop and the graveyard shift at a convenience store, before becoming a recruiter for a Japanese language school in the capital.\n\nHe has absorbed the Japanese habits of gently bobbing the head in agreement and executing a well-timed farewell bow. \"I blend in here now,\" he says. \"I've become Japanese in some ways.\"\n\nLevi meets up with friends in Shin-Okubo, an area of Tokyo split along gastronomical lines.\n\nBut the longer Levi lives in Japan, the less he wants to stay. Now a salary man, Levi clocks long hours -- just like locals. Earlier this year, the government limited overtime to 100 hours per month, but Levi yearns for better options.\n\nNow he wants to move to the US or Australia.\n\nNguyen, too, has integrated into Japan and has a mix of local and migrant friends. But she is wary of committing to Japan's long working hours and culture of heavy out-of-office drinking with colleagues, known as \"nomikai.\"\n\nShe would stay in Japan, she says, if she could bring her parents to live with her. Failing that, she might move to Australia or Canada or go back to Vietnam.\n\n\"I haven't lost my fascination with Japan yet,\" Nyugen says. \"But perhaps Japan may need to realize that it needs foreigners as opposed to the other way around.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Can Trump still deliver China deal after Huawei arrest?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/5X2Btqw6M3c/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The arrest of a top Chinese technology executive should have been a triumphant moment for the Trump administration.\n\nInstead, the detention of Chinese tech giant Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver, British Columbia, triggered a market meltdown Thursday amid uncertainty about whether President Donald Trump can strike a lasting trade deal with Beijing.\n\nThe volatility put a spotlight on doubts about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises with China -- and exposed a clash between his policy goals in China and his efforts to crack down on technology companies and other actors.\n\nThe Dow crashed by as much as 785 points before recovering on Thursday. It had slipped nearly 800 points earlier this week on investor concerns about the status of the trade talks.

Her arrest follows reports this year that the Justice Department was investigating whether Huawei had violated American sanctions on Iran . The Justice Department is seeking Meng's extradition, according to a White House official.\n\nHuawei said in a statement about Meng's arrest that it \"has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng.\"\n\n\"Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU,\" it added.\n\nThe timing of the arrest couldn't have been more awkward. Meng was detained in Canada on Saturday, the same day Trump sat down over a steak dinner to hash out an oral agreement with Xi in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe arrest wasn't made public until late Wednesday.\n\n\"The Chinese will absolutely interpret it as being directly connected,\" said Dean Cheng, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow on Chinese political and security affairs. \"Having a better sense of how American bureaucracy works, I'd be more skeptical.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"from the Chinese perspective, this is going to be absolutely seen as part and parcel of our negotiating practice.\"\n\nThe White House says Trump and his close aides were not aware the US planned to place an extradition request for Meng ahead of his dinner with Xi on Saturday.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton said in an interview with National Public Radio that he was aware before the dinner that an arrest was coming.\n\nBolton told NPR that Huawei has represented \"enormous concerns for years\" for the US over the theft of American intellectual property and forced technology transfers, two notable issues the administration is seeking to resolve as part of the trade negotiations.\n\nAaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center, said the clash of priorities -- squeezing Iran on one hand and reaching a trade agreement with China on the other -- was likely accidental.\n\n\"If the Trump administration were really serious about Iran, that would be the overwhelming priority, and it wouldn't have granted waivers to eight countries allowing them to import Iranian oil,\" Miller said. \"I think this is a question of one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing.\"\n\nYet another administration official told CNN the US would seek Meng's extradition from Canada, adding that it could provide Washington with leverage against China as trade talks proceed.\n\nLong viewed by US intelligence agencies as a national security threat, Huawei is one of China's most prominent tech companies. It sells more smartphones than Apple (AAPL) and builds telecommunications networks in countries around the world.\n\nCanada's top cyber official said the country is prepared for possible retaliation from Beijing for the arrest of Huawei's CFO.\n\nScott Jones, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, said he could not directly answer any questions in relation to the case, but added, \"We always have to be resilient no matter what the possible trigger could be, so we increase our resilience against any form of malicious activity that we could be facing as a nation. We are working very closely with the broader security community.\"\n\nJones confirmed that Canada is assessing the security risk and he refused to indicate when that review would be completed. Canada released its long-scheduled Cyber Threat Assessment today, the first of its kind in the country.\n\nHuawei's smaller rival, ZTE (ZTCOF), provides an example of how the US government could go further. The Chinese company was crippled for months after the Commerce Department blocked it from buying vital parts from American companies.\n\nThe ban threatened to put ZTE out of business and highlighted China's continued reliance on American technology, a vulnerability Beijing is eager to reduce. ZTE eventually got a reprieve after Xi asked Trump for help. But the crisis caused disruption for telecommunications carriers and ZTE suppliers around the world.\n\nA similar ban on Huawei would have a bigger impact because its equipment is more widely used."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Kevin Hart pulls out as Oscars host after homophobic tweets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/Wd9DfJoE6CY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Kevin Hart is stepping down from hosting the Oscars after homophobic tweets surfaced on Thursday.\n\nThe tweets, between 2009 and 2011, included derogatory language referring to gay people and made disparaging comments about sexuality.\n\nKevin Hart\n\nIn one of the tweets from 2011, among some that have been deleted, the comedian-actor said, \"Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice 'stop that's gay'.\"\n\n\"I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscar's,\" Hart, who is currently performing in Sydney, Australia, announced late Sunday on Twitter. \"This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists.

And though we don't know exactly what that temperature tipping point is, \"what's clear is that the more we warm, the more ice melts.\"\n\n\"Once the ice sheets reach these tipping points, it's thought that they'll go into a state of irreversible retreat, so they'll be responding to what we do now for centuries and milliennia into the future,\" Trusel said.\n\nDas stressed that although climate science often focuses on the future impacts of warming, the findings show that the climate is already undergoing hugely significant changes.\n\n\"Climate change -- whether it's in Greenland or in your backyard -- is already here and already happening and already impacting people.

Kenneth Bernard Pius Hendricks, 77, originally from Cincinnati, was arrested Wednesday in the Philippine city of Naval after several alleged victims came forward to Philippine and US investigators last month, authorities said.\n\nThough court documents filed in late November cite five accusers, a total of 10 accusers have now come forward in the Philippines, alleging Hendricks sexually abused them when they were boys, US Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Steve Francis said Thursday in Cincinnati.\n\nBecause Hendricks also spends parts of the year in the United States, investigators are asking the public in both countries for information about the priest.\n\n\"It's horrifying ... abusive conduct,\" US attorney Benjamin Glassman said Thursday about the allegations in the Philippines. \"It's grooming children -- young children -- that are interested in being involved in church activities and taking those kids and sexually abusing them.\"\n\n\"He befriended them, he would invite them to his residence\" before engaging in progressively intimate contact, sometimes including oral and anal sex, Glassman said.\n\nUS law criminalizes certain illegal sexual conduct by American citizens abroad. Hendricks is charged in federal court in Cincinnati on a count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places , punishable by fines and/or up to 30 years in prison.\n\nHendricks was being held in a Philippines Bureau of Immigrations holding facility in Manila, the bureau said. His attorney in the Philippines, Mario Ope\u00f1a, told CNN that the priest maintains the allegations are false.\n\n\"As far as Father Hendricks is concerned, the allegations are not true and he will prove his innocence in court,\" Ope\u00f1a said.\n\nHow the investigation started\n\nHendricks has been a priest in Naval, a city of about 50,000 people in central Philippines, the country's Bureau of Immigration said.\n\nHe was ordained as a priest in the Philippines after arriving in the country in the 1960s, said the Rev. Benjamin Pantas, spokesman for the Diocese of Naval.\n\nThe Naval diocese is conducting a parallel, independent investigation, Pantas said.\n\nOf the allegations cited by the five accusers in a probable cause affidavit filed in court, the earliest dates to 2009. The accusers' ages at the start of the alleged abuse range from 7 to the teens, Glassman said.\n\nThe Philippine National Police began investigating around November 6 when two accusers, including a young man, came forward, the affidavit says.\n\nAmong the man's allegations, according to the document:\n\n\u2022 Hendricks began sexually abusing him around 2009 when he was a 12-year-old serving as a sacristan in a church in Naval. Hendricks first kissed him on the lips while the boy was cleaning the church.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would beg him to sleep at the priest's home, and the accuser believed he had no choice. The priest would insist that they bathe together, and the priest would have oral and anal sex with him.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would molest him alone or with several other boys who \"resided with Hendricks during that time.\"\n\n\u2022 Hendricks said they \"would both go to jail\" if the abuse was reported to authorities.\n\n\u2022 The abuse stopped when the accuser was 15, after he contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAnother of the accusers alleged that Hendricks had anal sex at least a dozen times and oral sex more than 30 times, the Cincinnati US attorney's office said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when or how the US Homeland Security Investigations agents got involved. But HSI agents interviewed the adult accuser and four other accusers November 26-28, the affidavit says.\n\n'I ... will have to probably really resign, retire now'\n\nHSI received a recorded conversation, purportedly between Hendricks and the adult accuser in November, in which the two apparently discuss the accuser having talked to police, the affidavit says.\n\nIn the recording, the priest said he's \"waiting for the fallout,\" according to the affidavit.\n\n\"There will be a meeting and then it will be decided, you know, what your parents want to do about anything. Do they want to try ... to press charges ... but that's between them and the bishop,\" Hendricks said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"They will decide, ask you what your decision is, what you're going to do, whether there will be a case or not or whether, you know, a settlement, I don't know. But as far as after that, I don't know what's going to happen. I really will have to probably really resign, retire now,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\nEventually, the affidavit says, the accuser asked whether Hendricks admits to having sex with boys.\n\n\"It's already blottered,\" Hendricks said, apparently referring to the accuser's conversation with police. \"You put it on a blotter. Will I lie? It was a mistake on my part. Should have known better than trying to just have life,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Other children may have been impacted'\n\nGlassman, the US attorney, said Hendricks is not accused of abusing anyone in the United States, but investigators will explore the time he has spent in his native country.\n\nHendricks would spend several months a year in the United States -- likely in the Cincinnati area, after flying from the Philippines into Los Angeles, Glassman said.\n\nThe federal prosecutor said he didn't immediately know exactly where or how Hendricks would spend his time in the United States. But the affidavit says bank records indicate Hendricks has a residence in Cincinnati.\n\n\"We want to find out: Are there any victims in the United States -- in Cincinnati, in Ohio, Los Angeles or wherever?\" Glassman said during a news conference Thursday in Cincinnati. \"(We want to) hold Father Hendricks accountable for any sexual abuse of children here, just as we want to hold him accountable for any sexual abuse that he's committed in the Philippines.\"\n\nFrancis, the HSI agent, said: \"We believe there is a high probability that other children may have been impacted by his alleged actions.\"\n\nAsked whether the Philippines would want to put Hendricks on trial there instead of extraditing him to the United States, Glassman said: \"That is something we are working out with them right now.\"\n\nHendricks was not a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, archdiocese spokesman Mike Schafer said.\n\nThe priest as listed on the archdiocese's website as being a missionary in the Philippines.\n\nBut Schafer, in email to CNN, wrote that Hendricks \"is not 'assigned internationally by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati to mission work.'\"\n\n\"Hendricks is not, nor never has been, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Philippines to serve in a diocese there,\" Schafer wrote.\n\nToni Cashnelli, communications director for the Franciscan Friars, Province of St. John the Baptist in Cincinnati, said Hendricks was a brother with the Franciscan Friars.\n\nHe made temporary vows in 1962, solemn vows in 1965 and in 1986 asked to be released, Cashnelli said.

ESL says its plan would save 50,000 jobs. Sears employed 68,000 people at the time of its Oct. 15 bankruptcy filing\n\nFederal Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Drain, who is hearing the bankruptcy case, would have to approve the plan before Sears could be purchased by ESL. A committee of Sears' creditors has argued in court that the company would be better off shutting all of its stores and liquidating the assets to return the greatest amount of money to lenders.\n\nIn a court filing, the creditors' attorney called Sears' plan to become profitable \"nothing more than wishful thinking \" and \"an unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people's money.\"\n\nLampert would be putting up a very limited amount of new cash as part of his bid. The proposal calls for $950 million in cash to come from loans that Sears would borrow.\n\nESL is offering to take equity stakes in Sears in return for forgiving $1.8 billion of secured debt that Sears owes it. That debt is backed by hard assets, such as real estate. ESL also proposes assuming $1.1 billion in liabilities, such as extended warranties, gift cards and points accrued by shoppers in its loyalty program.\n\nThe bid is for the assets of the company, including its store inventory and balances owed on its credit cards. Other assets included in the bid are its Diehard battery brand, Sears' home improvement business and the Kenmore appliance brand , for which ESL had previously offered $400 million.\n\nA spokesperson for Sears Holding declined to comment on the bid.

Sears had nearly 700 stores remaining at the time of its bankruptcy filing and is in the process of closing nearly 200 of those stores\n\nWinning the approval of creditors and Judge Drain will not be easy, said Philip Emma, a senior analyst with Debtwire and expert in retail bankruptcies.\n\n\"Can they be convinced?

His work could make life in the Oval Office even more uncomfortable.\n\nIn a rant extraordinary even by the standards of his searing morning tweetstorms, the President claimed Mueller's team was tainted by conflicts of interest and stacked with Democrats. He also asked whether the final report would criticize his political nemeses such as former FBI Director James Comey and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Will Robert Mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report,\" Trump wrote, before turning on the special counsel's top lieutenant.\n\n\"Will Andrew Weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report. He wrongly destroyed people's lives, took down great companies...\"\n\nMueller is facing a deadline to explain to a judge in Washington why he has accused Manafort, Trump's already convicted and jailed former campaign chairman, of lying and breaking a cooperation deal.\n\nAnd he must also deliver documents to a court in New York recommending whether Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, should go to jail and for how long, after Cohen turned against his former top client and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.\n\n\"A total witch hunt,\" Trump said at one point, repeating his preferred moniker for the Mueller investigation.\n\nThe twin filings represent yet another dramatic moment for the Mueller investigation and are being eagerly awaited in Washington for signs of how the Russia drama will unfold in the weeks ahead and how much it may eventually hurt Trump.\n\nYet as with this week's feverishly anticipated sentencing memo about Trump's ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, the filings could bring a measure of disappointment to special counsel watchers if large quantities of evidence are redacted to protect ongoing investigations.\n\nEven if important context remains under seal, Mueller often delivers hints and opens loops in court documents that sketch a colorful narrative of the Russia affair, and may offer pointers of where a probe branded \"presidential harassment\" by Trump on Thursday is going.\n\nNeither of Friday's deadlines involves action implicating the President directly in any wrongdoing, more than 18 months after Mueller was chosen to find out whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian election interference in 2016.\n\nBut in recent weeks it has become clear that the special counsel is using proceedings and filings concerning key witnesses and former Trump associates to suggest a pattern of questionable behavior on the part of the President.\n\nIt's clear that Trump's behavior has worried officials at the Justice Department since nearly the start of his presidency. CNN reported Thursday on the frantic days that followed the President's firing of then-FBI Director James Comey , which led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials to view Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time. Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before Mueller was appointed, the sources said.\n\nSince then, Mueller has constructed a tapestry of disclosures that started with an accounting of a hacking operation by Moscow's intelligence agencies and has unveiled multiple links between Russians and people around Trump -- and repeated lies about those contacts.\n\nFriday's activity will end an ominous week for Trump in which it has become clear that the investigation is far broader beneath the surface than is publicly evident. Mueller can now be said to be digging into possible collusion with the Russians, obstruction of justice, contacts with Russian officials during Trump's transition, possible campaign finance violations and the President's business secrets.\n\nA frantic Friday revolving around the Russia drama also features a return to center stage by Comey, who is testifying in private to two House committees as Republicans throw their final blocks for Trump before handing over control to Democrats next month. A transcript of the encounter is expected to be released within 24 hours.\n\nAnd a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, was released from prison in Wisconsin after serving a 14-day sentence for lying to the FBI.\n\nIn another development that could affect the Mueller probe, Trump said he would nominate William Barr as attorney general to fill a post Barr also held in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Barr is seen as a mainstream choice, though has previously criticized aspects of the Russia investigation. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be responsible for overseeing the special counsel.\n\nIf that were not enough, Trump's longtime informal political adviser Roger Stone -- who is being investigated for alleged cooperation with WikiLeaks, which posted emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by Russian agents -- said he would not turn against the President.\n\n\"This is not about Russian collusion, it's about the parsing of words,\" Stone said. \"It's about process crimes and perjury traps, and I decline to participate.\"\n\n'Crimes and lies'\n\nMueller has pledged to tell the court abou t Manafort's \"crimes and lies\" t hat he said were committed after the uber-lobbyist signed a plea agreement and have sparked speculation the former campaign chairman is angling for a presidential pardon.\n\nThe disclosures from Mueller's team will be closely watched to see whether Manafort, who is at risk of spending the rest of his life in jail, lied about activity that could implicate Trump or senior campaign officials, or solely about the business interests in Ukraine that led to his downfall on fraud charges or other questions.\n\nManafort is an important witness for Mueller since he was at a notorious Trump Tower meeting in 2016 in which the candidate's son Don Jr. believed Russian intermediaries would deliver \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nHe could also be useful in establishing wheth er changes to the platform at the Republican National Convention that watered down criticism of Russia had followed requests from Moscow.\n\nLawyers for Manafort denied their client lied and will have a chance to challenge the special counsel's assertions before his sentencing date of March 5.\n\nIt is possible that some of Mueller's explanations will be blacked out, as they were in the Flynn filing. But a spokesman for the special counsel's office has said that at least some of the filing will be public.\n\nRoss Garber, a lawyer who specializes in impeachment, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday that it was not normal for a cooperation agreement to collapse in such a manner, given the intensive negotiations that typically happen beforehand.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether anything new came up that nobody expected, but it is very unusual,\" Garber said.\n\nMueller's decision to come down hard on Manafort but to offer leniency to Flynn was widely interpreted as a sign that he will reward people implicated in the investigation who are willing to tell the truth about what happened -- but will tolerate no obstruction.\n\nCohen resets his life's 'compass'\n\nCohen has asked the court for a non-custodial sentence after he admitted tax fraud and lying to Congress about Trump's business aspirations in Moscow to preserve the President's political narrative that he had no ties to Russia.\n\nCohen's lawyers said in a memo that their client -- by turning on Trump, for whom he once said he would take a bullet -- had decided to \"re-point his internal compass true north toward a productive, ethical and thoroughly law-abiding life.\"\n\nSentencing documents filed by both sides in the case have connected significant dots in the investigation.\n\nLast week, Cohen pleaded guilty to misleading lawmakers about a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which he had originally said had been shelved by January 2016.\n\nIn fact, the project was alive until June 2016, according to a statement lodged with the court by Mueller, who said Cohen had discussed the plan with Trump several times and had briefed Trump family members.\n\nThe revelations were important because Trump had insisted throughout the campaign that he had no business links with Russia.\n\nThey also raised the question of whether the President was beholden to Russia for a long period of the campaign and was shaping his complimentary statements about President Vladimir Putin to further his own financial interests.\n\nCohen has also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations connected to hush money paid to women who alleged affairs with Trump, which the President has denied.\n\n\"Michael kept his client contemporaneously informed and acted on his client's instructions,\" Cohen's lawyers wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\n\"Michael felt obligated to assist Client-1, (Trump) on Client-1's instruction, to attempt to prevent Woman-1 and Woman-2 from disseminating narratives that would adversely affect the Campaign and cause personal embarrassment to Client-1 and his family.\"\n\nCohen, who faced 46 to 63 months in jail under his original plea deal with New York prosecutors, is hoping that Mueller will grant him the same kind of favorable treatment as Flynn. The special counsel told a court this week that owing to Flynn's cooperation with the investigation, the former national security adviser should get no jail time. Redactions in documents accompanying the request made it impossible, however, to assess what that cooperation entailed and whether it put the President in any jeopardy.\n\nTrump has reacted angrily to the idea that Cohen could get a break from Mueller in return for his cooperation.\n\n\"He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence,\" the President tweeted earlier this week.\n\nDepending on the details Mueller chooses to unveil on Friday, it is almost certain that Trump's allies will reach for their familiar argument that the special counsel still has not proved any cooperation between Russia and the campaign -- the original mandate of the probe.\n\nBut with every move he makes, Mueller appears to be getting closer to the people who are closest to the President himself, so in the broadest sense there's every chance that Friday could effectively be another rough day in court for Trump.\n\nThis post has been updated to include additional developments."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The frantic scramble before Mueller got the job", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/oXTnV7JUkgE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) In the hectic eight days after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials viewed Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time.\n\nThey discussed a range of options, including the idea of Rosenstein wearing a wire while speaking with Trump, which Rosenstein later denied . Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, the sources said. The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until after Comey was fired. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, according to the sources, and also included the President's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nThe new details about the genesis of the obstruction case into Trump that became a key element of the Mueller probe shed light on the chaotic week following Comey's firing and the scramble to decide how best to respond. They also help to explain the origins of the Mueller investigation that has stretched across 19 months, consumed Trump's presidency and is building toward a dramatic day of courtroom filings on Friday.\n\nA Justice Department official strongly disputed Rosenstein sought to curb the President, emphasizing that his conversations with McCabe were simply about talking through ways to conduct the investigation. \"He never said anything like that,\" the source added.\n\nOther sources said that the FBI would only take such dramatic action if officials suspected a crime had been committed. But Rosenstein and other senior FBI officials also had deep concerns about Trump's behavior and thought he needed to be checked, according to the sources.\n\nA spokeswoman for McCabe did not provide comment for this story.\n\n\"It's shocking that the FBI would open up an obstruction case for the President exercising his authority under Article II,\" said the President's attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported last year that the obstruction investigation started before Mueller's appointment, but the sources offered a more complete picture of the drastic actions law enforcement leaders took during that feverish period.\n\nPrior to Comey's firing, top FBI officials had discussed opening an obstruction investigation based on the President saying to Comey, \"I hope you can let this go\" when discussing Flynn. That episode was later described in memos Comey wrote following the February meeting that the former FBI director would leak soon after his firing.\n\nComey's attorney did not comment for this story, but pointed to Comey's 2017 testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nComey, however, hinted at the discussion in his book.\n\n\"We resolved to figure out down the road what to do with the president's request and its implications as our investigation progressed,\" he wrote.\n\nThen, on May 9, Comey was fired.\n\nThe subsequent meetings led by Rosenstein and McCabe were held soon after the White House made clear that Rosenstein's memo addressing concerns about Comey's conduct during the Hillary Clinton probe was central to the President's decision. One of the sources likened it to \"spitballing\" about potential steps in the mold of \"What are the options. What makes sense. What doesn't?\"\n\nFor the deputy attorney general, the obstruction investigation into Trump and the appointment of the special counsel has turned his entire Justice Department tenure into an awkward role of supervising the Mueller investigation after he -- voluntarily, sources said -- wrote the memo justifying Comey's firing. Critics have argued the Comey memo makes Rosenstein a potential witness in the obstruction case\n\nTrump's ire for obstruction inquiry\n\nOne source said there were \"different conversations at different times with different people.\" The President then raised the stakes, telling NBC News in an interview that he fired Comey because of the \"Russia thing.\"\n\nAmong the ideas discussed were opening an obstruction probe and appointing a special counsel, which were ultimately done in quick succession, less than two weeks after Comey was fired. Rosenstein also raised the idea of wearing a wire while speaking with Trump and exploring whether Cabinet members would invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Those additional ideas, first reported by The New York Times , were taken seriously by some officials but did not come to pass, and one source in the room has dismissed Rosenstein's comments on the wire as sarcasm.\n\nRosenstein's original public announcement appointing the special counsel did not specifically reference the obstruction issue, only \"the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\" But the order setting up the special counsel did include the legal code that includes investigating matters related to obstruction.\n\nRosenstein has been under constant fire from Trump and a frequent target of the President's tweets, and he was prepared to be fired after his comments about wearing a wire and the 25th Amendment were reported. He survived at the Justice Department but was passed over as acting attorney general for Jeff Sessions' chief of staff Matt Whitaker, who was seen as a loyalist to Trump and has publicly criticized the special counsel's investigation.\n\nBoth McCabe and Rosenstein have felt the withering criticism of the President. Just last week, Trump tweeted out a picture of Rosenstein in prison. Asked why he did that in an interview with The New York Post, Trump responded, \"He never should have picked a special counsel.\"\n\nThis week, Rosenstein joked during a speech to \"let the President know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.\"\n\nTrump has submitted written answers to Mueller's team about potential collusion between members of Trump's team and Russian officials, but he has not answered questions from the special counsel related to obstruction. It's still not clear whether Mueller will try to seek additional written testimony or an in-person interview from Trump related to the obstruction investigation. The President's lawyers have signaled they won't answer questions on obstruction because the time period falls under executive privilege.\n\nThe push for a special counsel\n\nIn the days immediately after Comey was fired, McCabe pushed for the appointment of a special counsel but Rosenstein seemed hesitant, despite many calls to do so.\n\nOn May 11, two days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein briefed Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and the panel's top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who were running their own Russia investigation. According to contemporaneous text messages between FBI officials, \"Warner conveyed that he wanted (a) special counsel\" and Rosenstein \"said he took that under advisement.\"\n\nMcCabe and Rosenstein later met with the full \"Gang of Eight,\" the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads, the day Mueller was appointed.\n\nSeparately, Comey was orchestrating his own campaign to create public outcry for a special counsel. The former FBI director had a key memo about his interactions with Trump leaked to The New York Times, which published an article that Trump had asked Comey to go easy on Flynn on May 16. Mueller was appointed the next day.\n\nIt is not clear why the FBI first moved to open a case just before the appointment of a special counsel. However, the investigation of the President could have been seen as an impetus for having an independent team investigate given the sensitivities. At the time, those pushing for special counsel were focused on protecting the Russia investigation from further efforts by Trump to curtail it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller poised to reveal new details on Russia probe in Manafort, Cohen filings", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/mUPyNEO0dds/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's team could reveal tantalizing new details in its investigation into possible Russian collusion on Friday thanks to a pair of court filing deadlines involving President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nMueller's office has a Friday deadline to explain to the court why it accused Manafort of lying to investigators and breaking his cooperation deal. Separately, the special counsel's office and federal prosecutors in New York have to provide memos to recommend a sentence for Cohen -- filings that are expected to detail how he has cooperated in multiple investigations.\n\nThe memos from Mueller come the same week that the special counsel's office said in court Tuesday that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn provided \"substantial assistance\" to the special counsel's office and should not receive jail time.\n\nIn addition, former FBI Director James Comey is testifying behind closed doors on Friday before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees for a Republican-led probe into the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Also Friday, George Papadopoulos -- the first person to plead guilty in the Mueller probe -- is being released from prison after serving a two-week sentence.\n\nIt all adds up to one of the busiest weeks in the 19-month Mueller investigation -- and potentially one of the most revealing.\n\nManafort plea agreement\n\nManafort's plea deal was thrown for a loop last week when Mueller's team accused the ex-Trump campaign chairman of lying to them after he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy crimes and began cooperating with the Russia probe.\n\nThe special counsel must now explain exactly why it believes Manafort lied and what he lied about.\n\nThe key question is whether Manafort lied about matters related to alleged collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.\n\nManafort has extensive ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians dating back a decade and was in close contact with a Russian-intelligence linked political operative named Konstantin Kilimnik through this year. His years of earning millions from Ukrainian political consulting led to his conviction for tax fraud and banking crimes this summer. Following that conviction, Manafort admitted to several other lobbying and business crimes and agreed to help Mueller.\n\nManafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" after meeting with them several times, prosecutors alleged in a court filing last week. Manafort has disputed the accusation that he lied.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel's office has said at least part of the Manafort memo would be made public. Like in Flynn's case earlier this week, some of it could be sealed if the details would reveal parts of still-ongoing investigations.\n\nCohen sentencing memo\n\nThe special counsel could also reveal new information about its investigation when it provides a memo Friday recommending a sentence for Cohen.\n\nCohen's case took a twist last week when he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent of talks with Trump involving Trump Tower Moscow, which he had said ended in January 2016. In fact, discussions about the project went as late as June 2016, his plea revealed, and Cohen said in court that he lied \"out of loyalty to Individual-1,\" a reference to Trump.\n\nCohen already pleaded guilty earlier this year to eight counts in a separate case from the Manhattan US attorney's office. As part of his plea deal with that office, Cohen faced a likely sentence of 46 to 63 months in prison, but his newly minted cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors may substantially reduce that.\n\nCohen, who is set to be sentenced in both the special counsel and Manhattan US attorney cases on December 12, asked a judge last week for no prison time. While he pleaded guilty to tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations connected to hush-money payments to women who claimed affairs with Trump, Cohen's lawyers said has earned leniency because of his cooperation with multiple federal and state investigations.\n\nCohen's attorneys wrote that he sat for seven voluntary interviews with the special counsel and continues to make himself available as needed.\n\nHis cooperation has sparked a backlash from Trump, who slammed Cohen in a tweet this week and said Cohen should \"serve a full and complete sentence.\"\n\nMueller recommends no jail for Flynn\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller's team released some new details about its investigation when it recommended no jail time for Flynn -- but also left a lot to the imagination with lengthy redactions detailing the \"substantial assistance\" Flynn gave to the Justice Department.\n\nMueller's sentencing memo stated that Flynn had been interviewed 19 times, and he provided information for at least three investigations. But details of some of the investigations were completely redacted in the document, beyond stating that one was a \"criminal investigation.\"\n\n\"While this addendum seeks to provide a comprehensive description of the benefit the government has thus far obtained from the defendant's substantial assistance, some of that benefit may not be fully realized at this time because the investigations in which he has provided assistance are ongoing,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nStill, prosecutors said Flynn's early cooperation was \"particularly valuable\" because of his insight and the fact his cooperation encouraged others to talk as well.\n\nFlynn was Trump's first national security adviser, but was fired less than a month into his tenure over misleading the White House about his discussions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in December 2017. He will be sentenced on December 18."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Rex Tillerson just exposed Donald Trump's greatest weakness", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GEs2E_oioIc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Since being fired by President Donald Trump as secretary of state, Rex Tillerson has kept a very low profile. But on Thursday night in Houston, Tillerson broke that silence in a big way.\n\nHere's how he described the \"why\" behind the breakdown of his relationship with the President, according to the Houston Chronicle\n\n\"So often, the President would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it and I would have to say to him, Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can't do it that way. It violates the law.\"\n\nUm, what???\n\nThe President of the United States would tell the secretary of state how he wanted things done and the secretary of state would have to tell him it couldn't be done the way he wanted because that was illegal?\n\nThis is all fine!\n\nWhat's scary about Tillerson's admission? A few things.\n\n1) Trump either doesn't know the law or doesn't care about the law\n\n2) This isn't the first time we've heard of this sort of I-am-the-law, Judge Dredd-like behavior from the President.\n\nTime and time again -- particularly in his interactions with the Justice Department -- Trump has shown that he has zero understanding of the limits of his job.\n\nTillerson described Trump as \"a man who's undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things but rather says 'this is what I believe.'\"\n\nThat approach is broadly in keeping with Trump's experience in the private sector. In business, he largely did what he wanted -- rules (and consequences) be damned. If things went bad, the penalty, usually, was bankruptcy -- and Trump believed he could just deal and talk his way out of that sort of thing.\n\nTrump has never understood the distinctions between being the head (figurehead, some would say) of a company and being the President of the United States. In his dealings with Sessions -- and Tillerson -- Trump's assumption is that they will do whatever he tells them to do because, well, he's the boss.\n\nThe idea that Tillerson, Sessions and the rest of the administration ultimately serve a) the people of the country and b) the rule of law is seemingly lost on Trump.\n\nNeed more evidence? Trump never forgave Sessions for recusing himself from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Why? \"Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the President,\" Trump told The New York Times in July 2017 . \"It's extremely unfair -- and that's a mild word -- to the President.\"\n\nThat Sessions recused himself to prevent any perception of bias in the investigation -- you know, for the good of the country and all that -- was totally lost on Trump. His only reaction to the situation was: This is bad for me, and so Sessions shouldn't have done it.\n\nWhich, really, says it all.\n\nTrump's total ignorance of the law -- whether willful or just from sheer obtuseness -- is, at this point, a defining characteristic of his presidency. He simply doesn't get that there are limits on his power, limits put in place to preserve the office of the presidency -- and the broader institutions of our democracy."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC.

It is also now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nOn average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August, has a case fatality rate of 57%.\n\nThe ministry also reported that 149 people have recovered. However, 44 health workers have been infected with the virus, of whom 12 have died.\n\nNorth Kivu province, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organization. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\n\"Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge,\" WHO said in a report Thursday.\n\nWHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.\n\nGender imbalance\n\nWomen and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August.

One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.

It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area.

led to an \"inaccurate\" story about federal funding of controversial fetal tissue research, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.\n\nHHS's National Institutes of Health has made no decision on whether to extend a University of California, San Francisco contract for controversial research involving fetal tissue, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS.\n\nHer statement contradicts Washington Post reporting Tuesday that the \"Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract\" with UCSF to test new treatments for HIV.\n\nAccording to the Post, an anonymous source said a National Institutes of Health official told a UCSF investigator that the decision to end a seven-year contract before its completion was coming from the \"highest levels.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Washington Post chose to report assertions that are completely false,\" Oakley said.\n\nOakley said that there were \"no traceable records\" proving these claims made by the Post's anonymous source and that \"multiple, on-the-record assurances from senior officials at both the National Institutes of Health and in the Office of the Secretary\" told the Post that the claims were incorrect.\n\nThe Post also reported that a letter from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the contract would continue for 90 days rather than the expected year-long renewal.\n\n\"No contracting official would have had the authority to impart any communication to UCSF that the contract was being cancelled because no decision has been made,\" Oakley said.\n\nRenate Myles, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said on Thursday that \"NIH did, however, send a letter to UCSF to notify them of our intent to ensure continuity of service for 90 days while the audit continues and until a final decision is made on the contract.\"\n\nDoan would not comment, though she said the \"research is conducted in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as ethical standards.\"\n\nOakley emphasized that \"a decision will be made when the contract has been reviewed, pursuant to the ongoing audit/review process\" initiated by the HHS in September\n\nThe battle over human fetal tissue research\n\nTwo months ago, the HHS did terminate a contract: one struck between the Food and Drug Administration (an agency within the HHS) and a biotech company that was slated to provide about $16,000 of human fetal tissue for federal research.\n\nThe FDA explained in a notice posted online that \"fresh human tissues are required\" to create mice with human immune systems, which is necessary when testing drugs \"for safety and efficacy.\"\n\nHowever, a response letter from more than 80 House Republications to the FDA called for the cancellation of this federal contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.\n\nIn September, the HHS not only terminated the contract, it stated that \"in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,\" it had \"initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\" while \"continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\"\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is obtained through elective abortions and is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows . Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration.

But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness \"probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion\".\n\nHe also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nSir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more \"risk averse\" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment.

Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.\n\n\"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.\n\nA previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nJust yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers.\n\nWhile some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development.\n\n\"For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Mom Sends Blurry, Indistinct Photo Of Computer Screen Showing Boots You Might Like", "article_link": "https://local.theonion.com/mom-sends-blurry-indistinct-photo-of-computer-screen-s-1830943549", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "CAPITOLA, CA\u2014Claiming that the footwear in question would go nicely with a lot of things in your wardrobe, your mother sent you a blurry and indistinct photo of her home computer screen Friday ostensibly displaying a pair of boots you might like. \u201cI was looking at the internet and thought of you when I saw these on the Amazon\u2019s website.

Ultimate is a fun, but undeniably compromised gaming experience. Ultimate pulls out all the stops to gives fans the biggest, most finely tuned Smash Bros. experience to date. It\u2019s a tight, balanced, action-packed brawler filled out with over 70 of your favorite Nintendo characters and dozens of classic stages from the series\u2019 history. However, this dedication to representing the entire Nintendo universe ends up sinking the game due to the completely unforgivable inclusion of Kirby, who is one of the most offensive and harmful stereotypes in the history of popular entertainment.\n\nThis is 2018, and grotesque caricatures like Kirby have no place in video games. Some will certainly quibble with this complaint; they will say that this is just a game and no place for politics, but witnessing depictions like Kirby detracts from the entire gaming experience. What should be an absorbing, accessible party game for players of all ages and skill levels turns into a disrespectful and disgusting mockery the second we see Kirby suck Mario into his puffy pink cheeks and absorb his powers. It renders an otherwise well-crafted product nearly unplayable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inclusion of Kirby is such a shame because there are moments of real enjoyment here. Smash Bros. Ultimate maintains the frenetic, zany fighting antics that are the staple of the franchise, with the plethora of characters offering a wide variety of combat styles and strategies. The deep rule customization and the borderline overwhelming number of levels guarantee you will be able to find a rich variety of play that satisfies almost everyone. Yet this commitment to an inclusive experience falls apart the second Kirby lands on screen, riding a star and waving his little marshmallow arms like he\u2019s emerged directly from a bigoted 1930s cartoon. It\u2019s not just insulting, it\u2019s lazy. Including Kirby shows Nintendo simply isn\u2019t interested in doing the work to bring real characters to their games.\n\nWhat we see in our entertainment matters. Kirby does so much harm because these kinds of depictions influence the way someone is treated and seen. Creators, including game developers, have a responsibility to consider the impact they are having on society, which is why the inclusion of an outdated and cruel stereotype like Kirby is a disgrace, plain and simple. Seeing images like this holds society back and limits opportunity\u2014people internalize the image of Kirby putting on a chef\u2019s hat and stirring all his enemies into a giant, bubbling cauldron, even if they are consumed in a silly entertainment context.\n\nJust look at this clip of Kirby in action.\n\nHow a backwards, demeaning image like this made it into a game in 2018 is beyond me. It just goes to show that developers come from a privileged and insulated world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven worse, Kirby has been made the poster boy for the Smash Bros.\u2019 new \u201cWorld of Light\u201d mode. In it, you traverse a game board, gradually unlocking other characters by winning battles, often with unique challenges, and freeing spirits which can be used to grant power-ups to the player. It\u2019s a great addition to the franchise and really fleshes out the single-player component of the game, but in starting the adventure, the first and only playable character is Kirby, meaning anyone who wants to experience the main portion of the single-player game is forced to contend with this monstrous display of ignorance and hateful clich\u00e9s. Surely, Nintendo will put out some statement saying they value representation, and that Kirby was meant to be depicted as the hero, but putting him front-and-center in \u201cWorld of Light\u201d is the worst kind of tokenism.\n\nThis isn\u2019t some small blind spot: Kirby has been seen as the poster boy of intolerant characterization for years. This squishy, big-eyed sphere of a character, floating through the air and crushing people after turning into a stone was a despicable product of a bygone era. For him to be featured without any changes in a modern game is a travesty. The damage he has done is beyond measure. We are supposed to be better than Kirby now, but clearly some of us haven\u2019t gotten the message. How did this go through multiple levels of approval? Surely, one person at Nintendo must have pointed out how appalling Kirby is.\n\nSome people will say that Kirby is just meant to be a fun and goofy character. Others will say we\u2019ve made so much progress and we should celebrate that instead of focusing on one small mistake, but the wounds inflicted by this stereotype are very real and very deep. Images of Kirby still pervade our culture, pushing the idea of a simple-minded blob inhaling everything in its path, notions that have a long history of being used to demean and dismiss, causing so much violence and suffering. And, of course, some people don\u2019t even see anything wrong with showing a pink fluff-ball pulling out a mallet and knocking someone across a screen. Those people are probably too far gone to reach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf games are going to be taken seriously as an art form, they have to be held to the same standards as movies and television, where something like Kirby would have been dismissed as a laughably outdated stereotype decades ago. We can\u2019t just focus on a game\u2019s graphics or replay value while Kirby pile-drives turtles and inhales princesses like it\u2019s the 19th century. We worked for years to move beyond Kirby. If we let publishers get away with these reprehensible images, then what were all the marches for? What did previous generations fight for if not to put an end to this? We as a gaming community need to speak out. We need to show Nintendo that we won\u2019t stand for it and will not buy their games if they continue to include Kirby.\n\nI occasionally had fun with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but I could never lose myself in the game with Kirby sitting there like a smiling, pink encapsulation of human hate and bigotry. It ruined what should have been a lighthearted and enjoyable experience. We need to do better than Kirby, and until game studios realize, that I cannot in good conscience support what they publish."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Michigan GOP Passes Legislation Rerouting Flint Drinking Water To Governor\u2019s Mansion For Incoming Democrat", "article_link": "https://politics.theonion.com/michigan-gop-passes-legislation-rerouting-flint-drinkin-1830941549", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

There could be people stuck while trying to get to shops, schools and hospitals,\" Collor says.\n\nHis fears don't appear to be without foundation.\n\nKent County Council, the regional authority, has suggested traffic problems spawned by a no-deal Brexit could create a series of grim knock-on effects, including disruption to waste collection services and the transportation of dead bodies to post mortem or storage facilities.\n\nUK Finance Minister Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has warned it could take at least two years to get Dover's infrastructure ready for a no-deal scenario.\n\nA Brexit bellwether\n\n181201182945771\n\nBut if Dover is a bellwether case for possible outcomes of a no-deal Brexit, it is certainly not the only part of the UK that is projected to be negatively affected by such a divorce.\n\nIn fact, according to official estimates, the entire country would be worse off.\n\nThe Bank of England, the UK's central bank, has warned that leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement could cause the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to shrink by up to eight percent.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, forecasts a potential economic slump of more than nine percent in a no-deal scenario.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, for its part, says leaving the EU in a disorderly fashion would have \"substantial costs for the UK economy\".\n\nExperts say such bleak predictions are accurate and would play out alongside capital flight, widespread business closures and heightened unemployment.\n\n\"The impact of a no-deal Brexit would be very severe. The EU is the UK's main trading partner,\" Professor Aditya Goenka, chair in economics at the University of Birmingham, says.\n\n\"If we look at the impact it could have on GDP within the UK \u2026 this is equivalent to the entire northwest, including the cities of Manchester and Liverpool, just shutting down,\" he adds.\n\n\"This could be worse economically for the UK than the global financial crisis [of 2008].\"\n\nAccusations of fearmongering\n\nOthers, however, argue that the warnings issued about no-deal's impact on Dover and other parts of the UK amount to little more than blatant fearmongering designed to derail the entire Brexit process.\n\nDebbie Lane, the 59-year-old owner of a local pub, is one.\n\n\"Why would there be backlogs? Before we joined the EU, when we had customs and imports and exports clerks, things worked,\" Lane says.\n\n\"No-deal is better than a deal where we are held to ransom by the EU again, which I do feel we have been. Locally, we don't benefit from the EU. Everyone just comes and goes straight through this town. Nobody stops here.\"\n\nSince joining the European Economic Community in 1973, Britain has intertwined itself with its European partners into a single market, which allows people, goods, services and money to move freely within the bloc in return for adherence to common rules and regulations.\n\nBut critics, such as Lane, argue that has meant ceding too much sovereignty to the EU. Like her, many Dover residents feel aggrieved by Brussels' perceived influence and want out of its orbit.\n\nDuring the UK's June 2016 referendum, more than 62 percent of the area's voters opted to get out of the EU, 10 percent higher than the overall leave vote nationwide.\n\nIt isn't just a section of the local community casting aspersions over warnings about Dover's future should the UK fully sever ties with the EU, however.\n\nJulian Jessop, chief economist at the UK-based Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank, has suggested that threats of \"substantial disruption\" at the town's port in the event of a no-deal Brexit are \"exaggerated\".\n\nJessop says it is unlikely that most trucks arriving from the EU would straightaway be subject to the same checks as those from countries outside of the bloc for three reasons.\n\nOne, because laws don't necessarily demand so; two, UK and European authorities would pursue mutually beneficial economic cooperation; and finally, there would be a lack of manpower to carry out inspections on such a scale.\n\n'Uneasiness over the unknown'\n\nDisputes over how Dover would fare in a the event of a no-deal departure from the EU form just one part of the wider Brexit discussions dominating public and political life in the UK.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed withdrawal deal, brokered after months of negotiations with EU leaders, has attracted vociferous criticism from across the political spectrum.\n\nIf approved by the UK parliament in a crucial vote next week, the withdrawal agreement would end uncertainty over a possible no-deal departure.\n\nBut the deal is likely to be roundly rejected, thereby continuing the uncertainty of the shape of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\n\nIn Dover, that unpredictability means more anxiety for Collor.\n\n\"There is an uneasiness over the unknown ... Dover is going to get hit, somehow, it's just a matter of how we control the flow of traffic to keep the town going,\" he says.\n\n\"We only want to know what's going to happen. You can't plan if you don't know what you're planning against.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "How Facebook spurred the 'yellow vest' protests", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/facebook-spurred-yellow-vest-protests-181207171656214.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "France will have 89,000 police officers on duty across the country on Saturday as part of exceptional security measures ahead of more anti-government protests that have swelled in size, spurred by the attention organisers got on social media.\n\nMedia academics say that demonstrators feel Facebook is the real expression of the people.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

It is a collaboration between the Nippon Foundation and GEBCO, a nonprofit association of experts that is already involved in charting the ocean floor.\n\nThe result would be greater knowledge of the oceans\u2019 biodiversity, improved understanding of the climate, advanced warning of impending disasters, and the ability to better protect or exploit deep-sea resources, Hasebe said.\n\n\u200bRecent advances\n\nSo far, the biggest data contributors to Seabed 2030 have been companies, in particular Dutch energy prospector Fugro and deep-sea mapping firm Ocean Infinity. Both were involved in the search for the Malaysian airliner MH370, which disappeared in 2014.\n\nTo map the ocean floor, high-tech multibeam echosounders transmit a fan of acoustic beams from a ship, which ping back depending on the depth and topography of the ocean floor. That creates data points, which can be converted into a map.\n\n\u201cWith advanced sonar technology, it really is like seeing. I think we\u2019ve come out of the era of being the blind man with the stick,\u201d said Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n\u201cWe can survey much more efficiently, and, not only that, but in much greater detail,\u201d he said, adding that the work was painstaking. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s a big place!\u201d he said.\n\nThe advent of new technology, such as underwater drones and robots, is also speeding up the mapping process.\n\nA global competition hosted by energy giant Shell, the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, is also under way, offering $7 million to teams that can develop technologies to conduct ocean exploration autonomously, rapidly and to a high resolution.\n\nA team from Seabed 2030 has reached the final stages of the competition with an idea based on remotely operated robots working in extreme depths to map territory independently.\n\nEconomic benefits\n\nExploring Earth\u2019s final frontier will do more than satisfy scientific curiosity, it should bring economic benefits, too.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the world\u2019s trade is carried by sea, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a U.N. body, making safe navigation a key motivator for mapping.\n\n\u201cIf a ship runs aground it\u2019s a terrible day for the economy, it\u2019s a terrible day for the environment and it\u2019s a bad day for the captain, too,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nSeabed 2030\u2019s map would have other benefits, experts said: In a warming world, it would provide a better idea of sea levels as ice melts and, importantly, warn about impending tsunamis that could devastate coastal communities.\n\nThey said it would also help the so-called \u201cblue economy\u201d as countries and companies seek to protect or exploit deep-sea resources, from exploring for oil and gas to installing wind farms or laying fiber-optic cables for the internet.\n\nThat is predicted to become more important in the coming years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It expects the ocean economy to contribute $3 trillion to the world economy by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2010.\n\nPolitical rifts\n\nSome parts of the oceans \u2014 the East Coast of the United States, areas around Japan, New Zealand and Ireland \u2014 are relatively well-mapped, experts said. Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans \u2014 mapping will take center stage during negotiations to be completed by 2020, as nations create a new, legally binding treaty to protect the high seas.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits to knowing more about the ocean floor,\u201d Hasebe said. \u201cHumanity as a whole would be able to benefit.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Australian Bid for Encrypted Data Passes First Hurdle", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-bid-for-encrypted-data-passes-first-hurdle/4688991.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "The Australian parliament\u2019s lower house Thursday passed a bill to force tech firms such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook and Apple to give police access to encrypted data, pushing it closer to becoming a precedent-setting law.\n\nHowever, the proposal, staunchly opposed by the tech giants because Australia is seen as a test case as other nations explore similar rules, faces a sterner test in the upper house Senate, where privacy and information security concerns are sticking points.\n\nThe bill provides for fines of up to A$10 million ($7.3 million) for institutions and prison terms for individuals for failing to hand over data linked to suspected illegal activities.\n\nLabor party concerns\n\nEarlier in the week it appeared set to secure enough support from both major political parties, with some amendments, to secure passage.

Yet while the country is scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019, Britain is as divided over the issue as it ever has been.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has agreed the terms of the \u2018divorce\u2019 with the leaders of the EU\u2019s remaining member states, but lawmakers in the British parliament still have to approve the so-called Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nIn ordinary times, a Conservative government with a simple majority would be able to get the deal through the House of Commons with little fuss.\n\nBut these are extraordinary times. May cannot rely on the support from members of parliament in her own party \u2013 much less Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been propping up May\u2019s minority government since her disastrous general election last year.\n\nPress Association Will Theresa May quit? Could Jeremy Corbyn become Prime Minister?\n\nAs it stands, as May bizarrely takes her Brexit plan around the country as if on the election trail, no commentator in the country expects the prime minister to get enough support when MPs vote on December 11. The only question, it seems, is how heavily she is defeated.\n\nThen what? That\u2019s where things get more unpredictable, with the outcomes ranging wildly from the prospect of another general election to no Brexit at all.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to what will be a historic week in British politics, however it ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nOn Tuesday, MPs began five days of debates ahead of what is described as the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement they are debating outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. The vote is expected on December 11, but even that isn\u2019t set in stone. Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\n\nWill May get enough votes?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSome 20 Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against May\u2019s deal, 45 have said they will not vote in favour and more than 20 have said they are unhappy with it. Their unease comes from, as they see it, the agreement aligning the UK too closely with the EU, and they claim May is set to deliver a Brexit in name only.\n\nGiven that May doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament, she will be relying on support from opposition parties. May\u2019s minority government ally, the DUP, who usually vote with the government to help them pass legislation, has also expressed its own concerns with how the deal risks separating the island of Ireland from the mainland as a trading territory.\n\nThe Labour Party, the official opposition, has also declined to approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the have concerns about the impact on jobs and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe bottom line is this: the chance of the deal being approved with the simple majority of 320 of the 639 MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat are the amendments?\n\nThe vote - or votes - may not be limited to the terms of May\u2019s deal. Labour has tabled an amendment outlining how MPs will \u201cpursue every option\u201d that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of May\u2019s deal or leaving without any deal at all.\n\nTory and Labour backbenchers have also put forward something similar, and there appears to be united front against the UK quitting the EU without any deal - or what is colloquially referred to as \u2018crashing out\u2019.\n\nIndeed, on the first day of debates, MPs voted for a motion that means if May\u2019s Brexit is voted down next week, MPs can effectively instruct ministers on what to do next and amend her \u201cplan B\u201d option.\n\nPress Association\n\nWhat happens if she wins the vote?\n\nIn the unlikely event that scores of MPs from across the political spectrum swing behind the embattled prime minister, it will allow the government to introduce the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to the Commons either before Christmas or after recess (the holiday for parliament), in January.\n\nWhile no guarantee of the legislation passing, it would suggest an orderly procession towards the EU exit doors.\n\nWhat happens if she loses the vote?\n\nYou would expect Theresa May\u2019s premiership to be over, right? While that\u2019s a likely outcome, it is not the only one. These are the most likely scenarios.\n\n\u2013 She could try again\n\nThis would depend on the margin of her defeat.\n\nThe European Union has been adamant this is a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 deal that cannot be renegotiated. But if faced with the threat of a calamitous no-deal Brexit and following a narrow Commons defeat, May might fancy testing their resolve and seeing if she can get at least some cosmetic changes to appease enough MPs to win a second vote.\n\n\u2013 Theresa May quits\n\nMay herself has been adamant that she will stay on as prime minister regardless of the result. But a defeat by something in the order of 200 votes - which would represent a rebellion by scores of her own MPs - and it could be the most elegant way out.\n\n\u2013 May forced out by a Conservative rebellion\n\nConservative MPs most strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal have already failed to oust May, struggling to muster enough support to trigger a leadership battle two weeks ago. But once the vote is over, other disgruntled Tory politicians could make their move.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum\n\nYes, taking the deal to the public is an option. May has ruled it out, and Labour has backed the idea - but only if they do not get a general election. It would possibly require an extension to the two-year timeframe to agree a Brexit deal, but even a senior Conservative has suggested another referendum could logistically be held by the end of May (the month, that is).\n\n\u2013 May calls another general election\n\nThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass. The Prime Minister could hope that voters will - via the ballot box - back her plan. Her fellow Conservatives are anxious to avoid this route after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament and a resurgent Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 Labour tries to force an election"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "CFO Of China's Huawei Technologies Arrested In Canada", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meng-wanzhou-cfo-huawei-arrested_us_5c08be89e4b069028dc675d3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian authorities said Wednesday that they have arrested the chief financial officer of China\u2019s Huawei Technologies for possible extradition to the United States.\n\nChina demanded her immediate release, and a former Canadian envoy to China warned the case might lead to retaliation by the Chinese against American and Canadian executives.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Ian McLeod said Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Saturday.\n\nThe arrest took place on the same day Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss the trade war after the close of the G-20 summit in Argentina.

It would have existed in a world where a president toured a federal prison to show the humanity of those we imprison, not our current situation where the president encourages chants of \u201clock her up.\u201d It would have been in place in a world where the Holder Memo instructed assistant United States attorneys to seek only fair and appropriate sentences, and not our current situation where the Sessions Memo requires them to seek the harshest possible punishment.\n\nInstead of a time when the federal government showed a real interest in holding law enforcement accountable, we are now at a moment when all accountability mechanisms are being torn down. From removing accountability over local law enforcement\u2019s use of militarized equipment to promoting private prisons to the end of clemency as we know it, the current administration is ignoring facts and finding ways to be even harsher to people in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe reforms of the Obama administration helped lead to some of the lowest crime rates that this country had seen in decades. And the facts show that the current administration\u2019s reforms are not making law enforcement officers any safer. If one looks at the current state of the criminal justice system, one will see how silly and hyperbolic it is to claim that signing the First Step Act could come close to making the current president the \u201cuniter in chief\u201d on criminal justice.\n\nEven supporters recognize that the sentencing reforms in the First Step Act may affect only a couple thousand of the 181,000 people currently in federal custody. I see the short-term gains as much smaller and the long-term losses as much greater.\n\nI realize my position puts me at odds with many of my friends on both the left and the right in the criminal justice reform movement. They argue that many of these reforms would improve opportunities for a few thousand people and that is enough. But even supporters recognize that the sentencing reforms in the First Step Act may affect only a couple thousand of the 181,000 people currently in federal custody. I see the short-term gains as much smaller and the long-term losses as much greater.\n\nFirst, most of the gains in this law are dependent on people applying for retroactive treatment under the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the racially charged sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. While a couple thousand individuals can apply, there is no guarantee that any significant number of people will get meaningfully shorter sentences. Virtually all of the reforms in the First Step Act require that we blindly trust this administration\u2019s law-and-order prosecutors, Bureau of Prisons employees, judges, and even appointees to the Sentencing Commission to make an effort to reduce sentences and improve conditions.\n\nSecond, a number of the talking points \u2015 no shackles for pregnant inmates and no solitary for juveniles \u2015 similarly affect a relatively small number of inmates and the attorney general could have already eliminated these poor policy decisions without any legislation, just as the Obama administration had done. If the current administration really cared about re-entry, it could show this by not senselessly destroying the re-entry efforts of the prior administration.\n\nThird, once the First Step Act is passed, there are not going to be any additional steps on the federal level anytime soon. The legislators who barely support criminal justice reform are not going to feel any need to address it again once they can point to their vote in favor of the First Step Act.\n\nThe 2015 SRCA, which already cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 15-5 vote last Congress and was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to save more than $700 million over 10 years, should be the starting point for discussions on any criminal justice reform legislation. With Democratic leadership in the House coming soon, something even more ambitious should be our target. If the Senate refuses to move on it, then let the many new governors continue to do great things on criminal justice reform, which is going to positively affect more people anyway, and let criminal justice reform be a federal campaign issue in 2020."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump Announces William Barr As Attorney General Nominee", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/william-barr-attorney-general-trump_us_5c0a8560e4b04046345b936b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump confirmed Friday that he plans to nominate William Barr as attorney general, after pushing out Jeff Sessions last month.\n\nTrump initially replaced Sessions with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, whose appointment came under scrutiny amid questions of its legality.\n\nBarr previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W.

Participants in so-called health care share ministries, which are generally cheaper than regular insurance, make monthly contributions to help pay the health care bills of other members. In return, they receive help when they need it.\n\n\n\nHealth care share ministries have grown steadily since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 and required that all Americans enroll in health insurance plans that provided a comprehensive set of benefits detailed in the law. Many members praise the share ministries for their fellowship and as a cheap alternative to paying premiums for commercial health insurance.\n\n\n\nCliff McManis, pastor of Grace Bible Fellowship in Sunnyvale, California, said the option has worked perfectly for his family.\n\n\n\nWhen his family health insurance premiums climbed to about $1,600 a month five years ago, he decided to sign up with Samaritan Ministries, one of the largest sharing ministries in the country.\n\nMcManis, married with four children, says his monthly sharing payments have never exceeded about $450 a month, and he\u2019s been content with the coverage, which has included payments for his son\u2019s surgery for a broken nose and his wife\u2019s recent surgery to remove a tumor in her belly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a hundred percent satisfied,\u201d he said, adding that the prayers offered by members who sent money meant a lot to his family. \u201cThose prayers are probably the biggest encouragement we received,\u201d he said, \u201cand we value that.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut many health care experts warn that members risk being crushed by unforeseen medical bills, and that the growing popularity of the ministries could end up burdening people who don\u2019t participate.\n\n\n\nIn areas where the ministries are especially popular, they might siphon enough healthy people out of the local insurance market to increase premiums, said JoAnn Volk, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms and co-author of an August 2018 brief on health care sharing ministries from the Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy foundation.\n\n\n\nThe ministries are not considered health insurance because, unlike insurance, members are not guaranteed that their claims will be paid. Neither the ministries nor their members assume the financial liability of other members. Participants are not precluded from also having health insurance policies, but the ministries say it\u2019s unlikely that many do.\n\n\n\nWhat gets covered as a \u201cshareable\u201d expense is usually far less comprehensive than what is required by law for health insurance. For example, share ministries often do not cover preventive health care, medicines for chronic conditions, mental health care or treatments arising from \u201cnon-biblical lifestyles,\u201d such as maternity care for out-of-wedlock pregnancies or substance abuse. They do not pay for abortions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is lousy coverage,\u201d Volk said.\n\nFirst Appeared in 1981\n\nThe first formal health care sharing organization didn\u2019t make an appearance until 1981. That\u2019s when the nonprofit Christian Healthcare Ministries in Ohio was formed. It purportedly remains one of the largest share ministries, although it doesn\u2019t disclose membership numbers.\n\n\n\nAt least 104 health care sharing ministries now operate in the United States, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. Only seven open membership to all comers rather than those from certain denominations or churches. All are Christian. There is no evidence of Jews or Muslims having similar organizations in the United States.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the larger ministries claim to operate in all 50 states, but the alliance says half of the U.S. membership is concentrated in 10 states: California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\n\n\nThe ministries say membership grew steadily after the passage of the ACA, which specifically exempted people belonging to organizations in which members \u201cshare a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs and without regard to the State in which a member resides or is employed.\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the health care sharing ministries were not subject to the penalties levied on those failing to be in an ACA-compliant health plan.\n\n\n\nCongress eliminated that exemption, however, effective next year.\n\n\n\nThe ministries grew from under 200,000 members before the ACA to about a million today, the Commonwealth Fund report says, but those numbers are based on self-reporting.\n\n\n\nThere is little confirmed data about either the membership levels of the largely unregulated organizations or the amount of money they disburse and for which services.\n\n\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries says on its website that its \u201cmembers have shared over $3.5 billion in each other\u2019s healthcare costs\u201d over 35 years.\n\nThirty states passed so-called safe harbor laws for the ministries, stating that they are not insurance companies and are therefore exempt from insurance regulations. But the remaining states do not regulate them either.\n\nBecause the ministries are exempt from insurance regulations, the only recourse members have is to file complaints with state attorneys general. But in their survey of states, authors of the Commonwealth Fund report say even the authority of the attorneys general is limited.\n\nThe large ministries all have internal appeals processes, but members have no recourse to go to court to challenge denials.\n\n\u201cWe tell people that if they have a problem, we can\u2019t help you and the courts can\u2019t help you,\u201d said Martin Swanson, administrator for health policy at the Nebraska Department of Insurance.\n\nShared Values\n\nThe ministries require members to agree to a set of shared values. Solidarity HealthShare, a Catholic-oriented health care sharing ministry with 6,000 members, for example, states, \u201cOur core beliefs are rooted in Sacred Scripture and the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nMost require members to adhere to \u201cvirtuous lifestyles,\u201d which, for Samaritan Ministries, a big ministry with 258,000 members, means no excessive drinking, tobacco and illegal drugs. They also have to attend church at least three out of four weeks and abstain from sex outside of marriage or with someone of the same gender.\n\nAll the ministries say they are rooted in biblical calls to serve fellow humans. \u201cIt\u2019s there in Romans 12,\u201d said Anthony Hopp, a vice president with Samaritan: \u201cBe devoted to one another in love.\u201d\n\nSome of the ministries automatically deduct membership fees from members\u2019 accounts and then disburse the money to needy members. Others instruct members to send checks directly to the other members, which they then verify. Payments may go directly to providers or toward reimbursement of members.\n\n\u201cWe know our contribution is going directly to certain people,\u201d said Kellie Soper of Tempe, Arizona, a tutor whose family has been in a health care sharing ministry since 2016. \u201cWhereas with insurance, it\u2019s just going to some company\u2019s profit.\u201d\n\nThe ministries also place other limits on what constitutes a shareable medical expense. Some do not take people with pre-existing conditions unless they have been symptom-free for a period.\n\nFor example, Christian Healthcare, Christian Care Ministry\u2019s Medi-Share and Samaritan do not cover routine preventive care, such as physicals, mammograms and colonoscopies. Christian Healthcare and Medi-Share do not cover mental health. Several cover prescriptions but only for a limited time.\n\nRichard Gundling, senior vice president of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, an association of financial managers of healthcare organizations, said that most providers are comfortable working with the ministries.\n\nAnd for members of a certain bent, the ministries are a way to meld religious belief with medical necessity."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Tumblr's Plan To Make The Internet Safer Will Make The World More Dangerous For Me", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-tumblr-ban-sex-work-porn_us_5c09af57e4b04046345a86b1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Tumblr, a site long known for its independent creative communities, has announced it will be banning adult content on Dec. 17 \u2014 which happens to be the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers, a day set aside to memorialize the many losses felt by a particularly at-risk community.\n\nIt can\u2019t be stated clearly enough: Tumblr\u2019s ban on porn will harm sex workers and other queer communities. Taken as part of an overall anti-sex, pro-censorship trend currently racking the internet, it\u2019s even more frightening.\n\nI\u2019m a sex worker, erotic content creator and a longtime Tumblr user. I started using the platform around the time of its launch in 2007. I went to the site to find poetry and art I appreciated, but I also discovered a vibrant queer community that flourished there. Through Tumblr, I learned words to explain my sexuality and gender identity. As I grew older and started my career, I began using Tumblr to promote my sex work, specifically my porn.\n\nIt breaks my heart that the platform which gave me a safe space to explore my sexuality is now reinforcing the stigma and shame sex workers face daily.\n\nSex work is not easy work. We face high levels of violence (including from law enforcement), difficulties finding acceptance in our personal life (even suffering bans from dating apps) and a lack of access to basic resources like bank accounts. Tumblr was a place I could safely promote my content, earn money and form a community that became almost like family.\n\nIt breaks my heart that the platform that gave me a safe space to explore my sexuality and helped me cultivate a sense of pride in my identity as a queer person and a sex worker is now reinforcing the stigma and shame sex workers face daily.\n\n\n\nTumblr\u2019s announcement comes two weeks after the discovery of child pornography on the site. While it\u2019s a noble endeavor to want to eliminate illegal content on their site, there is little evidence to suggest that overbroad algorithm-based bans of adult content are an effective way to combat sexual exploitation. Aside from the many false positives already flagged, experts have noted that pushing legitimate content creators off the public internet doesn\u2019t eliminate the illegal content, it simply makes bad actors harder to find.\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images International Women's Day in Toulouse, France, on March 8.\n\nUnfortunately, legislation like FOSTA/SESTA (which was passed earlier this year) was written to encourage such broad crackdowns on adult material, allowing sites to absolve themselves of responsibility by using automated banning mechanisms. Websites can find themselves at increased legal risk if they try to craft policies that require individual and nuanced attention. These automated banning policies make it harder for consensual workers to safely conduct their business, report abuse and share safety resources that can help trafficking victims.\n\nRather than distancing themselves from all sexual content, society would be better served by tech companies working alongside sex workers, who are natural experts and allies in the fight against exploitation and continuously work to improve harm reduction resources in their communities. Sex workers can recommend policies that will help protect their safety, including devising reporting systems specifically to deal with harassment, violence, underage content or forced labor.\n\nSociety would be better served by tech companies working alongside sex workers, who are natural experts and allies in the fight against exploitation.\n\nWe know better than anyone the downsides and challenges of the job, and we know that those should never be faced by minors. Many of us have been victims of abuse at some time, and many of us worked while we were younger than we would have liked \u2014 but now that we are independent and keeping our incomes, we focus on protecting those around us. We are passionate about protecting our community.\n\nWhen I was just starting my career, it was other sex workers on Tumblr (who I often originally found through their adult content posts) who helped me with tips on how to avoid dangerous clients and predators, keep myself safe from STIs, and offered me self-care tips alongside basic business advice. Under Tumblr\u2019s new guidelines, those protective communities will disappear.\n\nTumblr is following in the footsteps of other sites (like Patreon) that have begun banning porn outright, stating that other there are other places people can find adult content. However, these options are becoming increasingly limited and trending towards sites operated by massive corporations like MindGeek, a media conglomerate that essentially holds the monopoly on internet pornography.\n\nWhen our content is in the hands of massive pornography corporations, it takes control away from independent creators and communities. That means less content geared toward sexual interests that are considered niche \u2014 often queer porn or porn that isn\u2019t centered on thin, cis bodies.\n\nSure, the technology is out there to allow users to continue browsing a variety of porn from independent producers, but it will require a real effort on the part of content producers and platform creators to regain the same freedoms of the early internet. With Tumblr becoming the latest in a long line of casualties (we\u2019ve tracked over 150), it should be blatantly obvious that we can\u2019t leave the future of online communication to a handful of massive corporations.\n\nAccess to online opportunities have been an essential part of the safety sex workers have gained in this industry. Every platform we lose means some of that hard-earned safety is lost.\n\nBy pushing us off of its site, Tumblr is forcing sex workers further into the margins of society. Tumblr is communicating that any and all pornography is not art, but dirty and wrong, and that sex workers should be hidden from sight and ghettoized. Phrasing this as an attempt to make the site \u201cmore positive\u201d (while hate speech on the site continues to be public) rubs salt into the wound.\n\nThe world of internet pornography is more than just a place for adult sexual content, it\u2019s also a community of like-minded people. Porn is often how people are introduced to and able to understand their queer sexualities and identities. Pornography is a space that allows LGBTQ people to finally see themselves and their sex lives written, drawn or filmed and not treated like it\u2019s something bad or abnormal.\n\nIf consensual sexual content is censored, limited views on queer sexuality may follow. Queer communities have been able to make great strides in recent years in part because of the humanizing force of social media; it would be painful to have that stigma rear up once more.\n\nIf the trend of silencing sex workers continues, the results will be devastating. Access to the same platforms and online opportunities as everyone else have been an essential part of the safety we have gained in this industry \u2014 female homicide rates dropped overall in this country after Craigslist launched its erotic services sections \u2014 and every platform we lose means some of that hard-earned safety is lost.\n\nTumblr\u2019s decision to ban adult content will hurt more than it will help. If the platform really wants to create a \u201cbetter, more positive Tumblr,\u201d it should embrace and protect the marginalized communities on its site \u2014 something they should be proud of \u2014 and take more effective steps to engage in a community solidly dedicated to ending sexual exploitation and creating a better, more positive world for human sexuality.\n\nDisclosure: Tumblr and HuffPost share a parent company, Oath."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The Real Reason Why American Lives Are Getting Shorter", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-life-expectancy-americans_us_5c0982b0e4b0b6cdaf5d37c8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "A Spanish flu pandemic infected approximately one-third of the global population in 1918. In the United States alone, about 675,000 people died, enough to contribute to a decline in the country\u2019s life expectancy. For a century, this decline remained singular in the annals of American health \u2015 until last month, when the National Center for Health Statistics reported that, between 2016 and 2017, U.S. life expectancy dropped from 78.7 to 78.6 years.\n\nThis marks the third consecutive year that life expectancy in the U.S. has decreased, a multiyear drop not seen since that 1918 flu pandemic. And it reflects a longer-term trend in which U.S. life expectancy has lagged relative to other economically comparable countries. Overall, our lives have gotten longer, but at a slower rate than our peers.\n\nWhy has U.S. life expectancy slowed to its present reversal? The reasons cited by the National Center for Health Statistics are largely twofold: suicide and opioid deaths. But the real explanation as to why those issues continue to worsen is because America has failed to invest in our nation\u2019s health.\n\nLast year, the number of suicides in the U.S. was the highest it has been in decades: A total of 47,000 suicides occurred that year, up from 45,000 the year before. Suicide is a complex phenomenon; our understanding of its causes is incomplete and continues to evolve. However, we do know that guns are a key driver of suicide deaths. Firearm suicide is responsible for approximately 22,000 deaths each year in the U.S., including the deaths of upward of 950 children and teenagers.\n\nOpioids are an equally urgent threat. The U.S. saw 70,237 drug overdose deaths in 2017, 47,600 of which involved an opioid. These deaths have been driven by the emergence of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine \u2014 just a few milligrams can be deadly.\n\nThis marks the third consecutive year that life expectancy in the U.S. has decreased, a multiyear drop not seen since that 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nBoth fentanyl and guns have become ubiquitous in the U.S., which has amplified their threat to our health. Fentanyl use, for example, has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2016, synthetic opioids were linked to almost 50 percent of total opioid-related deaths, a significant increase from 2010, when they were linked with just 14 percent of opioid-related deaths. This is due largely to a thriving black market in which the drug is manufactured overseas and shipped into the country. Guns are in ample supply too, due to our uniquely permissive gun laws, and the actions of politicians and special interests who have worked to keep this status quo in place. Their efforts have been so successful that there are now more guns than people in America.\n\nThese causes are important. There is a temptation to think gun suicides and opioid deaths just \u201chappen,\u201d that they are a collection of isolated tragedies brought on by fate or poor decisions. We often see this thinking in the wake of gun violence, when politicians say that nothing can prevent such tragedies, that they are an unavoidable consequence of living in a dangerous world, and that \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people do.\u201d Many factors play a role in causing gun violence, but at the heart of this epidemic is easy access to guns. Our research team, for example, looked at gun laws in 10 countries and found a link between laws restricting gun availability and a decrease in gun deaths. If guns\u2019 ubiquity drives gun violence, politics \u2014 and the currents of power and culture that inform it \u2014 lies at the heart of why our country is home to so many guns, and so much violence.\n\nA similar range of factors accounts for the proliferation of opioids. In addition to the spread of fentanyl, the opioid epidemic is a product of the overprescribing of opioids, and the widespread availability of cheap heroin. Taken together, these causes speak to a core truth about the contemporary epidemics of gun suicides and opioid deaths: They do not just \u201chappen.\u201d Rather, they emerge from the social, economic, and political context of contemporary American life. Unless we address this context, we cannot hope to solve these problems.\n\nBut have we not already addressed these challenges by investing in health? After all, the U.S. spends more on health than any other country in the world. Why, then, do we have a life expectancy that suggests a society convulsed by plague?\n\nThe reason is that we do not actually invest in health. We invest in health care. The vast majority of our health spending goes to doctors, medicines and cutting-edge treatments that help us when we are sick. Far less goes to the social, economic and environmental factors that determine whether or not we get sick in the first place. These factors are shaped by a network of policies and institutions that promote health by providing basic public goods. These goods include clean air and water, safe neighborhoods, high-quality public education, and a fair economy. Without these goods, we cannot be healthy.\n\nThere is a temptation to think gun suicides and opioid deaths just 'happen,' that they are a collection of isolated tragedies brought on by fate or poor decisions.\n\nIf someone grows up in an economically depressed area, without access to a good education, a stable job or quality health care, if she sustains a work injury and is overprescribed opioids and develops an addiction she cannot afford to sustain, and so finds herself buying the cheapest heroin she can find, and fatally overdoses after consuming a batch laced with fentanyl, is it any surprise, in this context, that she came to such an end? Yet in our society, we are much more likely to ascribe her death to her own poor judgement than we are to consider the many external factors that put her in such a desperate position. We are much more likely to think \u201cPeople with addiction should behave better\u201d than we are to think \u201cHow can we create a society where addiction and despair is not the default way of life for so many people?\u201d\n\nIt is not easy to embrace the latter perspective. We like to find simple causes for the effects we see. It is easier to think people shoot themselves simply because they are sad, that they overdose because they too greedily pursue the pleasure drugs can bring. But this does not reflect reality. Our modern epidemics are actually the products of immense complexity. Believing otherwise has led to decades of disinvestment in the public goods that create health.\n\nWe have embraced the idea that simply maximizing individual freedom at all costs is the key to a better life, and that sickness is just a failure of people to take responsibility for themselves. We have run this experiment while many of our peer countries have indeed invested in health. That our life expectancy now lags behind theirs reflects the dead end our path has led us to. If we do not start investing in health, and the conditions that allow it to flourish, we will not be able to stop current epidemics, or prevent the rise of new ones.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the lethal dose of fentanyl as a few grams; in fact, a few milligrams can be deadly."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Chinese Fighters Combining Kung Fu With Bullfighting", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/update-1-enter-the-bull-fighters-mix-kung-fu-and-bullfighting-in-china_us_5c09b84be4b04046345a88fa", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "By Xihao Jiang and Martin Quin Pollard\n\nBEIJING/JIAXING, China, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Several times a week, kung fu teacher Ren Ruzhi enters a ring to spar with a bovine opponent around five times his weight and capable of killing him.\n\nRen\u2019s mixing of martial arts and bullfighting worries his\n\nmother, but the 24-year-old has never been hurt. Besides, he says, grappling with a snorting bull is exciting.\n\n\u201cIt symbolizes the bravery of a man,\u201d Ren told Reuters in\n\nJiaxing in China\u2019s eastern province of Zhejiang.\n\nUnlike Spain\u2019s more famous sport, the Chinese variant of\n\nbullfighting involves no swords or gore but instead fuses the moves of wrestling with the skill and speed of kung fu to bring down beasts weighing up to 400 kg (882 lb).\n\n\u201cSpanish bullfighting is more like a performance or a show,\u201d said Hua Yang, a 41-year-old enthusiast who watched a bullfight during a visit to Spain.\n\n\u201cThis (the Chinese variety) is truly a contest pitting a\n\nhuman\u2019s strength against a bull. There are a lot of skills\n\ninvolved and it can be dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe physically demanding sport requires fighters to train\n\nintensively and they typically have short careers, said Han\n\nHaihua, a former pro wrestler who coaches bullfighters at his Haihua Kung fu School in Jiaxing.\n\nHan calls the bullfighting style he teaches \u201cthe explosive\n\npower of hard \u2018qigong\u2019,\u201d saying it combines the skill and speed of martial arts with traditional wrestling techniques.\n\nTypically, a fighter approaches the bull head on, grabs its\n\nhorns and twists, turning its head until the bull topples over.\n\n\u201cWhat do I mean by explosive power?\u201d Han asked. \u201cIn a flash! Pow! Concentrate all your power on one point. All of a sudden, in a flash, wrestle it to the ground.\u201d\n\nIf the first fighter gets tired, another one can step into\n\nthe ring, but they have just three minutes in which to wrestle the bull to the ground or lose the bout.\n\nThe bulls, too, are trained before entering the ring, Han\n\nsaid, and learn themselves how to spread their legs or find a corner to brace against being taken down.\n\n\u201cA bull can also think like a human, they are smart,\u201d Han\n\nadded.\n\nAlthough he says his bulls get better treatment than the\n\nanimals involved in the Spanish sport, animal rights activists believe Chinese bullfighting is still painful for the animals and cruel as a form of entertainment.\n\n\u201cIn Chinese bullfighting, we cannot deny the bulls experience pain,\u201d said Layli Li, a spokeswoman for animal welfare group PETA. \u201cAs long as it exists, that means there is suffering.\u201d\n\n($1=6.9153 Chinese yuan renminbi)"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Lena Dunham Cannot Speak For All Women With Chronic Illness", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-lena-dunham-chronic-illness_us_5c0967cae4b04046345a20d8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "In Allison P. Davis\u2019 recent Lena Dunham profile in The Cut, which focused heavily on the \u201cGirls\u201d creator\u2019s chronic health issues, Dunham told the writer at one point that she\u2019d \u201clike to be the face of\u201d the fibromyalgia drug Lyrica. This comment, among others, left me wondering: Is Dunham capable of being part of a collective movement without trying to be its face?\n\nI don\u2019t think she can. And the fact that she\u2019s trying to be is a problem.\n\nDespite multiple public mishaps over the past several years caused by her own lack of awareness, Dunham continues to demand center stage \u2015 in her own work, in her mother\u2019s photography series on gender, in the #TimesUp movement, and now among the disabled and chronically ill. It\u2019s because of Dunham\u2019s privilege that she\u2019s able to do this. Privilege of any kind (racial, economic, gender) is not inherently bad, but it comes with the responsibility to amplify the voices of marginalized folks.\n\nLena Dunham, in her refusal to do this and instead be the voice herself, is hurting the very causes she claims to support. When she accused Aurora Perrineau, a Black biracial woman, of fabricating a rape allegation against one of Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d colleagues in 2017, she made it clear she doesn\u2019t understand both the weight of her voice and the very movement she claims to ardently support. The same can be said for her eagerness to write the script for a film about Syrian refugee Doaa Al-Zamel rather than insisting the team hire a Syrian writer.\n\nThese are just two items on Davis\u2019 \u201clist of things Dunham has been asked to apologize for\u201d but has ultimately failed to learn from. Her recent guest editor\u2019s letter in The Hollywood Reporter is another example of the media\u2019s willingness to allow Dunham to fail up, giving her a platform to excuse her dismissal of Perrineau as a learning experience. I\u2019m hesitant to believe that her time silent on the issue was spent in introspection; if it had been, she may have had the foresight to realize the \u201cWomen in Entertainment\u201d issue of The Hollywood Reporter was not supposed to be a public forum for her own redemption. These actions and subsequent hollow apologies prove Dunham can\u2019t be the one to represent the chronically ill and/or disabled \u2015 especially the most marginalized of us, a group she repeatedly fails to uplift.\n\nRather than center Dunham\u2019s narrow experience battling chronic illness as a wealthy white woman, we should pass the mic to people with diverse experiences.\n\nI\u2019m a Lebanese-American Muslim woman with endometriosis and mental illnesses. I haven\u2019t experienced poverty, but my family has always struggled financially and continues to do so now. I understand the frustration and difficulties that come with finding good care as a woman of color with illnesses often considered \u201cinvisible\u201d or even fake.\n\nThe intersections of poverty, race, class and gender with illness and disability are complex. To properly navigate these issues, it\u2019s crucial we seek out those who have lived in their crossroads. Rather than center Dunham\u2019s narrow experience battling chronic illness as a wealthy white woman, we should pass the mic to people with diverse experiences. And though our Twitter feeds should hardly be where our engagement ends, it\u2019s a good place to become familiar with intersectional issues in the disability and chronic illness communities.\n\nDisabled Black women like Vilissa Thompson, Keah Brown and Imani Barbarin highlight the scarcity of disabled people of color in the media, the lack of diverse voices within the disability community, and the particular challenges Black disabled women face. (Check out #DisabilityTooWhite, #DisabledAndCute and #HealthcareWhileColored to see their influence in action.) And research substantiates these women\u2019s experiences. Black people, and particularly Black women, are not receiving equal health care to their white counterparts. By and large, doctors ignore Black women\u2019s pain and spend less time with Black patients, both of which can cause medical trauma and frustration when seeking help for chronic illnesses or disabilities. Through Thompson, Brown and Barbarin, we learn about the experiences unique to Black disabled women. Amplifying their voices encourages more diverse, inclusive and representative discourse from which everyone benefits.\n\nThe health care battle in the U.S. may seem like just another policy debate to Lena Dunham and other wealthy Americans, but its implications are outrageously costly for middle class and poor chronically ill people. Azmia Magane and Porochista Khakpour both write about living with chronic illnesses and how being sick is far from cheap \u2015 it\u2019s actually criminally, immorally expensive. The road to diagnosis for so-called \u201cinvisible\u201d illnesses like lupus, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, endometriosis and others is a painstakingly difficult and long process, and running multiple tests and visiting several specialists takes an economic and emotional toll. I\u2019ll let you guess how many doctors told me that my excruciating cramps were just \u201cpart of being a woman\u201d before I was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis.\n\nIs Dunham capable of being part of a collective movement without trying to be its face?\n\nIn sharing their experiences, Magane and Khakpour also highlight an issue that an overwhelming number of Americans face: Around 79 million of us struggle to pay our medical bills and have accumulated medical debt. A diagnosis can bring relief and validation, but it also brings a slew of medical bills to fund treatments, trips, hospital stays and prescriptions. I\u2019ve personally had to pick and choose which doctor I can afford to see in a given month. Money shouldn\u2019t be a barrier in accessing quality health care \u2015 and for Lena Dunham, it isn\u2019t. Patients like Dunham, who can afford health care and have adequate insurance, should be using their privilege to advocate for universal health care and increase visibility of medical debt and its effects.\n\nEven activism itself is often inaccessible for many who wish to advocate for themselves. To combat this, Aditi Juneja, a lawyer and writer, used her experience as a woman with a disability to create the Resistance Manual, an intersectional and accessible tool that aims to help English speakers educate themselves on American policy issues, organize around them and take action. But most Americans who regularly protest the Trump administration\u2019s injustices don\u2019t consider the lack of accessibility in activist spaces \u2015 including public marches. Mia Ives-Rublee is a disabled woman of color and the founder and coordinator for the Women\u2019s March on Washington Disability Caucus. In the early days of the Women\u2019s March, the movement centered around white women, and even when women of color took the helm, disability rights were absent from its platform. Ives-Rublee worked with the march\u2019s co-chairs to ensure the movement included these rights.\n\nSocial justice movements, if they wish to be accessible to all, should include and engage with disabled people from the point of inception. Disability can intersect with any and all identities, and disability rights should be considered integral in any activist space. If she truly wanted to be an advocate, Lena Dunham could use her fame and access to request meetings with leaders of these types of events and demand accessibility for the movement\u2019s chronically ill and disabled members.\n\nI am not among the most marginalized, nor can I possibly include every person\u2019s unique experience. I am non-disabled, cisgender, have good insurance (with high co-pays), somewhere to live, food to eat and a great support system. My experiences are considered standard in a system not created to serve everyone. Trans and non-binary people, undocumented folks and indigenous people all have unique and important experiences with chronic illness and disability that also need amplification. What I and many others ask of Lena Dunham is simple: Own your privilege and use it to amplify those whose voices are so often pushed out into the margins, where this system wants them to stay."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported.

Facebook later expanded its relationship to include promoting negative coverage of Google and Apple, whom Facebook views as rivals.\n\nSchrage accepted blame for not properly managing Facebook\u2019s relationship with Definers, explaining that as its work with the PR firm expanded, the relationship was \u201cless centrally managed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d Schrage wrote, noting that he approved the decision to hire Definers \u201cand similar firms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nBut Schrage also partly blamed company culture.\n\n\u201cOur culture has long been to move fast and take risks.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Tracleer, which is prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, sells in pharmacies for an average cash price of about $14,500 for 60 tablets, according to the website GoodRx.\n\nCaroline Pavis, a spokeswoman for Actelion, said in a statement that the company was committed to complying with the law. It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence \u2014 they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.\n\nBut federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies\u2019 treatments for the pulmonary condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Why Are Scientists So Upset About the First Crispr Babies?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/health/crispr-gene-editing-embryos.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "Instead, Dr. He went ahead and disabled a perfectly normal gene, CCR\u2085. While people who are born with both copies of CCR\u2085 disabled are resistant to H.I.V., they are more susceptible to West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis. And there are simpler and safer ways to prevent H.I.V. infection.\n\nMore worrying, Crispr often inadvertently alters genes other than the one being targeted, and there are also circumstances, called mosaicism, where some cells contain the edited gene and others do not. Dr. He claimed in a video that Crispr did not affect other genes in the twins and that the babies were \u201cborn normally and healthy,\u201d but there is no way to know if that is true.\n\nIn fact, some of the data Dr. He presented at a conference in Hong Kong, after he announced the birth of the twins, is concerning, several scientists said. For one thing, it indicates that he was able to disable both copies of the CCR\u2085 gene in only one of the twins, whom Dr. He identified as \u201cNana.\u201d In the other twin, \u201cLulu,\u201d only one copy of CCR\u2085 was disabled, providing limited, if any, protection against H.I.V., but Dr. He implanted the embryo anyway. He said he informed the parents and they wanted both embryos implanted.\n\nSome scientists said the data Dr. He presented also suggested several potential issues resulting from the editing process.\n\nMost importantly, said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania who reviewed the data, \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence of mosaicism\u201d in the edited embryos of both twins. \u201cI was so furious,\u201d Dr. Musunuru said. \u201cThis would have been disturbing anyway \u2014 gene-edited babies.
