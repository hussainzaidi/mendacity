William McRaven, former head of Special Operations Command, and attacked the military for not having killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before 2011.\n\nHe also dismissed a Washington Post report that the CIA believes that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of the paper's journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a possible fresh example of the President ignoring his intelligence agencies when it conflicts with his political goals.\n\nAnd Trump revived alarmist talk over a caravan of asylum seekers marching across Mexico toward the southern border, on which he anchored a midterm campaign that was laced with falsehoods and racism.\n\n\"The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that 'the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months'\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nThe Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that \"the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.\" Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nAnd days after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders reacted to a court ordering the return of the confiscated credential of CNN's Jim Acosta by demanding \"decorum,\" Trump blasted a vulgar tweet at a longtime foe.\n\n\"So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\" Trump wrote, referring to Adam Schiff, who will run the House Intelligence Committee next year.\n\nSo funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2018\n\nFor any other president, these attacks and comments would represent an extraordinary breach of White House norms.\n\nFor Trump, they reflect his own combative temperament and willingness to flout conventions and political correctness that he clearly believes are key to his strong bond with his most loyal supporters.\n\nHis jab at Schiff was also a reminder of how the Russia investigation, now thought to be in a critical stage, hovers over everything else that happens in Trump's presidency.\n\nTrump said he will submit written answers to questions posed by Mueller about alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia this week.\n\nNo changing course\n\nThe President's determination to follow his instincts and reluctance to moderate his confrontational approach suggests that there has been little self reflection about the Democratic capture of the House that was fueled on a rejection of Trump by suburban voters.\n\nIt may also indicate that the President will win or lose in his re-election race in 2020 by betting on his strategy of mobilizing an angry political base to win the electoral college, as he did in 2016. Such an approach helped him win Senate seats -- albeit on a favorable electoral map for the GOP -- this year.\n\nBut exit polls showed that 38% of people who cast a vote in House races did so to oppose Trump, compared to 26% who did so to support him.\n\nOne possible remedy would be for Trump to moderate the polarizing behavior that damaged him with women voters and independents in urban areas, to try to win them back to the fold in 2020.\n\nThere have been rare moments of bipartisanship from Trump in recent days. Democrats and Republicans gathered at the White House to celebrate a bill that represents a small step towards criminal justice reform.\n\nTrump tweeted tributes to two foes he had furiously criticized during the midterms -- Democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Andrew Gillum of Florida after they formally conceded defeat.\n\nCongratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future! Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2018\n\nCongratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 17, 2018\n\nBut there are firmer signs that Trump is planning to become even less constrained by norms, as evident in his talk of changing his Cabinet.\n\nBy appointing Whitaker, a Mueller critic, in place of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the President has already removed an impediment to his desire to control the Justice Department.\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday\" he said he wants more aggressive enforcement of his hardline immigration policies.\n\nReferring to reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on the way out, Trump said: \"I want her to get much tougher, and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\"\n\nOne senior administration official characterized the President's goals in reshaping his team for CNN's Jake Tapper last week.\n\n\"In this administration, there are arsonists and there are firefighters. The President is looking to get rid of the firefighters. The more he does, the faster his administration is going to burn down,\" the official said.\n\nRetrenchment still\n\nThe weekend's developments with McRaven and in the Khashoggi case were revealing of the President's approach.\n\nMcRaven was prominent during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and so he was a characteristic target for the President.\n\n\"OK, he's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama-backer, and frankly ... wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?\" Trump told Chris Wallace of Fox News.\n\nMcRaven responded by telling CNN that he did not \"back Hillary Clinton or anyone else\" and said he admired Obama and Bush for leadership in challenging times.\n\n\"I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime,\" McRaven said.\n\nThe Washington Post report about the CIA's conclusions on Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul complicated Trump's efforts to safeguard his close relationship with the Saudi crown prince and will fuel a building confrontation with those in Congress who want serious action against Riyadh.\n\nThe President and the State Department said that no final determination has been made about who ordered Khashoggi's death."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump bashes architect of bin Laden raid", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/3igswKzk_aY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Retired Adm.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) You could write an encyclopedia about the ways in which Barack Obama is different from his successor, Donald Trump. On Saturday, Michelle Obama provided a more concise explanation for what distinguishes the two presidents from one another: Obama put country first; Trump puts himself first.\n\nThe former First Lady, while speaking at an event to promote her new book, \"Becoming,\" explained the genesis behind the line she famously delivered at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: \"When they go low, we go high.\"\n\nAs Mrs. Obama explained, \"That motto is his motto,\" referring to her husband. She continued, \"I say that because that's how Barack operates,\" adding, \"I mean there's so many times when I just want him -- like I know all of you -- to just curse them out .\"\n\nSo why didn't her husband go full Trump as president and personally demean and ridicule his opponents on social media and at rallies? As Mrs. Obama explained, the reason why a person would go \"low\" is simple: \"Oftentimes, going low means you're acting from a place of ego. You're really just satisfying your immediate need to lash out.\"\n\nThen she shared two key lines that summed up her husband's guiding philosophy on why he avoided going \"low\" in response to his critics: \"The president isn't the president for his own ego. The president is the president for the entire country.\"\n\nThat, my friends, crystalizes one of the primary differences between the 44th and 45th Presidents in a simple yet effective way. While Obama strived to put his ego second and be the president for all Americans first, Trump is the opposite. Trump is all about Trump . He's the king of personal victimhood and lashes out whenever his ego demands, be it attacking the media as \"fake news\" or going after late-night comedians for being \"unfair\" to him.\n\nRecently we saw Trump battle several reporters at a press conference for asking questions he didn't appreciate -- including CNN's Jim Acosta, who pressed Trump on the migrant caravan. Trump angrily responded to Acosta's questions , \"That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough,\" telling the reporter to, \"put down the mic.\" Trump later lashed again at Acosta, saying, \"You are a rude, terrible person.\"\n\nTrump even had Acosta's press credentials taken away later that day. Thankfully a (Trump-appointed) federal judge on Friday granted a temporary injunction to reinstate Acosta's press access\n\nIn contrast, look what happened in 2012 when a reporter for the right-wing Daily Caller heckled President Obama during a speech in the White House's Rose Garden by yelling out, \"Why'd you favor foreigners over Americans?\"\n\nDid Obama angrily berate the reporter or revoke his press credentials? No, instead Obama responded calmly, \"Excuse me, sir, but it's not time for questions.\" And then when the President concluded his remarks, he politely responded to the reporter, \"In answer to your question, sir -- and the next time I'd prefer you'd let me finish my statement before you ask that question -- is this is the right thing to do for the American people.\"\n\nBut if you pay attention to Mrs. Obama's words, the contrasting responses make sense. Trump has never tried to be anything more than the president of his base. And he seems happy to be just that. He knows his base loves the way he lashes out at the media, Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) and anyone who dares to not give him the tribute he believes he's entitled. It's the same reason Trump continually serves his base the same red meat he served on the campaign trail from wanting to build a wall to ginning up fears of brown immigrants.\n\nTrump, as president, never pivoted to the center to reach out to more Americans -- because it's never been about reaching all Americans. It's always been about maintaining his grip on power and surrounding himself with people who praise him accordingly.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

And at a time like this, you don't take down a government. You don't go to elections. It's irresponsible,\" Netanyahu said on Sunday in a television address.\n\nThe resignation of Liberman, the hardline leader of the rightwing Yisrael Beiteinu party, left the government with 61 seats -- a majority of only one seat -- in the 120-seat Knesset.\n\nNaftali Bennett, the right-wing education minister, then demanded the post of defense minister or threatened to quit the coalition, which would topple Netanyahu's government and force early elections.\n\nTalks between Bennett and Netanyahu broke down on Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also called for early elections.\n\nNetanyahu, who assumed the defense ministry himself, held talks with Kahlon on Sunday as he attempted to hold the coalition together.\n\nA general view of the Israeli city of Ashkelon, as an Iron Dome anti-missile fires near the Israeli side of the Israel-Gaza border, November 12, 2018.\n\nControversial ceasefire struck\n\nThe crisis began after a barrage of some 400 rockets was launched from Gaza toward Israel on November 12, hours after a botched Israeli operation in Gaza left a Hamas commander and an Israeli soldier dead. The Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza.\n\nA renewed ceasefire was brokered by the Egyptians and the United Nations to end the hostilities. Liberman denounced the ceasefire as a \"capitulation to terror.\"\n\nHowever, Netanyahu once again defended the ceasefire on Sunday, saying it was done in consultation with Israel's security establishment, suggesting there might be future military action.\n\n\"I know what to do, when to do it, and we will do it,\" said Netanyahu.\n\n\"I hope that all of the partners will show responsibility and will not topple the government,\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu has faced coalition crises in the past but none as serious as the one currently unfolding. He has repeatedly promised to see out the government's term to November 2019, but that pledge seems increasingly in doubt.\n\nIf the coalition parties agree by the end of the month to call early elections, they are required by law to hold the vote within three to five months, putting the earliest possible election window in late February or early March.\n\nThe political turbulence comes as Netanyahu faces criminal investigations that have hit him and his inner circle. Israeli police say they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in two separate investigations.\n\nHe was questioned as a suspect in a third investigation. Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, often employing the phrase \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\"\n\nThe criminal investigations have barely damaged the Prime Minister's standing in the polls or his popularity. Polls have repeatedly projected that Netanyahu's Likud party would hold onto or increase its number of seats if early elections are held."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Lion Air crash: Freak accident or lack of training?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/p4OQvs0iHiI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The passengers on the Lion Air 610 flight were on board one of Boeing's newest, most advanced planes.\n\nThe pilot and co-pilot of the 737 MAX 8 were more than experienced, with around 11,000 flying hours between them.\n\nThe weather conditions were not an issue and the flight was routine.\n\nSo what caused that plane to crash into the Java Sea just 13 minutes after takeoff?\n\nMore than two weeks after the catastrophe, investigators are still piecing together the clues.\n\nAs they do, the focus has turned to Boeing, which allegedly failed to tell pilots about a new system feature implicated in the crash -- information that aviation analysts say could have possibly saved the lives of all 189 people on board.\n\nA lawsuit against Boeing related to the crash was filed Thursday.

Hide Caption 27 of 27\n\nA facelift\n\nIn recent years, Lion Air, the popular Indonesian budget carrier, had given itself a makeover.\n\nThe privately owned carrier was the first airline to put Boeing's 737 MAX 8 -- a more efficient and environmentally friendly upgrade of a jet introduced in 1967 -- into service. According to Boeing, the Max jets are said to be 10% to 12% more efficient than their predecessors.\n\nIn 2011, Lion Air announced a $21.7 billion order for 230 of the single-aisle, twin-engine jets -- the largest single order for commercial jets in its history at the time, according to Boeing.\n\nLion Air became the first airline to put the 737 MAX 8 into service, and later started buying more versions -- the 9 and larger 10 in a $6.24 billion deal this year.\n\nThose upgrades may have signaled a bid by Lion Air to rectify its spotty safety record over the last decade, including a 2013 non-fatal crash and a ban from European and US airspace between 2007 and 2016.\n\nThe European and US bans have since been lifted, with the international civil aviation organization giving the airline its top rating in terms of safety this year. The MAX 8s have been a visible part of that boost.\n\nBut with any new fleet, pilots must undergo additional training.\n\n\"Generally speaking, when there is a new delivery of aircraft -- even though they are the same family -- airline operators are required to send their pilots for training,\" Bijan Vasigh, professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told CNN.\n\nThose training sessions generally take only a few days, but they give the pilots time to familiarize themselves with any new features or changes to the system, Vasigh said.\n\nOne of the MAX 8's new features is an anti-stalling device, the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS). If the MCAS detects that the plane is flying too slowly or steeply, and at risk of stalling, it can automatically lower the airplane's nose.\n\nIt's meant to be a safety mechanism. But the problem, according to Lion Air and a growing chorus of international pilots, was that no one knew about that system.\n\nZwingli Silalahi, Lion Air's operational director, said that Boeing did not suggest additional training for pilots operating the 737 MAX 8. \"We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots,\" Zwingli told CNN Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether an angle of attack (AOA) sensor on the outside of the Lion Air plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the MCAS to force the plane's nose down.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nInvestigators said that the day before the crash, the jet experienced problems with its AOA sensor, which was replaced. The last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), also had problems.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Southwest Airlines, a US carrier that also has a fleet of MAX 8 planes, replaced two malfunctioning AOA sensors, during the three weeks before the Lion Air crash.\n\nLion Air was was the first airline to put Boeing's 737 Max 8 into service.\n\nCNN has asked Boeing for a copy of the original manuals issued to carriers who bought the Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing has not provided those operation manuals to CNN. Representatives from American, United and Southwest airlines have all told CNN that Boeing did not include information in its Flight Crew Operations Manual that explained the functions of the new feature.\n\nLion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new system, according to Reuters , which has seen the manual.\n\nCNN has reviewed updated guidance issued by Boeing on November 6, and a subsequent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) emergency directive that reinforced Boeing's update on November 7.\n\n'Doomed'\n\nMary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and the former inspector general of the United States Department of Transportation, said that one of the selling points of the Boeing 737 fleet is that pilots can move from one plane to another easily if they are already trained on one of the jets.\n\nThe fact that Boeing could have failed to include the proper guidance on the new manual could have been an oversight, she said. She also said that updating a manual can be a long process for manufacturers and airlines.\n\nIt's possible that Boeing could have downplayed the changes to the system as a selling point, according to Schiavo, who added that she hoped the error was an \"innocent\" one.\n\nBoeing likely \"assumed it would save the plane when it looks like it might have doomed the plane,\" she added.\n\nA Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) emergency directive sent to all MAX 8 operators on November 7 explained that pilots can stop a malfunctioning automated system on those planes by pressing two buttons.\n\nThe FAA bulletin said that all carriers were to revise their manuals within three days. \"This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain,\" it said.\n\nAutomated systems are known to occasionally malfunction, but trained pilots will know how to counteract those systems. Not sharing that information, Schiavo said, is another matter.\n\nIf pilots were unaware of a new feature -- or how to shut it off if it malfunctions -- they would be set up for failure, she said.\n\n\"All these improvements they (Boeing) market as more efficient and safe. To do that without the training on how to turn it off... I think that the investigators and the reports ... will find it was not an excusable mistake,\" she said, referencing another flight, the 2003 Colgan Air 9446 crash, where the aircraft also experienced a full trim nose down, and was unable to recover.\n\nThere's no way of being able to physically overcome the strength it takes to counteract a full nose stop down, she said, estimating the weight at around 800 pounds of force in the 2003 Colgan Air crash, noting that it was a much smaller regional plane where the pilots were not fighting a computer.\n\n\"I think the industry, the pilot's union -- everyone is so stunned that the plane could do this and that the pilots weren't trained to turn it off knowing it could be a fatal dive,\" Schiavo said.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the aerospace and defense consulting company, Teal Group Corporation, told CNN that he couldn't imagine that Boeing would intentionally leave out important information to pilots just to get a competitive edge over its industry rival.\n\n\"I really can't imagine that being the case, because the system doesn't really require a lot of extra training -- frankly (adding) just an extra page in the book would have sufficed. So, the idea that they did it for competitive reasons, I just don't get that,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nInstead, he believes that it's possible that it might have been an oversight or a \"technical error.\"\n\nAboulafia says that it's \"encouraging\" that pilots are voicing their concerns as their feedback helps keep the industry safe.\n\n\"If I were a consumer I would feel happy that the pilots were making their voices heard. And happy that there was cooperation between manufacturers and regulatory authorities and between the airlines and the pilots -- it's exactly that process that's made the system what it is over the past century of aviation. It's a very healthy triangle of people who communicate and you are seeing that unfold right now as we speak.\"\n\nUnaware of safety features\n\nDennis Tajer is one of those pilots who has flown the 737 MAX 8 planes. The veteran 737 captain for American Airlines, who is a spokesperson for its 15,000 member pilot union, the Allied Pilots Association (APA), told CNN the first time he learned about the MCAS safety feature was through a bulletin issued by Boeing on November 6.\n\nThe company said the bulletin was meant to reinforce procedures already in the 737 MAX flight manual. The APA rejects that claim. Tajer said Boeing broke his trust, the key component of a safety culture that he has been an active part of for over 10 years.\n\n\"When you are describing components of the aircraft that we had no idea that existed, that's what's troubling,\" Tajer said of his first read of that bulletin.\n\n\"We want to know about the new system -- and you are using the cloak of the stabilizer checklist (another related system) to describe things to which I had no knowledge existed,\" he said.\n\nTajer imagines what it might have been like for the Lion Air pilots, who he believes were also unaware of the new system and would have been struggling to understand what was going in the cockpit.\n\n\"They are human beings that are trying to process just what the heck was going on. Like a crowd of 10 people yelling at them while a nefarious and insidious system they had no idea was running on the airplane, is actually running against you.\"\n\nBut not all pilots are pointing the finger at Boeing.\n\nThis week the Seattle Times reported that the chairman of the United Airlines pilots union, which is represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), said that although the original 737 MAX 8 manual did not specify the new safety system, it did include steps on how to shut down the \"flight-control behavior it induces.\"\n\nCapt. Todd Insler, ALPA's chairman of the United branch, said that Lion Air pilots should have been aware of that procedure and that it was too soon to say anything more about the cause of the Lion Air crash.\n\n\"The story here is not why we didn't know about (the new system), it's why the pilots didn't fly the plane,\" Insler said.\n\nIn a letter sent by the ALPA President Capt. Tim Canoll to the FAA and the US National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday, the ALPA said they were \"concerned that a potential, significant aviation system safety deficiency exists\" and asked for \"immediate help and assistance in clarifying the issues with respect to the pitch control system of the aircraft.\"\n\nIt added: \"More importantly...reports indicate that information regarding the normal and non-normal operation of this system was not provided to the frontline airline employees -- the flight crews and maintenance technicians.\"\n\nAn Indonesian National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT) official examines a turbine engine from the Lion Air crash.\n\nVeteran pilot and author Patrick Smith, who does not fly 737 MAX planes, told CNN that it's too soon to determine what could have gone wrong, but that it's possible to say that an alleged system malfunction isn't entirely to blame.\n\nOn Smith's blog , \"Ask a Pilot,\" he wrote: \"Is it too big a step to say that this system, and its apparent malfunction, were entirely to blame? Is there not some basic, seat-of-the-pants airmanship skills that the pilots could have, or should have, fallen back on? If the plane was nosing over, should they not have suspected something was askew with the stabilizers or stabilizer trim, and disconnected power to those controls? Well, that's easy to ask when sitting safely in front of a keyboard, days later. The truth is, we don't know exactly what they were dealing with -- the sights, the sounds, the sensations -- in that cockpit as it was all going to hell.\"\n\nBoth Smith and Tajer believe though, that as dark and horrific as the Lion Air crash was, it has compelled the industry to face difficult questions and push for more transparency and positive learning outcomes, with passengers' safety at the helm.\n\nTajer says that now, his trust in the company is slowly rebuilding and that MAX 8 pilots aren't flying with hesitation now because they have broken through the \"sound barrier\" of information.\n\n\"We won't fly an airplane that's not safe, we've got our customers' backs.\"\n\nAboulafia agrees that there is no reason for consumers to be concerned about what could be a freak incident, adding that technological advances in the industry over the last century have demonstrated that flying is \"now the safest form of transportation ever designed in the history of mankind.\"\n\n\"We don't know the full details of this crash yet, but as for other systems have never been safer,\" Aboulafia said.\n\nSchiavo is a bit more cautious.\n\n\"I personally would avoid the 737 MAX until there is time for the pilots to be retrained,\" she said. \"I like my pilots to know how to troubleshoot in the air.\"\n\nBoeing, which made no comment on the allegations, said it was \"deeply saddened by the loss of Lion Air Flight JT 610.\"\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board.\"\n\nAutomation as collaboration\n\nThe Lion Air crash has again reignited a larger conversation about the use of automated control systems and whether cockpit procedures surrounding these systems are as safe as they should be.\n\nIt's the latest fatal crash involving an auto flight control system. Both the Air France 447 and AirAsia Flight 8501 crashes had flight-control systems and pilots working against each other with disastrous outcomes, begging the question of whether these systems help or hinder pilots.\n\nPeter Goetz, a CNN aviation analyst and former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, believes that ultimately the onus is on transparency and training, and not on automation.\n\n\"Pilots are extraordinarily skilled and if they have the right training and information they will make the right decisions, they will do the right thing. But if they don't know what's confronting them and there's been an increasing reliance on the infallibility of fly-by-wire systems, then you are faced with a real challenge. That's a broader question that's going to be looked at.\"\n\nTajer agrees. He says that technology has definitely increased the safety of our global flight systems but just like a singular dietary plan, it's not always healthy.\n\n\"Automation is an outstanding addition to the aircraft when it's in collaboration,\" Tajer said.\n\n\"But when you don't tell the human about it, it disconnects the human being from the system.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "APEC summit wraps with no joint statement amid US-China discord", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/H0XQQ-O9QGs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) For the first time in its 25-year history, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit ended Sunday with its leaders failing to agree on a formal joint statement.\n\nAll 21 APEC leaders at the annual meeting in Papua New Guinea were in agreement except China, a source within the meeting told CNN.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed late Sunday that disagreements on trade stood in the way of a final statement.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence waves after delivering his keynote speech for the CEO Summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Port Moresby on November 17, 2018.\n\n\"There are differing visions on particular elements,\" Trudeau said.\n\nChina may have been concerned about a specific line about unfair trade practices, according to a US official involved in the negotiations.

And with 993 people still unaccounted for, officials fear the death toll could keep rising.\n\nCrews are combing the remnants of houses where all evidence of life has been wiped out by flames. Many of the searchers have lost their own homes and are looking for the remains of their neighbors.\n\nWhile the search for the dead and missing continues, thousands of firefighters are trying to control the blaze. As of late Sunday, the Camp Fire had seared 150,000 acres and was 65% contained\n\n'People don't know that we're looking for them'\n\nThough the number of people missing from the Camp Fire has skyrocketed, it's hard to tell exactly how many are lost and how many may be safe elsewhere, officials said.\n\n\"That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls, emails and the 911 system,\" Honea said. \"It's not perfect data, but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection, we're trying to get some progress going.\"\n\nHundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, coroners and anthropologists are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains.\n\n\"There are a lot of people displaced, and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them,\" the sheriff said.\n\n'We're not the only family that's going through this'\n\nSadia Quint has no idea what happened to her uncle, David William Marbury, who lived in a house in the largely obliterated town of Paradise.\n\n\"We already know that his house has been burned down and his car was in his garage,\" Quint said. \"So now we're just waiting for the sheriff's department to go out there and let us know if his body's in there or not.\"\n\nHer family has provided DNA samples in case authorities find Marbury's remains.\n\n\"We're being patient just because we know we're not the only family that's going through this right now,\" Quint said. \"So everyone's kind of in it together and everyone's being really supportive.\"\n\nBut as the hours pass with no news on her uncle, Quint said she's prepared for the worst.\n\n\"He had respiratory issues and he had back problems,\" Quint said. \"It's hard to think about him not being here anymore. But as a family, we have accepted whether we get good or bad news. So we're just prepared for both.\"\n\nEscaping through ditches, front yards\n\nThe harrowing escape from fast-moving flames still haunt Dan Newman.\n\nPhotos: Wildfire evacuees take refuge in Walmart parking lot Photos: Wildfire evacuees take refuge in Walmart parking lot A wildfire evacuee sifts through a pile of clothing at a tent city in a Walmart parking lot in Chico, California, on Saturday, November 17.

Throughout the week, Stacey Abrams, his counterpart in Georgia, pushed new ads with the same demand.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams lost their respective races for governor. But their message, as the recounts and lawsuits wind down, is expected to endure and, with a Democratic House majority headed to Washington, escalate ahead of the coming presidential cycle.\n\nEmboldened by their midterm successes and enraged by the handling of elections in Florida and Georgia, Democrats are now girding for what many on the left view as an existential fight over voting rights across the country. The court decisions handed down over the past few days, as Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson fought to expand the scope of the recount and Abrams sued to bring more ballots into the mix, are likely to shape future Democratic campaigns in Republican-held states with restrictive voting laws.\n\nThe returns to date have offered the party new reason for hope -- and cause for continued concern. Faced with a rapid-fire succession of legal challenges, judges have refused to strike down or roll back laws Democrats argue were designed to disenfranchise minorities and the poor. But the courts have also been willing to offer relief to narrowly affected voter groups, like the thousands snagged by Florida's \"signature match\" law, who were allowed an extra few days to clear their ballots.\n\nLet America Vote, the nonprofit started by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, has been frustrated by the outcomes, but pleased to see the sun shining on the process.\n\n\"What this has really highlighted is that there are probably a bunch of people in Florida who have been disenfranchised in past elections and didn't even know it,\" Abe Rakov, Let America Vote's chairman, told CNN. \"But now that this election is so close, and people are making sure that every eligible vote is being counted, it's being highlighted.\"\n\nAfter withdrawing his election night concession last weekend, Gillum in Florida hammered home the message in both interviews with national liberal outlets and to supporters across the state.\n\nOn Tuesday night at St. Mark AME Church in Orlando, Gillum, whose term as Tallahassee mayor ends next week, cast the stakes of the ongoing recount efforts -- and his push to find and count every valid vote -- in imposing historical terms.\n\n\"We've got to demand a more perfect union, we have to demand a process that is more fair,\" Gillum said. \"We have to reject the belief that a signature difference is enough for somebody's entire vote to be dismissed. We've got to get rid of these arbitrary deadlines.\"\n\nThe messaging around the fight has worked.\n\nNelson's recount effort has raised $2.5 million off a string of emails from top Democratic lawmakers. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, his challenger and the leader in their tight race, brought in just $1.4 million over the same period. The spread has also confirmed for Democratic leaders that their vaunted small-dollar donor base remains fired up and ready to spend on candidates willing to fight -- even when the odds are against them.\n\nGillum refused to re-concede his race on Thursday despite the completion -- in all but one county -- of a machine recount that confirmed Republican Ron DeSantis's lead. In a statement, Gillum pointed to both failures by some counties deliver updated results and arguments made by Democrats in court as his reason for continuing on.\n\n\"Voters need to know that their decision to participate in this election, and every election, matters,\" he said. \"It is not over until every legally-cast vote is counted.\"\n\nGillum ultimately offered his concession on Saturday evening.\n\nBut Gillum's message to voters hints at sharper anxieties shared by Democrats around the country: that voters will be discouraged by the unfolding events in Florida and Georgia, and turnout numbers, up this year, will drop again. Abrams, in a fiery speech on Friday evening, first ended her campaign for governor, then announced the creation of a new voting rights PAC that in the coming days plans to launch what she described as a \"major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for the gross mismanagement of this election and to protect future elections from unconstitutional actions.\"\n\nAbrams also leveled another round of stinging accusations against her GOP rival, former Secretary of State Brian Kemp, saying that under his watch, \"democracy failed Georgia.\"\n\n\"Georgia still has a decision to make about who will we be in the next election. And the one after that. And the one after that,\" Abrams said, looking ahead that next round of races. \"So we have used this election and its aftermath to diagnose what has been broken in our process.\"\n\nDemocrats worry that anything less than a robust and well-funded fight in the aftermath of these contested 2018 elections will encourage President Donald Trump and loyal elected officials like Kemp, who over nearly a decade as Georgia's chief elections officials helped set in place the rules for a gubernatorial contest he would both run in and oversee.\n\nKemp stepped down from his position after the voting, and most of the vote-counting, was over. But on the Sunday before Election Day, his office lobbed baseless charges of voter database hacking at Georgia Democrats, while his campaign piled on -- creating a confusing swirl of accusations that, given Kemp's day job, might have appeared to carry more weight than those of typical, if outlandish, claims by a candidate.\n\nTrump is a good bet, if his first campaign was any indication, to employ similar tactics in the run-up to -- and, potentially, the aftermath of -- the 2020 election. That his conspiratorial comments about the Florida election have been so easily adopted by the previously Trump-shy Scott -- who was admonished by a federal judge for \"(toeing) the line between imprudent campaign trail rhetoric and problematic state action\" -- is viewed by voting rights advocates as a sign of things to come.\n\n\"This is President Trump laying the groundwork for 2020, to make sure his supporters will call into question the results of the election if he doesn't win,\" Rakov said. \"He's using this situation to further himself. He doesn't care about having one more senator in Washington, he just wants people to start getting the idea that election results aren't real.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, both Trump and Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of his most ardent backers on Capitol Hill, took turns trying to stoke fears over Democratic efforts in Florida.\n\nThe President sent a fundraising email with a subject line, \"NON-CITIZENS VOTING?\" and a claim below that \"Democrats are trying to overturn our Republican victories in Florida.\"\n\nGaetz, meanwhile, in an interview with Breitbart, claimed Nelson's ongoing court challenges were the precursor to a presidential heist.\n\n\"If the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and don't work, what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones aren't, then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview after Gaetz's comments began to spread, Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, pointing to new legislation being crafted by House Democrats, offered a more mundane explanation.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is create a roadmap for how to protect people's vote and their voice everywhere in this country,\" Sarbanes said. \"If we can learn something from challenging these deficiencies in our voting process (in Florida) and our voting system in this country, you're putting together a handbook not to steal elections but to have elections be an accurate reflection of the will and the voice of the people.\"\n\nSarbanes and other Democrats will introduce a host of \"democracy reforms\" to kick off the new Congress. One key piece is automatic voter registration, which would add eligible voters to the rolls unless they chose to opt out.\n\nWith Republicans adding to their majority in the Senate, the Democratic-backed measure is a near-lock to disappear once it reaches the upper chamber. Sarbanes understands the math but is hoping the optics will prompt a backlash against the Senate GOP and, eventually, the President.\n\n\"If you come with a strong, big bang declaration right out of the gate, the fact that Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate ignore it just makes the contrast even clearer,\" Sarbanes said.\n\nThe argument to voters, he added, was this: \"You gave us the gavel in the House and we showed that you that we're committed to those things. Give us the gavel in the Senate and we'll do it there. Give us a pen in the White House and we'll do it there.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Bill Nelson concedes Florida Senate race to Rick Scott", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/X7ezvhNFAKY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Democratic Sen.

Rick Scott, ending his re-election bid after the completion of a statewide recount.\n\nScott announced the concession in a statement, saying, \"I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson, who graciously conceded, and I thanked him for his years of public service.\"\n\nNelson officially announced his concession in a taped statement on Sunday.\n\n\"I was not victorious in this race, but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we fought, a public office is a public trust,\" he said.\n\nNelson added that he \"by no measure feel(s) defeated\" and reflected on his career in politics by saying he doesn't believe \"anybody could have been as blessed.\"\n\nThe concession brings to conclusion a key Senate race that continued to be fought well after Election Day.\n\nThe Senate race -- along with the governor's and state's race for agriculture commissioner -- went to a machine recount a week ago, but the recount did not do nearly enough for Nelson and further formalized Scott's more than 12,000-vote lead. The contest still fell within the .25% standard for a manual recount of overvotes and undervotes, however.\n\nNelson conceded after the noon deadline for the manual recount, when all of Florida's 67 counties were required to submit their final vote totals to the secretary of state, meaning every vote deemed admissible by county canvassing boards and the courts had been officially counted.\n\nThe results of the recount showed Scott with a vote lead of 10,033 over incumbent Nelson. Before the completion of the manual recount, Scott had a lead of 12,603 votes.\n\nNelson's concession comes a day after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum ended his campaign for governor by acknowledging that Republican Ron DeSantis had defeated him. The concession was a blow to Nelson, given the two top Democrats had figuratively stood together in calling for every legal vote cast in Florida to be counted. Gillum's bowing out was an acknowledgment that many Democrats in the state believe the fight is over.\n\nNelson acknowledged voting rights in his concession, an issue that was at the heart of both his and Gillum's messaging during the recount.\n\n\"We must end all forms of voter suppression, make it easier for Americans to vote and honor the idea that we are governed by the majority and not the minority,\" Nelson said.\n\nNelson's loss ends his nearly two-decade tenure in the Senate, where he most recently served as the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee and previously served as the chair of the Senate Aging Committee.\n\nNelson has been a fixture in Florida politics for more than four decades, serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives for six years in the 1970s before vaulting to the US House of Representatives in 1979, where he served for 12 years.\n\nNelson faced an onslaught of spending in a race that likely topped $100 million just for ads on TV, according to data from CMAG.\n\nAnd he was a top target for President Donald Trump, who considers Florida one of his home states because of Mar-a-Lago, the private club he has owned since 1985. Trump made a pair of last-minute trips to Florida to help Scott, rallying with the Republican governor and DeSantis in Fort Myers and then Pensacola during the final week of the campaign.\n\nScott, who is independently wealthy, raised an eye-popping $68 million this cycle, burying Nelson's $27 million.\n\nBut the Democratic outside money came in for Nelson after the primary, with Senate Majority PAC investing nearly $17 million, Priorities USA backing him with just over $8 million and Majority Forward spending another $5 million on Nelson's behalf.\n\nGuns and the environment took an outsized role in this race. Both Scott and Nelson pointed fingers at each other over toxic algae blooms impacting the state's waterways, hoping to woo a group of single-issue environmental voters in the state. And guns have played a large role in the state after the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, left 17 people dead.\n\nBut some of Nelson's most potent ads came in linking Scott to the President, attacks that put the governor on the defensive.\n\nOne Spanish-language ad for Nelson shows Scott shaking Trump's hand. Rick Scott and Donald Trump are \"muy buenos amigos,\" the ad says -- very good friends.\n\nThe attacks seemingly worked, because Scott had to respond by distancing himself from the President.\n\n\"When I don't agree with what President Trump does or says, I've said it,\" Scott said in an ad. \"My only commitment is with you.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Stacey Abrams calls Kemp the 'legal' governor, won't say he's legitimate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/4eaPv8YQD2k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Sunday that while her opponent, Republican Brian Kemp, was the legal victor of the state governor's race, she would not call him the legitimate winner.\n\nAbrams told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that she thought there was deliberate interference in the election, saying \"it began eight years ago with the systematic disenfranchisement of more than a million voters. It continued with the underfunding and disinvestment in polling places, in training and in the management of the county delivery of services.

The announcement followed more than a week of post-election legal maneuvering from her campaign and allies, who sought to find enough votes to reduce Kemp's lead and force a December 4 runoff.

You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.\"\n\nMom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. \"We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,\" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.\n\nThe discovery was \"distressing,\" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in \"severe stomach cramps and vomiting,\" she said. \"Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.\"\n\nGlover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was \"a gift,\" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help \"lots of other children.\"\n\nThe risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.\n\nEllis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. \"It's been a huge success,\" her mother said.\n\nThe study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.\n\nNot a cure\n\nDr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that \"it's not a cure.\"\n\n\"It does not make the allergy to go away,\" Vickery said. \"The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.\"\n\nStill, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is \"treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,\" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nTwo-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.\n\n\"These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,\" Vickery said, \"and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.\"\n\nTrying to be 'bite safe'\n\nDr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is \"the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.\"\n\n\"It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,\" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. \"It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\nThough the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. \"This is not something to try at home,\" Sicherer said.\n\nAimmune has made peanut into a \"pharmaceutical-grade\" product, he said. \"Most people think of it as medicinalized food.\" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, \"and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.\"\n\nAssuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, \"Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?\"\n\nThere are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment.\" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: \"It's peace of mind.\"\n\nEven though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. \"It's definitely better,\" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: \"You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Congo health workers face violence as Ebola virus spreads", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/CSxw58AcBxw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to rise as violence hampers health workers' efforts to battle the virus.\n\nThere are now 358 cases of Ebola and 213 deaths since the outbreak began in August, according to the nation's Ministry of Health.\n\nConflict between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas.\n\nOperations suspended\n\nOn Friday evening, an armed group tried to attack UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni in North Kivu province -- the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe attack occurred near the Ebola Response Emergency Operations Center and hotels where many Ebola health workers are staying, according to the health ministry\n\nThe peacekeepers were able to push the attackers back after several hours of clashes but all field activities were suspended in Beni Saturday due to the violence.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote.

That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Deadly multistate salmonella outbreak related to raw turkey grows", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/jPNe2HyebRs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Thanksgiving just around the corner, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain.\n\nThe samples were from a Sept. 11, 2018 production, and, according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states.

Lead officer, Chartered Trading Standards Institute\n\nWith normal economy and supplier demand, it is often the case that smaller shops, and those in more remote areas, will charge more.\n\nI always think that when you look at service station petrol prices on motorways, that is very telling, because they are normally hugely more expensive but they are open 24 hours and have higher overheads.\n\nWith smaller stores, deliveries are also harder to get to them.\n\nIt is something which has always happened and something that will always happen in future.\n\nThe law says shops must not mislead people, it is something that they must be clear about if they are advertising nationally.\n\nShops must indicate if an offer does not apply to small stores as well and sometimes you will see in small print \"not available in local stores\".\n\nThe Price Marking Order 2004 orders that the price must be clear, consumers should never have to ask the price of anything and it should be clearly available without having to ask, which supermarkets are largely very good at.\n\nImage copyright Google Maps Image caption The larger supermarkets visited were found to charge less for groceries than their convenience counterparts\n\nIn statements, the supermarkets all agreed the increase in prices was because of higher operating costs in the convenience stores.\n\nSainsbury's said that was due to the smaller shops being placed in town and city locations.\n\nWaitrose also said that higher rent and increased rates for longer opening hours were among the reasons for higher costs, but said it did offer \"promotions\" in smaller stores.\n\nTesco said it worked hard to offer customers \"great value\".\n\nMarks and Spencer said it tried to \"keep prices competitive\", but \"in line with other retailers\" prices could be higher in convenience stores.\n\nThe full investigation can be seen on BBC Inside Out West Midlands at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 19 November and for 30 days after on the BBC iPlayer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Theresa May seeks business support for Brexit plan", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46257168", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:00:40", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA\n\nTheresa May is set to renew her efforts to sell her draft Brexit withdrawal agreement -

So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

in a significant increase in CO\u2082 emissions, scientists warn.\n\nThat could mean attaining the Paris climate agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C could become harder, they say.\n\nPresent emission-cut pledges by countries are projected to increase the average global temperature rise by more than 3C by the end of the century.\n\nThat would lead to dangerous climate change impacts, experts say.\n\nThese include sea level rise, drought, wildfires, among other extreme events.\n\n\"We can't neglect the emissions from wildfires,\" says Ramon Vallejo, a scientist specialising on fire ecology with the University of Barcelona.\n\n\"Particularly now that we are seeing intense wildfires all around the world.\"\n\nEstimates and uncertainties\n\nAlthough estimates vary and still carry uncertainties, some experts say wildfires account for up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey are estimated to increase by a few percent to roughly 30% by the end of this century depending on how the climate changes.\n\n\"It is a double whammy,\" said William Lau, atmospheric scientist with Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\n\"Big forest fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is

Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun.\n\nNearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes.\n\nThe planet's mass is thought to be 3.2 times that of our own, placing it in a category of world known as a \"super-Earth\".\n\nIt orbits Barnard's star, which sits \"just\" six light-years away.\n\nThe star is an extremely faint \"red dwarf\" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.\n\nCo-author Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9 said the newly discovered world was \"possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nDr Anglada Escud\u00e9, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report says 'cut lamb and beef'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46214864", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted.\n\nHow climate change is already changing the landscape\n\nThe CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse.\n\nLoss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.\n\nProjections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.\n\n\"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "NBC Unveils On Screen Graphic Informing Audience They Are Watching Football", "article_link": "https://sports.theonion.com/nbc-unveils-on-screen-graphic-informing-audience-they-a-1830512587", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Kinja is in read-only mode.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Lashes Out at Critics of His Choice for Acting Attorney General", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4664425.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump says he would not intervene if his acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker decides to curtail a special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But some of the steps Republicans are expected to take will almost surely be challenged in court, and critics say such maneuvers undermine the political system and the will of the people, who voted for change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that smacks every Michigan voter in the face and tells them that this Republican Party doesn\u2019t care about their voice, their perspective,\u201d House Democratic Leader Sam Singh said of the strategizing to control the fate of minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.\u200b\n\n\u200bStatewide sweeps\n\nThe moves would follow midterm elections in which Democrats swept statewide offices in Michigan and Wisconsin for the first time in decades but fell short of taking over their gerrymandered legislatures. That gives Republicans a final shot to lock in new policies, with Democrats unable to undo them anytime soon.\n\nMichigan\u2019s new minimum wage and sick time laws began as ballot drives but because they were preemptively adopted by lawmakers in September rather than by voters, they can be altered with simple majority votes rather than the support of three-fourths of both chambers.\n\nOne measure would gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and increase a lower wage for tipped workers until it is in line with the minimum. The other would require that employees qualify for between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave, depending on the size of their employer.\n\nIt is unclear how the laws may be changed to appease an anxious business lobby. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce says mandatory sick time, 10 other states also require it, will place \u201csevere compliance burdens\u201d on employers, including those with paid leave policies currently in place. The group also is urging lawmakers to \u201cbe pragmatic, not extreme\u201d and revisit the wage hikes that would make Michigan\u2019s minimum the highest in the Midwest.\n\nRepublicans seem unfazed by criticism that scaling back the measures would thwart the will of voters who resoundingly elected Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to replace GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, who reached his term limit. The Michigan Senate\u2019s majority leader, Arlan Meekhof, said changes to the laws are needed to \u201ccontinue to keep our economy on track and not put a roadblock or hindrance\u201d in the way of businesses.\n\nLame-duck sessions\n\nLame-duck sessions, which are commonplace in Congress but rare among many state legislatures, are frenetic, as legislators rush to consider bills that are controversial or were put on the back burner during election season. Michigan\u2019s 2012 session, for example, produced right-to-work laws and a contentious revised emergency manager statute for cities in financial peril, despite voters having just repealed the previous law.\n\nThe lame-duck period may be especially intense this year in Michigan and Wisconsin because they are among just four states in which Republicans are losing full control the governorship and both legislative chambers. Lawmakers in the other two states, Kansas and New Hampshire, will not convene until next year.\n\nSix states with a split government now will be fully controlled by Democrats in 2019, and Alaska will be fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nOn GOP agendas\n\nWisconsin Republicans plan to consider a variety of ways to protect laws enacted by Walker. Those include limiting Evers\u2019 ability to make appointments, restricting his authority over the rule-making process and making it more difficult for him to block a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. They might also change the date of the 2020 presidential primary so that a Walker-appointed state Supreme Court justice has better odds to win election.\n\nIn North Carolina, GOP legislators may use the session for more than approving additional bipartisan Hurricane Florence relief. They are expected to implement a voter photo ID requirement passed this month by the electorate and to consider other legislation that the Democratic governor would be powerless to stop until Republicans can no longer easily override his vetoes come 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, they reduced Cooper\u2019s powers before he took office. He successfully sued over a law that diminished his role in managing elections. Other suits remain pending.\n\nMichigan\u2019s outgoing governor, Snyder, hasn\u2019t weighed in on the plan to amend the minimum wage and sick leave laws, which would require his signature, unlike when they were passed. He is trying to persuade his fellow Republicans to boost and add new fees for environmental cleanup and water infrastructure upgrades, and he wants the Legislature to help facilitate a deal to drill an oil pipeline tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac. The agreement is opposed by Whitmer and the state\u2019s Democratic Attorney General-elect, Dana Nessel.\n\nSupporters of the existing wage and sick time laws have been mobilizing to keep them intact. MI Time to Care, the campaign backing guaranteed paid time off for workers who are sick or need to stay home with an ill family member, launched ads, mailed postcards and went door to door before the election reminding people of their rights under the law that is scheduled to take effect in March.\n\nChairwoman Danielle Atkinson said the sick leave proposal would have been approved in a \u201clandslide\u201d if it had been on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly why the Legislature moved to pass it, and now they should uphold it as the promise that they made to the voters,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Gene Editing Having Impact on Farming World", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gene-editing-having-impact-on-farming-world/4663643.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Humans have been genetically modifying foods for centuries.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889.\n\nBut now, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: Some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \"the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\" which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nJon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said the vote left him \"a basket case\" and \"extremely emotional.\"\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" he said. \"That was just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\"\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the edge of Paris and collectively known as the \"heir and the spares,\" will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses decay over time.\n\nBenefits of the change\n\nThe change will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won't suddenly get kinder and kilos and grams won't change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition of the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nUnlike a physical object, the new formula for the kilo, now also known as \"the electric kilo,\" cannot pick up particles of dust, decay with time, or be dropped and damaged.\n\nIt is expected to be more accurate when measuring very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in new innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields.\n\nWith time, as the science behind the new definition becomes more accessible and affordable, it should also mean that countries won't have to send their own kilograms back to France to be checked occasionally against Le Grand K, as they have done until now, to see whether their mass was still accurate."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Somalia Struggles to Treat PTSD from War, Poverty", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-struggles-to-treat-ptsd-from-war-poverty/4661120.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Somalia's 30 years of chronic conflict have left an estimated 1 in 3 people affected by mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

(AP Photo/Marina Devo)\n\nThe discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a commemoration one year after the sub disappeared on Nov. 15, 2017.\n\nOn Thursday, on the anniversary of the disappearance, President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \u201cabsolute and non-negotiable commitment\u201d to find \u201cthe truth.\u201d\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost.

Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution. Nuon Chea was considered the main ideologist of the Khmer Rouge and the right-hand man of the group\u2019s late leader, Pol Pot, while Khieu Samphan served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nMembers of the Cham community were among the large crowd of spectators who attended Friday\u2019s session.\n\nThe court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for insuffient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead their radical policies led to what has been termed \u201cauto-genocide\u201d through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nOne of the spectators at Friday\u2019s hearing was 65-year-old Sum Rithy, who said he had been jailed for nearly two years under the Khmer Rouge, who accused him of being a spy for the CIA. His life was spared only because he was a skilled mechanic who could maintain engines and generators for his captors.\n\nRithy said three of his siblings were killed by the Khmer Rouge, also accused of being CIA spies, while his father died of starvation.\n\n\u201cToday, I am very happy that the both Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to life in prison. The verdict was fair enough for me and other Cambodian victims,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night, I could not sleep because I was afraid that Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan could die before this verdict was announced.\u201d\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van to the courthouse from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nNuon Chea, who suffers heart problems, was allowed to move from the hearing room to a separate holding room. Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same.\n\nIn addition to the two, the tribunal in 2010 convicted Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunal\u2019s accomplishments."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "British Prime Minister Hangs By A Thread As Top Leaders Quit Over Brexit Deal", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/british-prime-minister-teresa-may-ministers-quit-brexit_us_5bed9d62e4b03af89267ca22", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "The British prime minister was clinging to power by the thinnest of threads on Thursday after a wave of resignations from her Cabinet and the beginnings of a political coup to oust her as leader.\n\nTheresa May presented her draft deal for the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union on Wednesday evening in a mammoth five-hour meeting with her top ministers.

We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.\u201d\n\nBut her deal came under a sustained attack in the Commons. Only a handful of Conservative parliament members (those in May\u2019s party) spoke in favor of the agreement, which has taken 19 months of intensive negotiations to secure.\n\nLegislators in the opposing party, the Labour Party, laughed when May said her deal would allow the U.K. to leave the EU \u201cin a smooth and orderly way\u201d on March 29. But May insisted the deal was in the national interest and offered a future relationship with \u201ca breadth and depth of co-operation beyond anything the EU has agreed with any other country.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the Labour Party disagreed.\n\n\u201cTheresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her Cabinet, let alone Parliament and the people of our country,\u201d said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior team.\n\nWhat happens next depends on whether May can survive as prime minister.

Dean Heller, winning races for governor and lieutenant governor, and expanding their state legislative majorities.\n\nThe shellacking was 15 years in the making, the culmination of a long-term plan to shift a battleground into the Democratic column. Democrats elsewhere will work to replicate Nevada for years to come. Republicans were humbled.\n\n\u201cThese things can change, but right now Nevada is a blue state,\u201d said Mark Hutchison, the state\u2019s outgoing Republican lieutenant governor. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Democratic Party has done a very good job in Nevada of getting out the vote and creating an infrastructure that is formidable.\u201d\n\nThe political mastermind behind the Democrats\u2019 ascendency is 78-year-old Harry Reid, the soft-spoken former Senate majority leader who served for decades in Washington before his retirement last year. Despite being treated for pancreatic cancer, Reid has remained active in Nevada politics.\n\nReid started building the state party for the 2004 election, when Nevada was in a tug of war between its Western libertarian roots and the Democratic leanings of recent transplants. The party had no permanent staff in nonelection years; now it has double digits.\n\nSenate Republicans had sent him a warning shot that November by ousting his predecessor as Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota. That led Reid to step up efforts to protect his home flank. He helped make Nevada\u2019s caucuses one of the first-in-the-nation presidential contests and a destination for political spending by national aspirants.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter that his name wasn\u2019t on the ballot, he was all in every day,\u201d said Rebecca Lambe, a longtime Reid aide and Democratic strategist.\n\nReid used the national cash flowing in to build a strong state Democratic Party and bolster a network of pro-immigrant and environmental organizations. They worked with Las Vegas\u2019 potent unions to power a Democratic turnout machine.\n\n\u201cThis is what Democrats need to be doing everywhere. This is the long game,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist and former Reid staffer.\n\nNot everything Reid built may be easily exportable.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS FILE - In this April 3, 2018, file photo, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid speaks during a joint appearance with former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during a lecture series at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Most voters are concentrated in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. It\u2019s a state full of demographic groups that lean Democratic, with 29 percent of its population Latino and only 49 percent white.\n\nLas Vegas\u2019 economy generates lots of working-class, service jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced, making it easier for unions to organize. Most significantly, it\u2019s given birth to the Culinary Union, a 57,000-member political force representing casino workers that helps pad Democratic margins with its voter turnout programs.\n\nBut Nevada Democrats do face obstacles.\n\nThey can only win statewide if they turn out Las Vegas\u2019 transient and diverse workforce. This was one of Reid\u2019s epiphanies in 2004, Lambe said. \u201cThere was a recognition that the electorate didn\u2019t reflect the population of the state.\u201d\n\nOne solution was nonstop voter registration to keep catching new arrivals and adding them to the voter rolls. Doing that, and then turning those hard-to-reach voters out, takes money.\n\nReid is a prolific fundraiser who has been able to keep money flowing to the state. But there is a grim example for Democrats of what can happen when that spigot runs dry.\n\nIn 2014, Reid turned his attention to trying to save Democratic control of the Senate in races outside Nevada. There was no competitive race for governor or Senate to draw Nevada voters\u2019 interest. Door-knocking and voter registration in Las Vegas dwindled. Republicans swept all statewide races, even winning a congressional seat in the heart of Democratic Las Vegas that was called the \u201cCulinary District\u201d because the union had such sway there.\n\nThis year, Reid helped pick candidates and staff for important races and raised money. It\u2019s hard to quantify how the machine is funded because money flows through many different organizations. One measure is that Heller had $35 million spent against him by outside groups, as opposed to $20 million for Democratic opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Reid Machine\u2019 is synonymous with money,\u201d said Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist who advised Heller\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt totally is a resources issue. People believe the Republican Party is the party of large special interests when it is in fact the Democrat Party that had 30 outside special interest groups on the ground. Republicans did not have that.\u201d\n\nNevada Democrats worry that national donors may be overly secure that the state has gone Democratic and they may be less inclined to invest there in 2020, when there is no Senate race on the ballot.\n\n\u201cThe question is, are Democrats going to be able to raise the money when we don\u2019t have a top-of-the-ticket governor and a top-of-the-ticket Senate race,\u201d said Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Las Vegas and a former Reid staffer.\n\nReid\u2019s hand-picked successor in the Senate, former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, is supposed to take his place as chief organizer and fundraiser for the state\u2019s Democrats. Last week, she was named head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and will oversee the party\u2019s 2020 Senate races. It\u2019s a job that will connect her with many big national donors. But Cortez Masto cannot match Reid\u2019s Senate tenure and connections."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Finnish President: I Didn't Talk To Trump About Raking To Prevent Wildfires", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-camp-fire-finland-president_us_5bf1f53be4b0b84243e3608c", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "The president of Finland said Sunday that he didn\u2019t recall mentioning the use of raking to prevent wildfires during a brief interaction with President Donald Trump earlier this month, despite the U.S. leader\u2019s assertion that it spent \u201ca lot of time on raking and cleaning\u201d their forests.\n\n\u201cI mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network,\u201d Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 told his country\u2019s newspaper, the Ilta-Sanomat.

(AP) \u2014 Florida is suing the nation\u2019s two largest drugstore chains, Walgreens and CVS, alleging they added to the state and national opioid crisis by overselling painkillers and not taking precautions to stop illegal sales.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced late Friday that she has added the companies to a state-court lawsuit filed last spring against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and several opioid distributors.\n\nBondi said in a press release that CVS and Walgreens \u201cplayed a role in creating the opioid crisis.\u201d She said the companies failed to stop \u201csuspicious orders of opioids\u201d and \u201cdispensed unreasonable quantities of opioids from their pharmacies.\u201d On average, about 45 people die nationally each day because of opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A lawsuit filed by the state of Florida accuses Walgreens and CVS of fueling the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to pursue those companies that played a role in creating the opioid crisis,\u201d said Bondi, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement by President Donald Trump for recently ousted U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cThousands of Floridians have suffered as a result of the actions of the defendants.\u201d\n\nCVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis called the lawsuit \u201cwithout merit\u201d in a statement Saturday. He said the company trains its pharmacists and their assistants about their responsibilities when dispensing controlled substances and gives them tools to detect potentially illegal sales.\n\n\u201cOver the past several years, CVS has taken numerous actions to strengthen our existing safeguards to help address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic,\u201d DeAngelis said.\n\nWalgreens said Saturday it doesn\u2019t comment on pending lawsuits.\n\nRobert Alexander via Getty Images CVS and Walgreens are accused of having \u201cplayed a role in creating the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nUntil a law enforcement crackdown at the beginning of the decade, Florida was known for its so-called pain mills. Drug dealers from throughout the country would send associates to store-front clinics where unscrupulous doctors would write opioid prescriptions for bogus injuries and illnesses. At one point, 90 of the nation\u2019s top 100 opioid prescribers were Florida doctors, according to federal officials.\n\nAfter receiving the prescriptions, the phony patients would buy the pills from Florida pharmacies \u2014 state law says pharmacists must refuse to fill prescriptions they suspect are not for a valid purpose. Most of the opioids would then be taken out of state to be resold illegally at huge markups, creating a drug crisis in many communities throughout the Eastern United States.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Walgreens has dispensed billions of opioid dosages from its Florida pharmacies since 2006. The Illinois-based chain is the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chain and has more than 13,200 stores globally.\n\nThe company distributed 2.2 million opioid tablets from its store in Hudson, a Tampa-area town of 12,000, and in one unidentified town of 3,000, sold 285,000 pills in a month, the lawsuit says. In some stores, its opioid sales jumped six-fold in two years.

A fire so devastating that hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Air so polluted that people without safety masks are trapped inside. A quarantine set up by the National Guard to limit the spread of a dangerous virus.\n\nThis is not the climactic scene of an apocalyptic horror movie, set far in the future. This is California in 2018.\n\nThe flames and smoke from the Camp fire ripping through Northern California \u2015 a record-breaking catastrophe that has claimed at least 63 lives with more than 600 people still missing \u2015 is the public health crisis that climate change researchers have been warning about.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a 55-and-older community in Paradise, California, was burned to the ground.\n\nIn Butte County, where the fire has been raging for more than a week, thousands of people have been evacuated to shelters set up in churches, high schools, fairgrounds and other sites. Many have lost their homes, loved ones and neighbors. The fire has destroyed nearly 10,000 residences so far, and over 15,000 more are threatened, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).\n\nRight now, though, there\u2019s another acute issue preoccupying evacuees and shelter workers.\n\nMore than 140 Camp fire evacuees huddled in crowded shelters are showing norovirus symptoms, the Butte County Public Health Department announced Thursday. That number is likely much higher now.\n\n\u201cThe number of sick people is increasing every day,\u201d a release from the health department stated. \u201cTwenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support. Staff serving the shelters have also been sick.\u201d\n\nA visit to the East Avenue Church shelter in Chico shows just how quickly norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, is spreading in a community that has already suffered through so much unforeseen devastation.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty people were camped at the church on Friday when illness erupted in one corner of the shelter\u2019s multipurpose room. Evacuees overcome with sudden vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration were eventually protected by a barrier as volunteers rushed to treat them. They were feet away from their fellow evacuees, wearing air filtration masks and precautionary adult diapers, hoping not to add illness to the others\u2019 long lists of misfortunes. While volunteers bleached floors covered in feces and vomit, some evacuees took to the bushes outside the shelter to relieve themselves. These are the indignities of a catastrophe that no one plans for.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Avenue Church Shelter in Chico, California, where norovirus has spread and makeshift quarantine barriers have been erected.\n\nIt\u2019s not 100 percent certain that all patients are suffering from norovirus specifically, but the threat the infection poses justifies a prompt response. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are about 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly young children and the elderly, each year among those infected by it in the U.S.\n\nLater on Friday, the National Guard began setting up medical tents for Camp fire evacuees affected by norovirus in an attempt to better control its spread from shelter to shelter, all overcrowded with people made homeless by the fire and people who were already homeless but needed relief from the smoke. Some brought dogs and other pets.\n\nMeanwhile, counties more than a hundred miles from the fire are grappling with the health consequences of smoke that\u2019s settled around their homes.\n\nSince the Camp fire erupted on Nov. 8, the skies throughout the affected areas and spilling down into the San Francisco Bay Area have been brown and hazy. Visibility is poor. In San Francisco, the tops of buildings seem to disappear into the haze. Everywhere the air smells like fire.\n\nThat smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter measuring roughly 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5. These particulates are too small to be caught by our lungs\u2019 filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams, posing potential health risks to anyone breathing it but particularly to those with respiratory issues, as well as to older adults and children. Coughing, wheezing and other side effects have already affected many of those exposed to the abysmal air.\n\nThe Butte County Air Quality Management District reported \u201chazardous\u201d air quality in Paradise, where the fire started, and in nearby Chico, Oroville and Gridley. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AirNow site reported an Air Quality Index of 350 in Chico. For context, Delhi, India \u2015 one of the most notoriously polluted cities in the world \u2015 on Friday measured an AQI of about 240.\n\nEven the Bay Area, more than 165 miles from the epicenter of the Camp fire, is experiencing air quality conditions considered unsafe for anyone to go outside. The EPA measured an AQI of 238 in San Francisco on Friday.\n\nNorthern Californians take their good air for granted. Last year, San Francisco had 276 days with an AQI rating of \u201cgood.\u201d The average AQI in Delhi is \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Golden Gate Bridge is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires Friday.\n\nMany schools and universities throughout the Bay Area have closed in recent days due to the poor air quality. Public schools in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano and Marin counties canceled classes on Friday due to the poor air quality. The University of California, Berkeley, San Francisco State University, California State University East Bay and other colleges closed their campuses, as well. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a \u201cSpare the Air\u201d alert effective from Thursday through Tuesday that includes a ban on \u201cburning wood, including manufactured fire logs or any other solid fuel, indoors or outdoors.\u201d\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s famous cable cars were shut down on Friday.\n\nAuthorities also urged residents to stay indoors and to wear a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, marked N95 or higher, if and when they need to go outdoors.\n\nOne ACE hardware store in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district was out of masks Tuesday night but told customers a shipment of 1,000 more would be in the next morning. By Wednesday night, they were out again.\n\nThe shortage is standard across the city. Many vendors have limited customers to four masks per person. That limit has gone down to two in some places as supplies have dwindled.\n\nSmoke entering through the state\u2019s Central Valley is hovering in Bay Area counties, unable to escape through the Golden Gate, the National Weather Service explained. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of high daytime temperatures and low evening ones has triggered a phenomenon that traps the smoke close to the ground.\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS Pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District wear protective masks against the hazardous air.\n\nThe particulates in wildfire smoke also have a somewhat different chemical makeup than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources of pollution. And it comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire, which may present a different set of risks.\n\nNext to the immediate loss of life from the Camp fire, the air quality may seem a distant secondary concern. But how the poor air may affect survivors and other surrounding residents in the long term poses a frightening prospect.\n\nInhalation of PM 2.5 particles has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues. PM exposure has also been linked to increased kidney disease risk and shortened life spans of those exposed to it in the womb.\n\nHazy conditions in the Bay Area are projected to persist over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. As for now, people\u2019s hope for relief from the smoke hinges on a chance of rain that may help clean the air late next week."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-19 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cI\u2019ve said many times before that we were too slow to spot Russian interference and we certainly stumbled along the way,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a press conference, \u201cbut to suggest we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth or wanted to hide what we knew or wanted to prevent investigations is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nThe platform also issued a separate statement on its blog Wednesday, announcing that it had severed ties with Definers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2015 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization.

As much as some House Democrats, including several among the wave of newcomers elected this month, say they want to shake up a calcified party leadership, would-be challengers are keenly aware of the immense power Ms. Pelosi wields, and fearful of institutional retribution and reputational damage if they step forward to test the status quo.\n\nDemocrats who had hoped to release a letter clearly demonstrating that Ms. Pelosi did not have the votes to become speaker pulled back on Friday, hoping to garner more than the 17 signatures that they said they had collected.

A joint project between Duke and Yale\u2019s Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science, published this fall in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research, found that when certain popular flavors are added to a common solvent in the vaping liquids, they produce chemicals that irritate airways and lungs. A 2016 study in the journal Chest said that smoking e-cigarettes had an effect on the heart and arteries which, while was not as pronounced as that of combustible cigarettes, was still distinctive.\n\nImage The e-cigarettes are extremely discreet, making them particularly popular among high school and even middle school students.

Its potent addictive properties, doctors say, can be most pronounced in teenagers.\n\n******\n\nAfter a few weeks of bumming daily hits from friends (called \u201cfiending\u201d), Matt went on a family vacation out West. On his second day without a Juul, he found he wanted one desperately. On the third, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nHe searched Juul\u2019s website to find a local store that sold it, and ordered an Uber to get there, mumbling a nonchalant excuse to relatives. Between the cost of the ride service plus the Juul \u201cstarter\u201d kit, he spent $100 to sate his need.\n\nSoon, he escalated to a daily pod, sometimes more.

If indeed a ban on menthol cigarettes is enacted, he said, \u201cJuul is in a good position to offer an alternative product for smokers who are used to their menthol flavor. Because Juul has market dominance, they stand to benefit from an ultimate ban.\u201d\n\nBut a prohibition against menthol cigarettes would have to clear the usual federal regulatory hurdles, a process that could take at least two years.

Users inhale and exhale the vapor. The devices come in numerous shapes, including ones that look like pens, flash drives and hookahs. Many consumers are confused about the health implications of e-cigarettes. This is a primer about what research so far shows about these devices.\n\nAre they safer than traditional cigarettes?\n\nYes. But that does not mean they are safe.\n\nE-cigarettes contain far fewer dangerous chemicals than those released in burning tobacco. Tobacco cigarettes typically contain 7,000 chemicals, including nearly 70 known to be carcinogenic. E-cigarettes also don\u2019t release tar, the tobacco residue that damages lungs but also contributes to the flavor of tobacco products. In the United States, cigarettes are associated with 480,000 deaths a year from coronary heart disease, stroke and numerous cancers, among other illnesses.\n\nThe research on e-cigarettes is young because the products have only been around for a little over a decade. Exacerbated by the voltage of a given device, certain e-cigarette flavors can irritate the airways, researchers say: benzaldehyde (added to cherry flavored liquids), cinnamaldehyde (gives cinnamon flavor), and diacetyl (a buttery flavor that can cause lung tissue damage called \u201cpopcorn lung.\u201d) Some flavors become irritants when added to vaping liquids. The process of turning liquid chemicals into vapor releases harmful particulates deep into the lungs and atmosphere, including heavy metals."}]
