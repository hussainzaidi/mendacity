But that does not mean this is a crisis dodged for Trump and he is now free from fresh legal and political jeopardy. Quite the reverse.\n\nAt the very least, the latest developments underline how Trump's senior subordinates may have shielded a President unschooled in constitutional norms from disastrous steps that could have put his presidency in peril.\n\nAnd it leaves anyone on the outside wondering what other potential disasters top officials like McGahn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might have prevented.\n\nThey also raise questions about the capacity of a now-understaffed White House and legal counsel's operation to protect the President from current or future transgressions.\n\nIt will be impossible to confirm, given the habitual silence from the special counsel's office, but the revelations hint at the possibility that Robert Mueller knows much more about what went on in the corridors of the West Wing than has been publicly revealed.\n\nThat will play into rising tensions in Washington amid expectations that the endgame of Mueller's probe is in sight and speculation about possible indictments targeting Trump world and the content of his final report.\n\nBombshell reports by CNN and The New York Times about the President's intentions emerged on another surreal day in Washington that saw shocking disclosures about Ivanka Trump's emails and a huge foreign policy pivot over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey will bolster perceptions that Trump views the Justice Department as an instrument of his personal power rather than an insulated government department responsible for the neutral administration of justice.\n\nTrump had forecast his intentions\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the President, on multiple occasions, asked Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then chief of staff to the attorney general, how they were doing in investigating Clinton.\n\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked McGahn to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and fired FBI Director Comey but that he had been rebuffed.\n\nThe paper, lifting the lid on extreme pressure faced by top law enforcement officials in the US government, also said Trump had repeatedly criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray for failing to more aggressively investigate Clinton, calling him weak.\n\nIt is not surprising that Trump would call for such prosecutions. He has frequently said as much on the campaign trail and on Twitter and beamed as his crowds chanted \"lock her up,\" referring to his 2016 election foe.\n\nBut that he would actually believe he has the power to follow through on his demands and such action would be politically acceptable is the most alarming takeaway from the reports.\n\nA prosecution of Clinton -- possibly over her private email server or an Obama-era uranium deal struck with Russia, both while she was secretary of state -- would have challenged the fundamentals of the political system itself. American democracy since George Washington, the first president, has been assured by the peaceful transfer of power between often bitter rivals. In a saga that became embroiled in the 2016 election, the FBI investigated Clinton's email use, but declined to recommend charges.\n\nMobilizing the government's prosecutorial powers against Comey would represent a vindictive swipe against a political enemy, a worrying sign in itself.\n\nBut it could also have led Trump onto perilous legal ground because he fired Comey and then told NBC News he had done so because of the Russia investigation -- which Comey was then leading -- raising concerns that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far 01:35\n\nThe dismissal made the former FBI director a key witness in the probe, which was taken over by Mueller shortly after Comey was forced out. Using the federal government to target such a witness would risk playing into the obstruction of justice case that Mueller is investigating, since it could offer evidence for the question of whether the President had acted with malicious intent.\n\nJosh Campbell, who served as an aide to Comey at the FBI and is now a CNN analyst, said his former boss was shaking his head at reports that the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\nComey wrote in his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" which came out earlier this year, that Trump often reminded him of a mafia boss and sent him back to his days prosecuting the mob, especially with the President's demands for personal loyalty.\n\nRenewed scrutiny of Matt Whitaker\n\nThe latest revelations also cast new scrutiny on Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's elevation, and past criticism of the Mueller probe, sparked concerns that he was put in place to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nA source told CNN's Pamela Brown that Whitaker, in his former role, came to meetings with Trump prepared to answer how the Justice Department was pursuing investigations against the Clinton Foundation and on the Uranium One issue, over a mining company whose sale to Russia's atomic energy agency had been approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe source said Whitaker tried to appease the President and there was no sign that he had crossed a line.\n\nWhitaker is now in a role in which he oversees the Mueller probe, and thus could face intense pressure from a President who has made no secret of his disdain for an investigation he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhen Trump first requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, the Times said. The paper also reported that McGahn had gone so far as to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a request.\n\nIn many ways, the latest reports underline how Trump, a neophyte in Washington when he was inaugurated in January 2017, does not appreciate or respect normal boundaries between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nThey also suggest how if he is not constrained, the President could accidentally stumble into a position that contravenes the Constitution and puts his presidency in jeopardy.\n\nThat possibility seems to be exacerbated by Trump's increasing self-confidence in a White House that may be about to be deprived of many remaining restraining influences in a government reshuffle.\n\nTuesday's reports recalled an exchange in a Clinton/Trump presidential debate in 2016, when the Democratic nominee remarked that it was good that someone with her rival's temperament wasn't running the country.\n\n\"Because you would be in jail,\" Trump replied."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump wanted the Justice Department to investigate Clinton", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/EfHczYKL9uI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on multiple occasions raised with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then-chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, whether the Justice Department was progressing in investigating Hillary Clinton, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe President also wanted his previous White House counsel, Don McGahn, to ask the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton on numerous occasions, but McGahn rebuffed doing that, the source said.\n\nAnticipating the question about Clinton would be raised, Whitaker came prepared to answer with what Justice was doing on Clinton-related matters, including the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One investigations, the source said. The source added that Whitaker was trying to appease the President, but did not seem to cross any line.\n\nReached Tuesday by CNN analyst Josh Campbell -- who formerly served as an aide to Comey at the FBI -- the fired director said he was shaking his head at reports the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him, Campbell said on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said.\n\nCampbell said Comey noted that he was pleased The New York Times made clear in its story that he had not divulged classified information, a claim Trump and his allies have made.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nIn March, then-Attorney General Sessions revealed that Utah's top federal prosecutor, John Huber, was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign adviser, and claims that more should have been done to investigate Clinton's ties to a Russian nuclear energy agency, which have not been proven.\n\nAnd in January, CNN reported that the US attorney and FBI in Arkansas were investigating allegations of corruption related to the Clinton Foundation. The FBI and federal prosecutors are looking into whether donors to the foundation were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers, as well as whether tax-exempt funds were misused, the official said. A spokesman for Clinton dismissed the allegations as unfounded.\n\nWilliam Burck, a lawyer for McGahn, issued a statement following the Times report that said the President hadn't ordered prosecutions of Clinton or Comey.\n\n\"Mr. McGahn will not comment on his legal advice to the president. Like any client, the president is entitled to confidentiality. Mr. McGahn would point out, though, that the president never, to his knowledge, ordered that anyone prosecute Hillary Clinton or James Comey,\" Burck said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nWhen Trump requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President that he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, and even requesting an investigation could be a step too far, the Times reported. McGahn went on to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a demand for Trump, according to the report.\n\nTrump has long called for legal action against Clinton, his Democratic rival in 2016, over her private email use as secretary of state, and he has alleged that Comey, who he fired as FBI director last year, leaked classified information.\n\nMcGahn left the White House in October, a long-planned departure that followed a tenure marked in part by friction with the President.\n\nWhitaker, meanwhile, was tapped as acting attorney general over Rosenstein after Trump fired Sessions earlier this month. Democrats have decried Whitaker's appointment in part because of his previous comments criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which he now supervises.\n\nTrump said during his campaign that he would seek to use the presidency to direct an investigation against Clinton, and since taking office he has repeatedly railed against the Justice Department for the special counsel investigation's focus on his associates rather than investigations into his political opponents.\n\nTrump engaged in a war of words with Sessions several months before the Alabama Republican was fired, and the President said on Twitter that Sessions should investigate Democrats and \"Comey lies.\"\n\nCNN reported prior to McGahn's official exit that Trump was unnerved about the extent of McGahn's personal cooperation with Mueller's investigation -- cooperation that included some 30 hours of interviews with Mueller's team.\n\nBut McGahn's time in the White House also saw him in a central role shaping the federal judiciary and helping to shepherd Trump's picks for the Supreme Court through the Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Ex-WH counsel: Trump going to level Nixon never went to", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/YM1XYL1c5OQ/john-dean-donald-trump-clinton-comey-nyt-sot-berman-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "John Dean, one of the central figures in the Watergate scandal, said that even Former President Richard Nixon would say President Donald Trump is \"going too far,\" in response to the New York Times report saying that Trump wanted to order the DOJ to prosecute James Comey and Hillary Clinton."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump sends finished written answers to Mueller", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Fum_0wTxVfI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday submitted written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller related to the investigation of possible collusion between Trump associates and Russians.\n\nThe responses from the President signify a major development in the Mueller probe following months of negotiations between the special counsel's office and Trump's legal team, and could be a sign of the end stages of the investigation.\n\nTrump told reporters before boarding Marine One to travel to Mar-a-Lago in Florida that he finished the written answers on Monday and provided them to his lawyers. \"The written answers are finished,\" Trump said. \"The written answers to the witch hunt that's been going on forever.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought Mueller would be fair, Trump said he hopes so.\n\n\"The President today answered written questions submitted by the special counsel's office,\" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \"The questions presented dealt with issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry.

Adam Schiff (\"little Adam Schitt\") to the special counsel Robert Mueller (\"gone absolutely nuts.\") The myth holds that Trump is a tough guy who fights back. In fact, he is a fragile man running out of safe places to hide.\n\nLike so much about Trump, the counter-puncher theme is a clever marketing ploy used to obscure obvious flaws. In the past he promoted himself as a business titan to cover the shame of multiple massive bankruptcies. Today, as a politician, he poses as a victim when he's actually a frightened bully. No one is ever on equal footing with the President of the United States, which means that whenever he \"punches\" anyone, he lowers himself.\n\nWho does Trump fear? He fears the independent counsel, whose investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election threatens to expose the inner workings of the campaign and of Trump's opaque business empire. He fears Schiff and other House Democrats he's belittled because they will soon chair powerful committees that will launch their own investigations into Trump's administration and, perhaps, his long-hidden tax returns.\n\nThe President's insecurities all seem to revolve around his fear of being unmasked as a fraud. The tax returns, for example, would allow everyone to compare his claims to great wealth -- in 2015 he said he was worth $10 billion -- with black-and-white reality. More to the point, we could all see how he has benefited from various tax maneuvers and discover just how much corporate welfare the Trump Organization has lapped up over the years.\n\nBeyond his finances, Trump fears being revealed to be a na\u00eff who has been outplayed by others with power. In the case of the Saudi killing of American-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump seems afraid to listen to the audio evidence Turkish officials handed over to the United States. He seems to be in denial about what his brutal pals are willing to do.\n\nTrump's first overseas trip as President began with a stop in Riyadh, where he joined in a ceremonial dance and went all in with one of the most repressive regimes on Earth.\n\nThe desperation in Trump's denial, whether it has to do with Khashoggi's killing or domestic politics, can be seen in the tortured effort he makes to persuade us that what we see with our own eyes isn't true.\n\nThe results of the 2018 election are a perfect case in point. Trump's instinct brought him to frame the election as a \"tremendous success,\" even as his party lost control of the House and he became vulnerable to the opposition for the first time in his presidency.\n\nTrump likely failed to detect the nation's displeasure with him, and his party, because he is apparently afraid to go anywhere outside the parts of the country where he's sure to draw an adoring crowd. (His did make a brief trip to California after the campaign in the wake of the deadly wildfires.)\n\nThe America he saw at his rallies was whiter, more rural and less educated than America overall. Obviously wary of any place where he wouldn't be hailed as a hero, he didn't hold a single rally in the Northeast or on the West Coast. In both those regions, Republicans suffered major election losses. If timid Trump had taken the risk of going to these places, he might have had a more realistic sense of how he is faring. But information that runs counter to the narrative he prefers may make him uncomfortable.\n\nJUST WATCHED Berman: The President is a counter-puncher Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Berman: The President is a counter-puncher 02:55\n\nThe President's need for safe spaces is not just a matter of campaign strategy. In March, USA Today noted that Trump had seen less of the country than any president in 40 years. Whenever possible Trump has traveled to his own properties -- the Mar-a-Lago resort is a favorite -- where he can surround himself with sycophants, rest in his own comfy bed and tweet insults at the people he fears.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that Trump \"has spoken privately about his fears over risks to his own life, according to a former senior White House official.\" The unnamed official said, \"He's afraid of those situations. He's afraid people want to kill him.\"\n\nA bit of concern would be natural, but as the ultimate VIP, a president who goes to Iraq or Afghanistan, for example, should not tremble. (Obama went to both in his first 14 months in office.) But like any man who brags about how much he loves to fight, Trump long ago revealed himself to be a fearful fellow. Face to face with real combat troops he might be confronted with actual courage and feel diminished\n\nComfort is prized by our fragile-flower President, who spins fantasies of denial to avoid painful realities. His recent interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News was a frightened fantasist's tour de force. \"I did well in France,\" he says after a trip where he skipped a ceremony to honor the war dead because, he claims, fog kept his helicopter grounded and the Secret Service forbade him to travel by car. In fact, the Secret Service cannot order a president to do anything, and other heads of state made the trek to honor the dead.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

He has been Architecture and Design critic of the UK's Guardian and the Independent. He began his career with the Architectural Review. He is a member of the Committee of International Architectural Critics. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nWhat and where is the world's best new building? Today, the judges of the 2018 RIBA International Prize have announced that it's a pair of school boarding houses (named \"Children Village\") set in a remote rural location on the fringes of enormous rice fields in Brazil's tropical Tocantins province some 370 miles north east of Bras\u00edlia and 930 miles from the sea.\n\nSo that's two buildings? Technically speaking, yes, although these timber structures are mirror images of one another, so a prize given to one is an award made to both.\n\n\"The best new building in the world,\" said Elizabeth Diller of the US practice Diller Scofidio + Renfro and chair of the 2018 RIBA International Prize jury, \"needs to wake us out of our everyday stupor to something challenging that teaches us why architecture is still relevant.\"\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nThe spacious and effortlessly gracious new boarding houses of the Canuan\u00e3 School at Formoso do Araguaia, designed by Rosenbaum + Aleph Zero, exactly meet Diller's criterion. They are both intelligent architecture and a wake-up call.\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nEschewing air conditioning and even glazing, they open up to the countryside around them, a land, that aside from cattle ranching and the cultivation of rice, cassava, maize and watermelons, is home to thermal pools, white sand riverine beaches, orchids, blue herons, jaguars, alligators, endangered Amazonian trees, cattle ranching and indigenous Av\u00e1-Canoeiros tribes people, who choose to have no contact with what we call civilization.\n\nHow architecture can help education\n\nThe Canuan\u00e3 School educates children from local towns and settlements, as well as from far-flung ranches and encampments, and so the need for dormitories for up to 540 students. The dormitories are clustered in nine groups of five adobe brick structures in each building, under vast single and gently sloping white metallic roofs -- sloped to deal with the drainage of tropical rain -- supported by slim laminated eucalyptus columns that seem barely to touch the ground.\n\nThe dormitories are set around large courtyards planted with local trees and vegetation. Each dormitory is home to just six 13 to 18-year old students, and is kitted out with storage space, lavatories, showers and laundry. Steam evaporates through perforated bricks, while rainwater spilling from the big roof is collected in a pool alive with small local fish in a central courtyard. Storm water is channeled into the nearby Rio Java\u00e9s.\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nWooden stairs lead up from courtyards and dormitories to play areas, reading and TV rooms sheltered from the elements by ventilated timber screens. There are also spaces to loll in hammocks and upper walkways with views across the school campus, with its established classrooms, refectory and clinic, and out to a boundless horizontal green landscape and as far as any student's keen eye can see.\n\nRaising the bar of design\n\nWhat is so special about this pair of buildings book-ending the school campus is that it raises the expectations of students and teachers as surely as it raises the cultural sights of a town and province where few, if any, visitors would ever have come before to look at architecture.\n\nThe \"Children Village\" buildings also belong here in Tocantins as surely and deservedly as jaguars and blue herons. As Gloria Cabral of Paraguay's Gabinete de Arquitectura and one of the five RIBA International Prize jury members put it in an interview, the buildings are \"really pertinent, appropriate for this place, for this culture, for this weather, these landscapes and at the same time an example for all the world.\"\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nFunded by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Bradesco, an educational charity and offshoot of Brazil's Bradesco Bank, these new buildings are both rigorous in terms of engineering and planning and thoroughly rational in those of structure and materials and yet they exude an effortless air of delight and even festivity.\n\n\"We tend to think of architecture,\" said fellow judge, Peter Clegg of Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios (UK), \"as being a slightly arrogant discipline, flashy and extravagant. Here is an example of a really beautiful building where everything is well considered, and it's very low cost, very low carbon, very creative and a beautiful set of living spaces for these very lucky children.\"\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nThe architects, Aleph Zero, are a young Brazilian practice led by Gustavo Utrabo and Pedro Duschenes. They have worked in collaboration, especially on the interiors of the buildings, with Marcelo Rosenbaum, the Brazilian designer and television host. The design of the boarding houses is, in large part, a result of immersive discussions between architects, designer, students and teachers.\n\nSouth America in the spotlight\n\nIn 2016, the inaugural biennial RIBA International Prize was awarded to the UTEC Universidad de Ingener\u00eda y Technolog\u00eda in Lima, Peru -- \" a modern day Machu Picchu ,\" said the judges -- and it might seem too much of a good thing to witness a South American education project winning the prize a second time around, especially with so many fascinating buildings to choose from around the world.\n\n\"Children Village\" is the winner of RIBA's International Prize 2018 Credit: Cristobal Palma / Estudio Palma\n\nSouth America, though, is an ideal crucible for the forging of a new and responsible 21st century architecture. Here is not just a country -- Brazil -- but a continent with relatively limited means but great potential, with populations calling for first class education, healthcare and public services that will allow them to thrive. Imaginative and skilled architects are proving that truly inspirational design using local skills and materials, the sun for power and the wind for ventilation, can not only meet the challenges faced but give rise to a new generation of buildings that are being recognized as among the best in the modern world.\n\nLong before Formoso do Araguaia was properly settled from the late 1940s, Portuguese venturers came this way in search of gold. Now Aleph Zero and Marcelo Rosenbaum -- architects and alchemists -- have forged a new gold in modest timber rather than precious metal.

MUST WATCH Carlos Ghosn's rise and fall 01:38\n\nHe was made CEO of Renault in 2005, becoming the first executive to run two Fortune Global 500 companies simultaneously. Mitsubishi joined the alliance in 2016, when Nissan took a controlling stake in the smaller Japanese carmaker.\n\nThe companies are linked through a complicated series of equity stakes. Nissan and Renault own pieces of each other, but Nissan's stake in its French partner does not come with voting rights. Nissan also has a 34% stake in Mitsubishi. Politics is a factor: The French state maintains 15% ownership in Renault.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier Tuesday that he would meet with representatives from Renault to discuss appointing interim management because Ghosn is \"no longer capable of leading the group.\"\n\nFuture of the alliance\n\nGhosn's latest project was to deepen ties between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi. The alliance structure, which allows the companies to pool resources and share costs, has been explored by other carmakers in recent years.\n\nMany top executives in the alliance report to three separate CEOs \u2014 but Ghosn held it all together. The big question now is whether the alliance can survive without him.\n\nGhosn told the Financial Times in June that the alliance he forged was \"irreversible.\"\n\n\"We created a lot of synergies, and scale is the name of the game. But I respect that some stakeholders are saying, 'Hey, wait a minute, what's gonna happen after you're gone?' \" he told the newspaper.\n\nThe carmakers could struggle to compete on their own should the alliance break up. The auto industry is under intense pressure to develop mass-market electric cars and autonomous vehicles. Tech companies are eager to beat them to the punch.\n\nThe governments of France and Japan appear determined to keep it alive. They issued a joint statement on Tuesday reaffirming their support for the alliance and calling it \"one of the greatest symbols of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "The worst year to be a human has been revealed (and no, it's not 2018)", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/Nakof8PnX6U/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It's easy to look back on the past through rose-tinted glasses, as the saying goes, but new research suggests that the mid-sixth century was definitely a time to forget.\n\nA team of historians and scientists has identified A.D. 536 as the beginning of a terrible sequence of events for humankind.\n\nA massive volcanic eruption spewed a huge cloud of ash that shrouded the Northern Hemisphere in darkness and caused a drop in temperatures that led to crop failure and starvation, said co-lead study author Professor Christopher Loveluck of the University of Nottingham in the UK.\n\nThen the misery was compounded in A.D. 542 as cold and hungry populations in the eastern Roman Empire were struck by the bubonic plague.\n\nNow, in collaboration with glaciologist Paul Mayewski at the Climate Change Institute of the University of Maine in Orono, Loveluck's team has identified the source of the cloud.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Two held in Denver shooting that left 1 dead, 4 injured", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/EShwa6B5vWY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "Denver (CNN) Two suspects have been arrested in connection with a shooting in downtown Denver that left one man dead and four others wounded, police said Tuesday.\n\nMonday's incident occurred just after 4 p.m. near Coors Field at Lawrence and 21st streets.\n\nOne person died at the scene and four others were taken to the hospital, police said.\n\nTwo patients were in serious condition Tuesday, Denver Health tweeted.

It sparked public outrage, prompted an investigation and led to calls for reform.\n\nBut the misplaced gun debacle was hardly an isolated incident, according to documents recently obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration's Office of Inspection has documented more than 200 cases of air marshals allegedly misusing firearms or misbehaving with guns between roughly 2005 and 2017, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe cases ranged from seemingly mundane issues, such as improper storage of weapons, to situations in which air marshals allegedly jeopardized public safety.\n\nIn 19 of the cases, air marshals allegedly fired their weapons accidentally. For example, the documents state that in 2017 an agent based in Charlotte, North Carolina, \"unintentionally discharged a personally owned firearm resulting in a gunshot wound to his right foot.\"\n\nA 2013 case described an air marshal mistakenly firing his weapon inside a hotel room and damaging a television in an adjoining room.\n\nMore than 70 of the incidents relate to lost, misplaced or stolen weapons. At least three of those cases involved air marshals forgetting their firearms in airplane bathrooms. Two others involved weapons misplaced in airports.\n\nOn one occasion, an air marshal allegedly left his gun inside a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Totowa, New Jersey. In another, an investigation was launched after police found a \"range bag\" containing a gun box and ammunition in a school park.\n\nAt least 13 of the cases involved alcohol, including a 2012 case in which an armed air marshal allegedly flew on a plane while drunk and another in 2014 in which an agent was accused of being intoxicated during a firearms training session.\n\nThe TSA touts federal air marshals as elite officers who receive extensive firearms training that surpasses the standards within many other law enforcement agencies. In a statement to CNN, Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for the air marshals, said the cases involved less than 1% of its workforce.\n\n\"All reports of misconduct are taken seriously and fully investigated. When those investigations validate any misconduct, TSA takes swift disciplinary actions,\" said Kelly, who added, \"we are proud of the highly skilled and trained Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) who keep our skies safe every day.\"\n\nThe documents from TSA's Office of Inspection, which audits and inspects TSA operations, do not stipulate whether the allegations of misconduct were substantiated, or whether the air marshals involved were disciplined. The records also did not identify the employees by name.\n\nTSA has investigated 35 incidents in which air marshals were alleged to have unintentionally or inappropriately discharged or brandished weapons between 2007 and 2017. Of those, 27 incidents were substantiated and resulted in disciplinary action, while eight were cleared with no action taken.\n\nTSA did not share the number and outcome of investigations of other types of alleged misconduct involving firearms described in the documents.\n\nHow the cases compare to rates of misconduct with firearms within other law enforcement agencies is unclear because the total number of air marshals is classified. However, former air marshals say any mishap with a firearm is unacceptable because of the unique sensitivity of aviation security.\n\n\"When you're in an airport around thousands of people or in an airplane that's essentially a small tube 30,000 feet in the air, you have to be incredibly accurate. You can't make mistakes,\" said Henry Preston, a former air marshal and training instructor who retired in 2014.\n\nPreston and four other former air marshals reached by CNN said they observed inconsistencies in \"recurrent training\" during their time with the Federal Air Marshal Service, such as disagreements among instructors on how to enforce marksmanship and safety standards.\n\nAir marshals are required to undergo recurrent training that includes quarterly marksmanship evaluations and annual off-range safety courses, but a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found the air marshal service did not have complete and timely data on the extent to which its officers completed that training. Kelly, the air marshal spokesman, said TSA has implemented the GAO's recommendations on how to better evaluate air marshal training.\n\nThree of the cases in the documents obtained by CNN related to misconduct during firearms training.\n\nIn 2013, for example, an air marshal instructor \"committed egregious safety violations\" by allegedly throwing a handful of expired simulation ammunition into an open fire during a training exercise, according to the records. The ammunition exploded and flying debris hit one staff member in the face, the documents state.\n\nDaniel Kowal, a current supervisory air marshal and section chief at the agency's training facility near Atlantic City, New Jersey, said that while any case of misconduct is embarrassing, the Federal Air Marshal Service prides itself on rigorous firearms training and strives for zero errors.\n\n\"When we hear incidents like this, we immediately convene a panel to address them and we look at what was the underlying cause, what happened, if and when the training failed, how and why did it fail, and how do we plug that gap,\" Kowal said.\n\nIn addition to recurrent training, all air marshals must first go through a 16-week training course that starts with basic law enforcement techniques, taught in New Mexico, and ends with more advanced weapons-handling and other skills taught at the Atlantic City facility, where CNN observed training in action.\n\nKowal said air marshals must achieve a minimum marksmanship score of 255 out of 300, which he described as the highest firearms qualification standard in federal law enforcement, and he said air marshals have an average individual score of about 283.\n\nBrian Borek, who represents air marshals as agency president at the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, told CNN some field offices do an excellent job with recurrent training, while disparities exist at others because of limitations on size, resources and personnel. He said that doesn't make them less effective, \"just different and limited.\"\n\n\"These challenges are not unique to FAMS agency, however. This exists at all large-scale organizations. This in no way translates to the readiness or skill set of air marshals. They are the best in the world,\" Borek said.\n\nThe incidents of misconduct with firearms adds to a history of controversies that have plagued the Federal Air Marshal Service. Several former air marshals reached by CNN said that in addition to inconsistencies in recurrent training, grueling hours, low morale and even alcoholism affect the mission-readiness of many air marshals.\n\n\"There are systemic problems within the culture that affect the men and women doing the job,\" said Clay Biles, a former air marshal who wrote a book about the agency, titled \"Unsecure Skies.\"\n\nIn 2012, a commissioned study conducted by the Division of Sleep Medicine of Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School found that 75% of air marshals flying domestic missions were sleep-deficient. The study stated air marshals suffering from fatigue have increased risk of \"self-injury\" and \"greater incidence of serious errors.\"\n\nIn 2015, CNN reported that 10 federal air marshals had killed themselves since 2002, and representatives of the Air Marshal Association said job stress contributed to those deaths. At least two of the cases in the TSA Office of Inspection documents obtained by CNN involved alleged suicides by air marshals.\n\nThe New York Times reported in April that the TSA has had to monitor whether air marshals show up for their flights sober. The TSA said its Office of Inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure mission readiness.\n\nSome government reports have indicated money spent on some air marshal programs would be more effective in funding other forms of aviation security. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general found that the air marshal service's \"contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable.\"\n\nA document obtained by CNN in August showed a TSA proposal to reduce the federal air marshal program that would save the agency nearly $39 million per year.\n\nJohn Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University who has assessed the efficiencies of various forms of aviation security, argues that the costs of air marshals outweigh their benefits. He recommends training and arming more pilots to resist hijackers and adding secondary cockpit barriers.\n\nReferring to air marshals, Mueller said, \"They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them. There are much less expensive security measures, which could replace them and save lots of money.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "What do you take when you only have minutes to flee a wildfire?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/wLoWgExTZ2I/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "And time is running out.\n\nThe wildfires raging through California have already claimed 80 lives just this month.

They happened to be all in one location,\" Clunies-Ross told CNN. \"That's what saved that stuff.\"\n\nSome of the family's clothes and their toiletries were already packed, left from a trip to Oregon the week before.

She still hadn't received an alert to evacuate.\n\nThe 39-year-old made several trips to her car and noticed the fire was spreading quickly. A fire had appeared in her front lawn and the next time she looked, a man came out of nowhere and put it out for her.\n\nA few framed photos, her daughter's stuffed bunny and some of her husband's favorite vintage T-shirts also made it out.\n\nTheir home, made of cedar, didn't make it. \"It looks like a house was never there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm glad I have my family,\" she said. \"At the same time, nothing else really matters in the mix of it all.

Nervous, her 20-year-old daughter pleaded for them to pack.\n\nShe gathered her passport and important documents and told her daughter they'd pack up a few things and assess the situation in the morning.\n\nIn the middle of the night, more alerts came -- the fire was coming at the 10-acre property from two directions, she said.\n\nStanwood Terranova's house was more than a home -- it was also her business and a retreat center she called a \"sacred place.\" She's a licensed spiritual counselor.\n\nShe sent her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend on their way and spent one hour going through the house and property. She opened the property's gates so firefighters could enter, packed items and she blessed each room of the house.\n\nStanwood Terranova stood in front of her library, asking herself what she couldn't live without. She took her two favorite books that she teaches from, each one filled with notes in the margins. Right above those, she reached for the many journals she's kept over the past 20 to 30 years, as well as the ones she wrote for her two children.\n\nShe took her computers, the start of the book she's been writing and all her business contacts.\n\nShe forgot to take any clothes with her, having to purchase some after she evacuated. She left a \"beautiful necklace sitting on the counter,\" but said she didn't care.\n\nHer two bull mastiffs, Brando and Juliet, were the first thing she loaded in the car and then came whatever else there was room for. Otherwise there wasn't much. \"I truly thought I was coming home,\" she said.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m., she evacuated for Ojai.\n\nShe later found out her home and business were destroyed by the fire.

The source added that Whitaker was trying to appease the President, but did not seem to cross any line.\n\nReached Tuesday by CNN analyst Josh Campbell -- who formerly served as an aide to Comey at the FBI -- the fired director said he was shaking his head at reports the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him, Campbell said on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said.\n\nCampbell said Comey noted that he was pleased The New York Times made clear in its story that he had not divulged classified information, a claim Trump and his allies have made.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nIn March, then-Attorney General Sessions revealed that Utah's top federal prosecutor, John Huber, was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling a former Trump campaign adviser, and claims that more should have been done to investigate Clinton's ties to a Russian nuclear energy agency, which have not been proven.\n\nAnd in January, CNN reported that the US attorney and FBI in Arkansas were investigating allegations of corruption related to the Clinton Foundation. The FBI and federal prosecutors are looking into whether donors to the foundation were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers, as well as whether tax-exempt funds were misused, the official said. A spokesman for Clinton dismissed the allegations as unfounded.\n\nWilliam Burck, a lawyer for McGahn, issued a statement following the Times report that said the President hadn't ordered prosecutions of Clinton or Comey.\n\n\"Mr. McGahn will not comment on his legal advice to the president.

McGahn went on to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a demand for Trump, according to the report.\n\nTrump has long called for legal action against Clinton, his Democratic rival in 2016, over her private email use as secretary of state, and he has alleged that Comey, who he fired as FBI director last year, leaked classified information.\n\nMcGahn left the White House in October, a long-planned departure that followed a tenure marked in part by friction with the President.\n\nWhitaker, meanwhile, was tapped as acting attorney general over Rosenstein after Trump fired Sessions earlier this month.

Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blasted Trump's response.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\" he tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nAnd it may deepen the estrangement between Trump and the intelligence community, given his rejection of a CIA assessment that the crown prince knew about the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nNo room for misunderstanding\n\nTrump's statement was remarkable because it was not just an explanation of Saudi policy. He consciously used the moment to deliver a lesson about how he would wield American power as he redefined the nation's role in the world.\n\nHe essentially argued that although the murder of the Washington Post journalist was \"terrible\" and could not be condoned, it did not merit the disruption of a strategic relationship he has elevated to extraordinary levels.\n\n\"We're not going to give up hundreds of millions of dollars in orders and let Russia and China have them ... it's a very simple equation for me.

MUST WATCH Ward: US saying it doesn't care about Khashoggi 02:27\n\nHis decision appeared to suggest that as long as a foreign power enriches the United States it would face no censure for despotic behavior.\n\nPerhaps Trump should get marks for frankness.\n\nMany Presidents have wrestled with the tension between American values and the trade-offs required by realpolitik. Often Washington's actions -- in the Vietnam War for instance or in the war on terror, have been seen by outsiders as falling well short of the lofty principles it has preached to others.\n\nAmerican relations with Saudi Arabia, a key power broker in the Middle East and crucial oil producer vital to the global economy have often fallen on the hypocritical side of this line.\n\nBut the pull of the idea that America is leading a group of like-minded nations wedded to democratic, enlightened principles was always strong and while waxing and waning under different Presidents it never disappeared.\n\nYet Trump is getting rid of any pretense. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it: \"It's a mean nasty world out there,\" in an apparent sign that Washington is ready to play the same cynical game as Beijing, Moscow and other challengers to Western power who reject the US-backed international system.\n\nTrump's pivot shocked many more conventional politicians in Washington.\n\n\"I am concerned about our standing in the world and what it says about the United States,\" Republican Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"From our very beginnings we have been a country founded on important principles of freedom, rule of law. The Declaration of Independence kind of sets the road map. And I don't think we want to back up on that and cut a break for Saudi Arabia murdering someone,\" Rooney said.\n\nYet Trump's argument will please his supporters, who reject the premise of the international liberal order and multinational institutions, and believe the previous Obama administration was ineffectual.\n\nAnd it represented the latest show of force from a President who is showing signs of breaking free from any remaining restraints, and is increasingly confident in a course that has sown historic disruption.\n\nConsequences in Washington and abroad\n\nTuesday's events were all more poignant since they coincided with Thanksgiving, the quintessentially American holiday that remembers pioneers who fled tyranny in Europe to found a land built on freedom in the new world.\n\nThey will have significant reverberations in Washington and around the world.\n\nAfter all, the President made clear he is willing to ignore his own intelligence agencies and to blur facts in order to advance his pre-cooked political goals -- in this case preserving the relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt is a trend that has also been evident in the President's dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin over election meddling and his rejection of intelligence agency assessments that Iran is abiding by a nuclear deal he overturned.\n\nTrump seems especially willing to disregard intelligence if it complicates his desire to court foreign despots like Putin, North Korea's Kim Jong Un or the crown prince.\n\nTrump's statement also included a Putin-esque misdirection play designed to cast doubt on the truth as well as it can be established -- that Khashoggi was murdered with the acquiescence of the Saudi crown prince.\n\n\"It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump wrote.\n\nHis words could hardly have offered more absolution to the House of Saud especially since the President also recycled Saudi talking points that Khashoggi was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn fact the President opened his statement talking not about Saudi Arabia but Iran, reflecting how US policy in the Middle East is refracted through a prism of the administration's fixation on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Saudis are seen by the Trump administration, and the President's personal envoy and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as crucial to containing the Islamic Republic -- a policy that looks increasingly like regime change.\n\nTo maintain that bond, the administration has offered logistical support to Riyadh's air assault against Iran backed rebels in Yemen, that has triggered the world's worst humanitarian crisis that has left eight million people at risk of famine. The administration has said it will stop refueling Saudi warplanes, but the air raids are still using US and Western ammunition.\n\nThe Saudi controversy will intensify Trump's coming clash with Congress with lawmakers determined to do more than levy sanctions on 17 Saudis named by their government as being involved in the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nSeveral bills would halt all arms sales to the Saudis. House Democrats may use their new majority next year to do more to probe the Trump-Saudi relationship.\n\nThere may be pressure to declassify the CIA assessment of Khashoggi's murder and attempts to reverse Trump's policy pivot.\n\n\"It's now up to Congress to reassure the people of Yemen and the international community that the United States still stands for something more than a dollar sign,\" said Oxfam America's Humanitarian Policy Lead, Scott Paul,\n\nThere are also calls for Congress to investigate Trump's past business ties with the Saudis.

He was a frequent critic of the Saudi regime. The Saudis initially denied any knowledge of his death, but then later said a group of rogue operators were responsible for his killing. But US officials have speculated that such a mission -- including the 15 men sent from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to murder him -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nLater in the day at a news conference, Trump said he was \"not going to destroy the economy of our country\" over Khashoggi's death by giving up arms deals to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday, \"One thing I learned during the Obama years is that when you look the other way regarding problems in the Middle East, it seldom works out.\"\n\nGraham said former President Barack Obama \"chose to look the other way as Iran took increasingly provocative actions,\" and said, \"Each time it led to even worse Iranian behavior and created even larger problems for the future.\"\n\n\"Likewise, it is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal #Khashoggi,\" Graham continued.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in its Istanbul consulate, five high-ranking officials were dismissed, including bin Salman's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service.\n\nKentucky Republican Sen.

Click to subscribe!\n\n\"Some aides were startled by the volume of Ivanka Trump's personal emails \u2014 and taken aback by her response when questioned about the practice. She said she was not familiar with some details of the rules, according to people with knowledge of her reaction.\"\n\nPeter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump lawyer Abbe Lowell, said something similar in a statement following the Post story. (Again, bolding is mine.)\n\n\"While transitioning into government, until the White House provided her the same guidance they had to others who started before she did, Ms. Trump sometimes used her private account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family,\" Mirijanian said.\n\nHow. Is. That. Possible.\n\nHow could Ivanka Trump have not known -- even prior to the White House providing her \"guidance\" -- that using a private email account to conduct official business was a giant no-no?\n\nAs you may remember, the central attack by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign centered on her decision to use a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. Trump insisted that Clinton was not being fully transparent about why she used a private email server for government business -- and used that as a foothold into a broader questioning of whether the former secretary of state could be trusted with the nation's top job.\n\n\"How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk,\" Trump tweeted in June 2016. A month later, he tweeted this : \"The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!\"\n\nThen there was the drama regarding the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails -- and whether she had broken any laws regarding the transmission of classified information by using a private account. Months after announcing the FBI would not press charges against Clinton, then-FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress indicating the investigation had been re-opened due to emails found on a laptop owned by former New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has blamed the Comey email announcement for her loss. \"There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\" Clinton told donors shortly after her defeat . \"Our analysis is that Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\"\n\nWhether you buy that explanation from Clinton is actually beside the point. The point is this: It is literally impossible to believe, after everything that transpired during the 2016 campaign regarding Clinton's use of a private email to conduct government business, that Ivanka Trump was simply unaware that what she was doing wasn't allowed. It's just not possible.\n\nTeam Ivanka was quick to note that the two situations weren't -- and aren't -- exactly the same. Again, Mirijanian:\n\n\"To address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump's personal email, she did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\"\n\nWhich, OK. Clinton did delete a large chunk of the emails she sent from her private account after someone working for her did a broad canvas of all the emails she had sent and determined that they were entirely personal and therefore could be deleted without sharing them with investigators. (Roughly 50% of the emails on Clinton's private server were deleted, while 44% were turned over to investigators.)\n\nAnd sure, there are -- at least on the surface -- some specific differences between what Clinton did and what Ivanka did. But man, in the big picture it's pretty damn similar.\n\nThe Mirijanian statement misses the point. It's stretched credulity well beyond snapping to think that Ivanka was simply blissfully unaware that what she was doing in using her private email account was totally on the up and up. No sentient being -- and certainly not one working at the top levels of government who also happens to be the eldest daughter of the President of the United States -- could have lived through the 2016 campaign and not understood this basic equation: Private emails for government business = bad.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether what Ivanka Trump did merits an official investigation -- although I strongly suspect the Democratic House will be taking a hard look come January. But what is quite clear in all of this is that Ivanka absolutely had to have known better."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "North Carolina chickenpox outbreak blamed on vaccination exemptions", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/xVVNLZXRAYA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A chickenpox outbreak among students at Asheville Waldorf School in North Carolina has grown to 36 cases as of Monday, and exemptions from vaccination were a contributing factor, according to the Buncombe County Health Department, which has been monitoring the situation since the end of October.\n\nThe school is closed for Thanksgiving break and could not be reached for comment.\n\nThough North Carolina requires vaccination for all children attending schools, the state permits both medical and religious exemptions.

Meanwhile, the school is requiring anyone who has the disease to stay home, while classmates of someone contagious (though not yet sick) must remain at home for 21 days.\n\n\"The reason for that is it can take 21 days for the time somebody is exposed to chickenpox for them to actually develop the signs and symptoms of chickenpox,\" Mullendore said. \"We don't want to have to keep those kids at home. If the child gets one dose of the chickenpox vaccine, they can return to school immediately.\"\n\nChildren whose parents provide evidence of immunity, such as blood work or a doctor's statement, can also return to school, she said.\n\nThis 21-day quarantine is \"our last resort in terms of containing and stopping the spread of the illness so that we don't see more cases and so nobody ends up with a complication,\" Mullendore said. No complications and no hospitalizations have been reported, she added.\n\n\"We can't predict who is going to end up with complications,\" she said. \"There are case reports of previously healthy children ending up in hospital because of chickenpox -- or dying because of chickenpox.\"\n\nMost parents do not hesitate to vaccinate\n\n\"The vaccine for chickenpox and all vaccines out there are safe and effective,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPew survey that found Most Americans agree that vaccines are safe for healthy children.\n\nAnother Pew Research Center survey in 2017 showed that a solid majority of Americans, 88%, believe that the benefits of vaccinating their children against measles, mumps and rubella outweigh the risks.

There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.\n\n\"I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,\" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.\n\nHow the study worked\n\nTo test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.\n\nThe treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is \"treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,\" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.\n\nEllis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nEllis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.\n\n\"We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,\" Glover said. \"You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. \"\n\nTwo-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an \"exit food challenge\": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.\n\nTwo-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.\n\nOverall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. \"It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,\" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.\n\nEllis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. \"Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,\" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.\n\nErica Gibson, a registered nurse in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, and Ellis Glover.\n\nOnce, she felt her throat constrict, and \"it was harder for me to breathe,\" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. \"I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,\" she said.\n\nA little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects.

For one, it's \"a commitment,\" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.\n\nGlover noted, \"It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner.\" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.\n\nSicherer said, \"The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy.\" It would still be worth it to many, he said.\n\nIf this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, \"that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,\" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: \"I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.\"\n\nGlover acknowledges that \"it's not a perfect solution.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: May heading to Brussels amid scramble to finalise deal", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46284310", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPA Image caption Theresa May's meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker comes ahead of this weekend's summit of EU leaders\n\nTheresa May will meet EU officials later as the two sides scramble to finalise a Brexit deal in time for Sunday's summit of European leaders.\n\nThe EU missed its deadline on Tuesday to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states.\n\nStumbling blocks remain over UK access to the EU single market, access to UK waters for EU boats and Gibraltar.\n\nThe PM is under pressure from her own MPs not to give any further ground.\n\nIt comes as the new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd appeared to rule out the option of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's my view that parliament, the House of Commons, will stop no deal.

According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food\n\nRising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity.\n\nThe UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation.\n\nThe rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds.\n\nWhat happens to the malnourished children?\n\nThe charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year.\n\n\"For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,\" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says.\n\n\"Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry.\n\n\"Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it.\"\n\nHe further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with \"a dramatic increase\" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks.\n\nOne mother's ordeal\n\nNusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children.\n\nHe was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again.\n\nImage copyright Mohammed Awadh/Save the Children Image caption 13-month-old Nusair\n\nBy that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital.\n\n\"I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,\" his mother, Suad, told the charity.\n\nIsn't Yemen already suffering from famine?\n\nNot yet - but it's getting close.\n\nJust last month, the UN warned that half the population of the war-torn country was facing \"pre-famine conditions\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues\n\nA country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine:\n\nAt least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food\n\nMore than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition\n\nAt least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day\n\nThe UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts.

Despite this, the initial transaction was not reversed.\n\nAfter reporting the call to the police, Charlotte discovered her phone line was diverted on the day of the call, explaining why the bank believed they were speaking to her at her home address.\n\n\"I just feel really angry that someone's been able to do it that easily,\" Charlotte told Watchdog.\n\n\"The bank said that the person was in the home, they did the transactions from the home and they passed all the security questions correctly - and that's why they believed that I'd done it.\"\n\nImage caption Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern and lawyer Arun Chauhan\n\nCharlotte's case pre-dates a new voluntary code of conduct on such scams which most of the banks have signed up to.\n\nIn essence, the code says that if a customer - or the bank - has failed to heed warning signs, they will be liable for any subsequent loss.\n\nUnder the code, RBS would have been obliged to pay up.\n\nThe industry is still consulting on the issue, and the code is expected to be finalised next year.\n\nFraud lawyer Arun Chauhan told the programme: \"I have a lot of sympathy for Charlotte,\n\n\"You can hear what [the caller has] tried to do is put together two transactions for the full balance of the account and the bank just don't pick it up as a warning sign.\n\n\"They know at the end this is fraud, but they've done nothing about the first transaction and that's why Charlotte should be so critical of the bank.\"\n\nAccording to fraud prevention service Cifas, facility takeover fraud - when a fraudster abuses personal data to hijack someone's existing account or services - rose 7% last year to more than 24,000 reported cases.\n\nBank accounts remain the most targeted product for fraudsters, with more than 100,000 reported cases in the UK last year.\n\nThis is how the fraud on Charlotte was carried out:\n\nBank records show the fraudster initially calls the bank, posing as Charlotte, and asks for her account to be reset for security reasons. Staff follow the bank's usual security protocol and call Charlotte's landline number, unaware the call has been diverted to a mobile phone\n\nThe security reset is processed despite the caller answering a security question incorrectly. The caller then requests that more than \u00a34,300 should be transferred to another account and the bank allows the transfer\n\nDuring the same 23-minute call, the caller requests a second transfer of a similar amount is made to a different account. This time security questions are flagged as being answered incorrectly and the transfer is denied, but the bank does not ask for the original transfer to be recalled\n\nThe bank maintained that because it had called Charlotte's home phone number to verify her identity, it was clear she was aware of the transactions. Following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police, it was discovered that the fraudster had made a call to Charlotte's landline provider to fraudulently divert the number to a mobile phone number in a different part of the UK\n\nThe FOS warned banks earlier this year that customers should not automatically be blamed for money lost through scams.\n\nIt added that fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were because of customer carelessness.\n\nThe FOS aims to resolve issues for customers relating to financial services including bank accounts, insurance, loans, credit and debit cards and investments. Last year, it was contacted by more than two million people.\n\n'Fair and reasonable'\n\nA FOS spokesperson said: \"We have made it clear to the banks that it's not fair to automatically blame a customer when they've lost money due to a scam, especially given the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems.\n\n\"When we look at complaints, we have to carefully weigh up the evidence provided by both parties to decide what we think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.\n\n\"We're pleased that Charlotte's complaint has now been resolved, and she's got her money back. If you've been the victim of a scam, and you feel your bank should have done more to help, please get in touch with us.\"\n\nAfter being contacted by Watchdog Live, an RBS spokesperson said: \"We would like to apologise to Mrs Higman that the service provided fell short of the high standards we expect.\n\n\"On review of Mrs Higman's case, and in light of new information provided to us, we have refunded Mrs Higman in full for her loss.\"\n\nYou can watch BBC Watchdog on BBC One on Wednesday at 20:00 GMT and afterwards on iPlayer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Interpol presidency vote: Russia in surprise loss to South Korea", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46286959", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:21", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Interpol Image caption Kim Jong-yang had been acting president since Meng Hongwei's disappearance\n\nInterpol has elected South Korean Kim Jong-yang as its president, rejecting the Russian frontrunner who had been accused of abusing the international police body's arrest warrant system.\n\nMr Kim was chosen by Interpol's 194 member states at a meeting of its annual congress in Dubai.\n\nHe beat Russia's Alexander Prokopchuk, who had been widely tipped to win.\n\nBut there was growing concern that Mr Prokopchuk would use the role to target critics of Russia's President Putin.\n\nMoscow hit back at what it called a \"campaign aimed at discrediting\" the Russian candidate.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian Alexander Prokopchuk was widely considered the frontrunner for the post\n\nThe election follows the disappearance of Interpol's former president Meng Hongwei, who vanished on a trip to China in September.

His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language.\n\nThe president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises.\n\nPerhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an \"enemy of the state\" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMr Trump has distilled his \"America First\" worldview down to its very essence.

Despite this, the initial transaction was not reversed.\n\nAfter reporting the call to the police, Charlotte discovered her phone line was diverted on the day of the call, explaining why the bank believed they were speaking to her at her home address.\n\n\"I just feel really angry that someone's been able to do it that easily,\" Charlotte told Watchdog.\n\n\"The bank said that the person was in the home, they did the transactions from the home and they passed all the security questions correctly - and that's why they believed that I'd done it.\"\n\nImage caption Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern and lawyer Arun Chauhan\n\nCharlotte's case pre-dates a new voluntary code of conduct on such scams which most of the banks have signed up to.\n\nIn essence, the code says that if a customer - or the bank - has failed to heed warning signs, they will be liable for any subsequent loss.\n\nUnder the code, RBS would have been obliged to pay up.\n\nThe industry is still consulting on the issue, and the code is expected to be finalised next year.\n\nFraud lawyer Arun Chauhan told the programme: \"I have a lot of sympathy for Charlotte,\n\n\"You can hear what [the caller has] tried to do is put together two transactions for the full balance of the account and the bank just don't pick it up as a warning sign.\n\n\"They know at the end this is fraud, but they've done nothing about the first transaction and that's why Charlotte should be so critical of the bank.\"\n\nAccording to fraud prevention service Cifas, facility takeover fraud - when a fraudster abuses personal data to hijack someone's existing account or services - rose 7% last year to more than 24,000 reported cases.\n\nBank accounts remain the most targeted product for fraudsters, with more than 100,000 reported cases in the UK last year.\n\nThis is how the fraud on Charlotte was carried out:\n\nBank records show the fraudster initially calls the bank, posing as Charlotte, and asks for her account to be reset for security reasons. Staff follow the bank's usual security protocol and call Charlotte's landline number, unaware the call has been diverted to a mobile phone\n\nThe security reset is processed despite the caller answering a security question incorrectly. The caller then requests that more than \u00a34,300 should be transferred to another account and the bank allows the transfer\n\nDuring the same 23-minute call, the caller requests a second transfer of a similar amount is made to a different account. This time security questions are flagged as being answered incorrectly and the transfer is denied, but the bank does not ask for the original transfer to be recalled\n\nThe bank maintained that because it had called Charlotte's home phone number to verify her identity, it was clear she was aware of the transactions. Following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police, it was discovered that the fraudster had made a call to Charlotte's landline provider to fraudulently divert the number to a mobile phone number in a different part of the UK\n\nThe FOS warned banks earlier this year that customers should not automatically be blamed for money lost through scams.\n\nIt added that fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were because of customer carelessness.\n\nThe FOS aims to resolve issues for customers relating to financial services including bank accounts, insurance, loans, credit and debit cards and investments. Last year, it was contacted by more than two million people.\n\n'Fair and reasonable'\n\nA FOS spokesperson said: \"We have made it clear to the banks that it's not fair to automatically blame a customer when they've lost money due to a scam, especially given the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems.\n\n\"When we look at complaints, we have to carefully weigh up the evidence provided by both parties to decide what we think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.\n\n\"We're pleased that Charlotte's complaint has now been resolved, and she's got her money back. If you've been the victim of a scam, and you feel your bank should have done more to help, please get in touch with us.\"\n\nAfter being contacted by Watchdog Live, an RBS spokesperson said: \"We would like to apologise to Mrs Higman that the service provided fell short of the high standards we expect.\n\n\"On review of Mrs Higman's case, and in light of new information provided to us, we have refunded Mrs Higman in full for her loss.\"\n\nYou can watch BBC Watchdog on BBC One on Wednesday at 20:00 GMT and afterwards on iPlayer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "McDonald's and Burger King criticised over adverts near schools", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46285714", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:32", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA\n\nFast food giants McDonald's and Burger King must take steps to prevent fatty, sugary or salty products being promoted near schools, a watchdog has ordered.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints about adverts for McFlurry and Whopper Jr products posted within 100m of primary schools.\n\nBillboard owner JCDecaux said it had placed the adverts there in error.\n\nMeanwhile, a decision to overturn a ban on advertising Coco Pops Granola on children's TV has angered campaigners.\n\nThe ASA had originally said that although the Kellogg's product was not high in fat, sugar or salt, the Coco the Monkey branding was synonymous with the original Coco Pops cereal, and so the ad had effectively promoted the range.\n\nHowever, the watchdog accepted it had been wrong to ban the commercial, shown during episodes of a Mr Bean cartoon, as it \"did not give greater prominence to the Coco Pops range branding generally than to the Granola product itself\".\n\nImage copyright kellogg\n\nCaroline Cerny from the Obesity Health Alliance, which lodged the original complaint, said: \"This is what happens when a large multinational food company uses its legal weight to fight rulings that influence their profits.

He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain.\n\nGibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a \"well-known tactic\" of raising issues at the last minute.

Those talks have led to a \"protocol\" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control.\n\nThere seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had \"no significant concerns over Gibraltar\", that the \"behaviour of the British government was good\" and an agreement could be reached.\n\nSo what has changed?\n\nThe Spanish government says that its \"bone of contention\" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.\n\nA senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: \"This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain.\"\n\nUnderlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a \"British colony\" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid.\n\nThough Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it.\n\nA referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British.

Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nAt least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people.\n\nHow did the charity work out the death toll?\n\nIt is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open.\n\nSave the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food\n\nRising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity.\n\nThe UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation.\n\nThe rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds.\n\nWhat happens to the malnourished children?\n\nThe charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year.\n\n\"For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,\" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says.\n\n\"Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry.\n\n\"Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it.\"\n\nHe further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with \"a dramatic increase\" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks.\n\nOne mother's ordeal\n\nNusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children.\n\nHe was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again.\n\nImage copyright Mohammed Awadh/Save the Children Image caption 13-month-old Nusair\n\nBy that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital.\n\n\"I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,\" his mother, Suad, told the charity.\n\nIsn't Yemen already suffering from famine?\n\nNot yet - but it's getting close.\n\nJust last month, the UN warned that half the population of the war-torn country was facing \"pre-famine conditions\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues\n\nA country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine:\n\nAt least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food\n\nMore than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition\n\nAt least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day\n\nThe UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts.

in the hope of finding solutions.\n\n\"Perhaps unsurprisingly, parental behaviours have received a great deal of attention,\" it says.\n\n\"Parents are widely considered to be the 'gatekeepers' to their children's food, and powerful shapers of their developing eating behaviour.\"\n\nParental feeding styles\n\nThe study notes that two types of parental feeding styles, in particular, play a role in how parents regulate children's eating habits:\n\nrestriction of food, which is thought to lead to weight gain because children overeat when the restriction is not there (the \"forbidden fruit\" effect)\n\npressure to eat, which is thought to make children with low appetites anxious, and compromise weight gain\n\nBut rather than dictate children's habits, the research suggests parents are \"responding to their child's emerging characteristics, not simply causing them\".\n\nThe researchers assessed data, from the Twins Early Development Study, of 4,500 sets of twins born in England and Wales between 1994 and 1996.\n\nThey calculated a genetic score that sets out the likelihood of these individuals to have a higher or lower body mass index (BMI).\n\nThey then matched this score against parents' feeding reports, setting out whether they used restriction or pressure.\n\nThe study found those children with a higher genetic BMI score had higher reported rates of parental restriction and those with lower BMIs had higher rates of pressuring, suggesting parents were adjusting their strategies for each child.\n\nEven within families where non-identical twins differed in their genetic predisposition, parents were more restrictive with the twin who had a tendency to be of a higher weight and were more pressuring of the twin who tended to weigh less.\n\nWhat do the results show?\n\nLead author, Saskia Selzam, from King's College London, says: \"Our findings suggest that parents develop their feeding practices in response to their child's natural tendency towards a higher or lower weight.\n\n\"The way a parent feeds their child may also influence their child's weight to some extent, but our results challenge the prevailing view that parental behaviour is the major influence on childhood weight.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSenior author, Dr Clare Llewellyn from UCL, adds: \"These results show that parents are not the 'full story' when it comes to a child's weight, and blaming parents for being too controlling about feeding may be unfair.\n\n\"But it is unclear whether these natural 'go to' strategies are helpful, harmful, or of no consequence to a child's weight in the long run.\"\n\nDo parents have any impact on weight?\n\nMs Selzam says parents clearly have an impact, but not only in establishing learnt eating behaviours.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that feeding strategies aren't important.\n\n\"But the main point is how parents influence their children's BMI genetically.\n\n\"A lot of studies suggest it must be the parents that cause the weight gain, but we are showing that it's more complex than that.\"\n\nThe researchers say further study is needed to identify which feeding strategies are acceptable and how they work.\n\nThe study is published in PLOS Genetics."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa 2020 robot rover to target Jezero 'lake' crater", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46264383", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA/JPL/JHUAPL/MSSS/BROWN UNIVERSITY Image caption Jezero Crater shows strong evidence from orbit of past water activity\n\nThe American space agency (Nasa) says it will send its 2020 Mars rover to a location known as Jezero Crater.\n\nNasa believes the rocks in this nearly 50km-wide bowl could conceivably hold a record of ancient life on the planet.\n\nSatellite images of Jezero point to river water having once cut through its rim and flowed via a delta system into a big lake.\n\nIt is the kind of environment that might just have supported microbes some 3.5-3.9 billion years ago.\n\nThis was a period when Mars was much warmer and wetter than it is today.\n\nWhat is so special about Jezero?\n\nEvidence for the past presence of a lake is obviously a draw, but Ken Farley, the Nasa project scientist on the mission, said the delta traces were also a major attraction.\n\n\"A delta is extremely good at preserving bio-signatures - any evidence of life that might have existed in the lake water, or at the interface of the sediment and the lake water, or possibly things that lived in the headwaters region that were swept in by the river and deposited in the delta,\" he told reporters.\n\nJezero's multiple rock types, including clays and carbonates, have high potential to preserve the organic molecules that would hint at life's bygone existence.\n\nThe 500m-deep crater was chosen after a four-year consultation process with Mars scientists. In a straw-poll taken at the end of the most recent site-selection workshop, it came out the clear favourite. Nasa's administration has now endorsed the choice.\n\nJezero is sited just north of Mars' equator. It is named after a town in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In some Slavic languages the word \"jezero\" also means \"lake\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Mars 2020 rover is based on the design of the Curiosity robot\n\nHow does 2020 link to future missions?\n\nAnother of the robot's key objectives will be to select and \"cache\" in small canisters some rock samples that could, at a later date, be collected and returned to Earth labs for analysis.\n\nNasa is working with the European Space Agency (Esa) on this initiative, but exactly when the sample tubes might come home is uncertain.\n\nPlanning with Esa was at an early stage, said Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's science chief. \"Depending on how the details come out, it could be in the early 2030s,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The 2020 mission will again use a \"Skycrane\" to put the rover on the surface\n\nIs the 2020 rover a copy of Curiosity?\n\nThe 2020 rover is based on the one-tonne Curiosity robot that the agency landed in Gale Crater in 2012. Curiosity has been a great success, and Nasa wants to repeat it. Using the same \"template\" also saves money; some equipment spares were left over from 2012.\n\nThat said, instrument-wise, the new vehicle is quite a bit different. Yes, it will again feature cameras, a robotic arm, a drill and a laser - but there is a new suite of sensors and analysis tools, and there is even an experiment to demonstrate how future astronauts might make oxygen on the Red Planet.\n\nThe new robot will use the same \"Skycrane\" technology that put Curiosity down with such great precision six years ago - but with an add-on. Engineers have developed an on-the-fly mapping system called Terrain-Relative Navigation which ought to bring even greater accuracy to the landing process.\n\nWhat else can we look forward to on Mars?\n\nMissions to Mars can only launch inside a tight time window due to the alignment of the planets.\n\nThe 2020 venture will leave Earth in the July/August of that year and should land on 18 February 2021.\n\n\"Nasa has a long and successful track record at Mars. Since Mariner 4 flew by Mars in 1965, we've orbited, we've landed and we've roved across the surface of the Red Planet,\" said Lori Glaze, the acting director of Nasa's planetary science division. \"And we've got another opportunity to improve our track record a week from today when we land InSight on the surface. We're all looking forward to that.\"\n\nUnlike 2020 and Curiosity, Insight is a static lander. It will be the first mission dedicated to \"looking inside\" the planet. It will use seismometers to listen for \"Marsquakes\", to help build a picture of Mars' internal structure.\n\nEsa is sending a rover to Mars in 2020 also. European scientists recently selected Oxia Planum as its destination. Satellite imagery suggests, as with Jezero and Gale, this ancient terrain came into prolonged contact with water.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "The physicist called Einstein - but not the one you think", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46261009", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nBBC 100 Women is celebrating talented women from history whose work has been overshadowed by their male relatives.

A literature professor at Columbia University and celebrated intellectual, \"he was a scholar and an ordinary man's person,\" according to the Independent's Middle East correspondent, Robert Fisk.\n\nA fatal diagnosis with leukaemia in 1991 prompted him to start working on Out of Place: A Memoir, a coming-of-age story of exile and a celebration of his irrecoverable past. In this masterpiece, Said rediscovers the lost Arab world of his early years in Palestine, as well as in Lebanon and Egypt.\n\nRaised as a Protestant in a predominately Eastern Orthodox community in Jerusalem, he realised early in life that he had something of a split identity. His first name was British, his last name Arabic and he carried an American passport through his father's US army service in the first world war.\n\nDescribing her English faculty colleague's seminal work, Gauri Viswanathan says, \"He saw being out of place as a psychological state of things \u2026 as a physical characterisation. He saw out of place as also a moving reflection on being out of place - the place being Palestine.\"\n\nWhile living and working in pro-Israeli New York City, the 1967 Arab-Israeli War marked a defining point in his life. The war changed the map of the Middle East and has affected the path to Arab-Israeli peace until today because of the way it redrew borders, implemented Israel's territorial claims and confirmed its military dominance in the region.\n\n\"I was no longer the same person after 1967\", wrote Said. \"The shock of that war drove me back to where it had all started, the struggle over Palestine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Columbia University, Said's preoccupation with the Arab world began to show in his published work, as he produced one of the most significant books of the 20th century. Orientalism challenged western preconceptions about the 'other', arguing it saw it as exotic, backward, uncivilised and sometimes dangerous. The book effectively gave birth to the academic discipline of post-colonial studies.\n\nSaid became something of a superstar in some academic circles and began trying to change the stereotype of Palestine and the Palestinians among Americans - and was also elected to the Palestine National Council, the governing body of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). But he predictably fell foul of the US pro-Israel lobby and a far-right Jewish magazine labelled him the 'professor of terror'.\n\nSaid was an accomplished musician and pianist and as his health failed in the late 1990s, he took a step away from politics and devoted the last years of his life to music, seeing it as a universal language. He wanted to break down barriers and find a common language between Israelis and Arabs - and so co-founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra with Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim.\n\nThis disappointed some of his peers who were quick to point out that this meant what they saw as normalisation with a coloniser. \"I reminded him that he taught us not to separate art and music from politics,\" says Lebanese writer Samah Idriss.\n\nColumbia University Professor Hamid Dabashi captures the essence and impact of his friend and colleague: \"With the death of Edward Said we immigrant intellectuals ceased to be immigrant and became native to a new organicity. We are the fulfilments of his battles. He theorised himself to be out of place so timely and so punctiliously, so that after him we are no longer out of place, at home where ever we can hang our hat and say no to power \u2026\n\n\"We are all free-floating. Said was very site specific about Palestine - and thereby he made the Palestinian predicament a metaphysical allegory, and he grounded it in the physical agony and heroism of his people\u2026 The new intellectual organicity that Said enabled requires that you roll up your sleeves, get down and dirty, so that in the midst of chaos you can seek solace, of darkness, light, of despair, hope.\"\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Interpol elects South Korea's Kim Jong Yang as president", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/interpol-elects-south-korea-kim-jong-yang-president-181121074348523.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Interpol has elected Kim Jong Yang of South Korea as its next president, according to the international police body.\n\nKim, who had been serving as acting president, was elected for a two-year term at the body's annual congress in Dubai on Wednesday, finishing the four-year term of his predecessor who was arrested in China this year.\n\n#BREAKING: Kim Jong Yang of the Republic of #Korea has been elected President of INTERPOL (2-yr term). #INTERPOLGA pic.twitter.com/6I9HIyUWrf \u2014 INTERPOL (@INTERPOL_HQ) November 21, 2018\n\nThe South Korean's election is a blow to Moscow's efforts to reserve the position for a Russian candidate, Alexander Prokopchuk.\n\nThe US, Britain and other European nations have said Prokopchuk's election would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol's red notice system to go after political opponents and fugitive dissidents.\n\nIn turn, the Kremlin said on Tuesday that the US lobbying against Prokopchuk, a former major general in Russia's interior ministry, amounted to election meddling.\n\nInterpol is best known for issuing \"red notices\" that identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world's \"most-wanted\" list.\n\nWilliam Browder, a British fund manager critical of the Kremlin who has been detained repeatedly at Russia's behest before being released again, told BBC radio in London: \"[Prokopchuk] has been responsible for trying to chase me down and have Interpol arrest me seven times.\"\n\nKim's predecessor\n\nThe election of Kim comes after former Interpol chief Meng Hongwei resigned after he was detained in China in September on bribery and corruption charges.\n\nMeng disappeared in China for 13 days before his arrest was made public in October.\n\nChina's Ministry of Public Security said that Meng's suspected corruption and violation of laws \"gravely jeopardised\" the ruling party and the police, according to a report in the South China Morning Post.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nAuthorities also said Meng was in this situation due to his own \"willfulness and for bringing trouble upon himself\".\n\nFrance, which hosts Interpol's headquaters in Lyon, received Meng's resignation as president of Interpol with immediate effect.\n\nMeng's wife, Grace, said her husband sent her an image of a knife before he disappeared during a trip to their native China.\n\nMaking her first public comments on the issue, Grace Meng told reporters in Lyon that she thought the knife was her husband's way of trying to tell her he was in danger.\n\nShe said she has had no further contact with him since the message that was sent on September 25.

And Hungary's an extreme of the predicament the whole world is going through. Gaspar Tamas, philosopher and political scientist\n\nThe Highwaymen are affiliated with the country's far-right political movement, Force and Determination, and believe in racially-justified violence. They went to 'help' the military forces at the country's southern borders when migrants passed through Hungary on the Balkan route in 2015. And some of their members are currently on trial for intimidating Roma.\n\n\"We never prepare for a fight, we are ready for a fight,\" says Adam, a 27-year-old who joined the Highwaymen in 2016. \"I like being a member of the Highwaymen's Army because it means togetherness ... In order to apply, you obviously have to be Hungarian, and white. Jews should avoid us. They're not only not allowed to join, but if he asked to join the Highwaymen's Army I would smack him in the face.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Bulscu Hunyadi believes that \"most of these youngsters do not join far-right organisations because they are obsessed with the ideology, because they are neo-Nazis per se. Most of the time they join these organisations because they want to join a community, they want to belong to a group of people. And step by step, of course, they start believing in this ideology.\"\n\nBotond, an 18-year-old high school graduate with ambitions to forge a career in Hungary's far-right politics, is still looking for a movement to join and is determined to defend Hungary against liberalism and multiculturalism.\n\n\"I feel like I have to fight, fight for my country ... There is a war against the white race. Nowadays, you can say whatever you want except if you are heterosexual, if you are white and if you are a Christian,\" says Botond, who goes on regular vigilante patrols in the city in search of what he calls \"degenerates\".\n\nHowever, this perceived threat is a \"myth ... because nobody is threatening Hungary, we don't have immigrants at all, zero immigration, but this is the one political topic everybody's discussing,\" explains Gaspar Tamas, a philosopher and political scientist.\n\n\"If you want to learn what the world might look like very soon, regard Hungary. And Hungary's an extreme of the predicament the whole world is going through.\"\n\nInside Hungary's far right\n\nBy Theopi Skarlatos, filmmaker\n\nIt seems that these days, every other month another country elects a far-right leader. Hate speech, anti-Semitic rhetoric and xenophobia have become the norm in the upper echelons of power and governments across the world seem to be normalising and legitimising the behaviour of the far right.\n\nSo it's no surprise that members of those far-right groups feel justified in their beliefs and bolder in the way they voice their opinion.\n\nWhen we met Adam, he was perfectly respectful and gentlemanly towards us as a film crew, but at the same time, he would openly talk about his hatred of Jews and his wishes to criminalise interracial couples.\n\nAlthough horrified by the opinions of the young people we filmed, in many ways I was comforted in my final thoughts following the filming. I felt like their opinions could still change. Theopi Skarlatos, filmmaker\n\nBy spending time with him and the Highwaymen's Army, one of the most dangerous far-right groups in Hungary, I was hoping to find out more about his character and his motives to join such a movement.\n\nHow can someone harbour so much hate towards one group of people that they wish to completely rid them of all social and legal rights? How could someone have such a lack of compassion for refugees fleeing the horrors of war that they congratulated police officers who'd violently attacked them?\n\nWe set about spending time with Adam as well as 18-year-old Botond, a smart student who \"loves his country\" and \"just wants to do good for it\". Botond says he turned to far-right groups because, in a world brimming with fake news, he \"did not know where to find the truth\" - which is unsurprising considering almost all Hungarian media are now controlled by government-friendly businessmen.\n\nI was astounded by how much anger Adam carried from his childhood - how visibly upset he became when recounting the consequences of the fall of communism and the dashed hopes of his parents when they were forced to sell their family home during the financial crisis that followed.\n\n\"It's clear I would go down this path,\" he said. \"There is an immeasurable anger inside me.\"\n\nRather than making a film about my own judgement of these young right-wingers, I wanted to let them explain themselves and share their stories - but without giving the far right a platform to merely spout hate.\n\nAlthough horrified by the opinions of the young people we filmed, in many ways I was comforted in my final thoughts following the filming.\n\nI felt like their opinions could still change.\n\n'Fascism never really went away'\n\nThe reality is, the world currently is reminiscent of the 1930s, a decade that led to years of war, devastation and excruciating pain. We have never since been as polarised, until now. But we don't have to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nBy creating an atmosphere where Hungarians feel they must constantly defend against an invisible evil, Orban is creating a world that is ripe for the return of fascism. Theopi Skarlatos, filmmaker\n\nThere is still time, although philosopher Gaspar Tamas believes we are \"past the danger\". According to him, this is a \"quiet walk to the precipice\" without the \"fanfare of old fascism\".

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

U.S. officials said the move is intended to prevent a spike in oil prices.\n\n\"We've been working very well with China and India, who have dramatically reduced their imports of Iranian oil,\" Hook said. \"It's very important to go after the money, and for Iran, that means going after the oil revenue.\"\n\nIn a sign of ongoing defiance toward the U.S. sanctions campaign, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Monday his government will \"not yield to economic and psychological pressure.\"\n\nIran's state-run Press TV network said Rouhani was speaking to a large gathering in the northwestern city of Khoy.\n\n\"We know you're angry!

Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the likely incoming chairman of the Oversight panel, said Tuesday that he will resume that bipartisan investigation, which was dropped by Republicans. And he will pressure President Donald Trump's administration to turn over records about the use of private email for public business by Ivanka Trump, Kushner and other senior officials.\n\n\"My goal is to prevent this from happening again \u2014 not to turn this into a spectacle the way Republicans went after Hillary Clinton,\" Cummings said. \"My main priority as Chairman will be to focus on the issues that impact Americans in their everyday lives.\"\n\nThe issue resurfaced this week when The Washington Post reported that the president's daughter, while a top White House adviser, sent hundreds of emails about government business from a personal email account last year. The emails were sent to White House aides, Cabinet members and Ivanka Trump's assistants, many in violation of public records rules, according to the Post.\n\nIn comments to reporters, the president, who has spent years railing against Clinton's use of private email for public business while secretary of state, sought to downplay \u2014 and differentiate \u2014 his daughter's email use from his former opponent's.\n\n\"They aren't classified like Hillary Clinton.

Jason Chaffetz. After Chaffetz retired from Congress, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina joined with Cummings in demanding that the White House provide the identities of staff members who had used their personal emails to conduct official business.\n\nIn October 2017, the White House dispatched counsel's office lawyers Stefan Passantino, Uttam Dhillon and Daniel Epstein to brief bipartisan committee staff, but the attorneys refused to identify any officials who had used private email for official business. The lawyers only said that several White House employees had \"confessed\" to failing to following the Presidential Records Act, according to a letter summarizing the briefing released by Cummings earlier this year.\n\nThe White House lawyers said they couldn't provide additional information on specific employees while an internal review was under way, according to the letter.\n\nBut the White House lawyers said they would share the findings of the internal review with the committee once it concluded, according to a separate letter sent to the White House by Gowdy.\n\nCummings has said the committee never received that information, and Democrats have said Gowdy dropped the issue and never followed up.\n\nThe discovery of the extent of Ivanka Trump's email use was prompted by public records requests from the liberal watchdog group American Oversight.

Meanwhile, only 4 of 31 wild birds in a forest in the western town of Maricao survived, along with 75 out of 134 wild parrots living in the Rio Abajo forest in the central mountains of Puerto Rico, scientists said.\n\nAnd while several dozen new parrots have been born in captivity and in the wild since Maria, the species is still in danger, according to scientists.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Gustavo Olivieri, parrot recovery program coordinator for Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources.\n\nFederal and local scientists will meet next month to debate how best to revive a species that numbered more than 1 million in the 1800s but dwindled to 13 birds during the 1970s after decades of forest clearing.\n\nThe U.S. and Puerto Rican governments launched a program in 1972 that eventually led to the creation of three breeding centers. Just weeks before Maria hit, scientists reported 56 wild birds at El Yunque, the highest since the program was launched.\n\nBut the population decline is now especially worrisome because the parrots that vanished from El Yunque were some of the last remaining wild ones, said Marisel Lopez, who oversees the parrot recovery program at El Yunque for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\n\"It was devastating.

A third breeding center in a forest in the western rural town of Maricao has not operated since the storm. Scientists are now trying to determine the best way to prepare the parrots for release since there are such few birds in the wild they can interact with, and whether Puerto Rico's damaged forests can sustain them.\n\nOne proposal scientists will consider is whether to capture some of the remaining wild parrots in the Rio Abajo forest and place them in the same cage as birds that will be released to the wild, so they can learn to emulate their social behavior to ensure their survival, said Jafet Velez, a wildlife biologist with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.\n\nScientists are tentatively planning to release 20 birds next year in Rio Abajo.\n\nAnother proposal is to release more parrots in Maricao, which was not as heavily damaged by Maria.\n\n\"Our priority now is not reproduction. ... it's to start releasing them,\" Lopez said, adding that breeding centers can hold only so many parrots.\n\nBut first, scientists need to make sure the forests can offer food and safe shelter.\n\nJessica Ilse, a forest biologist at el Yunque for the U.S. Forest Service, said scientists are collecting data about the amount of fruit falling from trees and the number of leaves shed. She said the canopy still has not grown back since Maria and warned that invasive species have taken root since more sunlight now shines through.

It will be the first American spacecraft to land since the Curiosity rover in 2012 and the first dedicated to exploring underground.\n\nNASA is going with a tried-and-true method to get this mechanical miner to the surface of the red planet. Engine firings will slow its final descent and the spacecraft will plop down on its rigid legs, mimicking the landings of earlier successful missions.\n\nThat's where old school ends on this $1 billion U.S.-European effort.\n\nOnce flight controllers in California determine the coast is clear at the landing site \u2014 fairly flat and rock free \u2014 InSight's 6-foot (1.8-meter) arm will remove the two main science experiments from the lander's deck and place them directly on the Martian surface.\n\nNo spacecraft has attempted anything like that before.\n\nThe firsts don't stop there.\n\nOne experiment will attempt to penetrate 16 feet (5 meters) into Mars, using a self-hammering nail with heat sensors to gauge the planet's internal temperature. That would shatter the out-of-this-world depth record of 8 feet (2 { meters) drilled by the Apollo moonwalkers nearly a half-century ago for lunar heat measurements.\n\nThe astronauts also left behind instruments to measure moonquakes. InSight carries the first seismometers to monitor for marsquakes \u2014 if they exist. Yet another experiment will calculate Mars' wobble, providing clues about the planet's core.\n\nIt won't be looking for signs of life, past or present. No life detectors are on board.\n\nThe spacecraft is like a self-sufficient robot, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n\"It's got its own brain. It's got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun,\" he said.\n\nBy scoping out the insides of Mars, scientists could learn how our neighbor \u2014 and other rocky worlds, including the Earth and moon \u2014 formed and transformed over billions of years. Mars is much less geologically active than Earth, and so its interior is closer to being in its original state \u2014 a tantalizing time capsule.\n\nInSight stands to \"revolutionize the way we think about the inside of the planet,\" said NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen.\n\nBut first, the 800-pound (360-kilogram) vehicle needs to get safely to the Martian surface. This time, there won't be a ball bouncing down with the spacecraft tucked inside, like there were for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004. And there won't be a sky crane to lower the lander like there was for the six-wheeled Curiosity during its dramatic \"seven minutes of terror.\"\n\n\"That was crazy,\" acknowledged InSight's project manager, Tom Hoffman. But he noted, \"Any time you're trying to land on Mars, it's crazy, frankly. I don't think there's a sane way to do it.\"\n\nNo matter how it's done, getting to Mars and landing there is hard \u2014 and unforgiving.\n\nEarth's success rate at Mars is a mere 40 percent. That includes planetary flybys dating back to the early 1960s, as well as orbiters and landers.\n\nWhile it's had its share of flops, the U.S. has by far the best track record. No one else has managed to land and operate a spacecraft on Mars. Two years ago, a European lander came in so fast, its descent system askew, that it carved out a crater on impact.\n\nThis time, NASA is borrowing a page from the 1976 twin Vikings and the 2008 Phoenix, which also were stationary and three-legged.\n\n\"But you never know what Mars is going to do,\" Hoffman said. \"Just because we've done it before doesn't mean we're not nervous and excited about doing it again.\"\n\nWind gusts could send the spacecraft into a dangerous tumble during descent, or the parachute could get tangled. A dust storm like the one that enveloped Mars this past summer could hamper InSight's ability to generate solar power. A leg could buckle. The arm could jam.\n\nThe tensest time for flight controllers in Pasadena, California: the six minutes from the time the spacecraft hits Mars' atmosphere and touchdown. They'll have jars of peanuts on hand \u2014 a good-luck tradition dating back to 1964's successful Ranger 7 moon mission.\n\nInSight will enter Mars' atmosphere at a supersonic 12,300 mph (19,800 kph), relying on its white nylon parachute and a series of engine firings to slow down enough for a soft upright landing on Mars' Elysium Planitia, a sizable equatorial plain.\n\nHoffman hopes it's \"like a Walmart parking lot in Kansas.\"\n\nThe flatter the better so the lander doesn't tip over, ending the mission, and so the robotic arm can set the science instruments down.\n\nInSight \u2014 short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport \u2014 will rest close to the ground, its top deck barely a yard, or meter, above the surface. Once its twin circular solar panels open, the lander will occupy the space of a large car.\n\nIf NASA gets lucky, a pair of briefcase-size satellites trailing InSight since their joint May liftoff could provide near-live updates during the lander's descent. There's an eight-minute lag in communications between Earth and Mars.\n\nThe experimental CubeSats, dubbed WALL-E and EVE from the 2008 animated movie, will zoom past Mars and remain in perpetual orbit around the sun, their technology demonstration complete.\n\nIf WALL-E and EVE are mute, landing news will come from NASA orbiters at Mars, just not as quickly.\n\nThe first pictures of the landing site should start flowing shortly after touchdown. It will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed. Add another several weeks for the heat probe to bury into Mars.\n\nThe mission is designed to last one full Martian year, the equivalent of two Earth years.\n\nWith landing day so close to Thanksgiving, many of the flight controllers will be eating turkey at their desks on the holiday.\n\nHoffman expects his team will wait until Monday to give full and proper thanks."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Healthy Children Who Aren't Growing, May Not Make Enough Human Growth Hormone", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/health-growth-hormone/4666013.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Most healthy children between the ages of four and 10 grow about five centimeters (two inches) a year.

Spencer was the shortest player on his team. It didn't stop him from playing, but the height difference was noticeable. And it made Spencer feel different.\n\n\"I want to be as tall as these kids,\u201d Spencer said.\n\nAt first, Spencer's parents thought their son was just small, but gradually, they suspected something was wrong.

And they never should have fit. Those were from the spring prior,\u201d Baehman said.\n\nSpencer's parents set up an appointment with Dr. Bert Bachrach, the chief of pediatric endocrinology at University of Missouri Health Care. Nurses measured Spencer's height.\n\nAfter careful testing, Dr. Bachrach determined a growth hormone deficiency was causing Spencer's growth failure. Hormones are basically chemicals that send messages from one cell to another.\n\n\"Growth hormone just doesn't affect your growth, it affects your muscle mass and fat distribution, so that affects your cholesterol, that affects you overall, it also affects your overall sense of wellbeing,\u201d Bachrach said.\n\nGrowth hormone insufficiency is a disorder involving the pituitary gland which is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. It's this gland that produces human growth hormone, among others.\n\nEvery day, Spencer's mother gives him a daily hormone injection. Since he started getting these injections two years ago, Spencer has grown about 15 centimeters (six inches).

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\u201cHer brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \u201cAnd unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years: fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg\u2019s \u2014 troubles.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \u201caggressive lobbying campaign\u201d against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Sandberg or make her available for an interview. A representative instead pointed to Zuckerberg's remarks that overall, \u201cSheryl is doing great work for the company. She's been a very important partner to me and continues to be, and will continue to be. She's leading a lot of the efforts to improve our systems in these areas.\u201d\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \u201cheat shield\u201d for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \u201cLean In\u201d about women and leadership. Her second book, \u201cPlan B,\u201d is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\u201cIt's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\u201d crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \u201cShe has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with \u2018Lean In.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\u201cEvery day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \u201cpublic fallout\u201d over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \u201cface inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \u201cadult\u201d in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away. But Levick believes she can begin to restore her image by acknowledging her role in causing Facebook's problems instead of blaming external forces beyond her control: \u201cThe knee jerk response \u2018poor, poor\u2019 me\u2019 is not the solution.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Where Did North Korea\u2019s Cyber Army Come From?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-cyber-army/4666459.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "North Korean hackers continue to circumvent protections and compromise computer systems around the globe. Pyongyang\u2019s cyber operatives, like the Lazarus Group, have been linked to computer system infiltrations like the 2014 Sony Pictures Studios hack prior to the release of the U.S. film \u201cThe Interview\u201d and the attempted theft of close to $1 billion from the central Bangladesh bank using the SWIFT banking network in 2016.\n\nBut how did Pyongyang become so adept at hacking while not possessing rich resources and being under tough International sanctions?\n\nSeungjoo Kim, a professor at Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of Information Security says the answer, in part, is because North Korea\u2019s computer hackers operate in China and Europe with easy access to the internet.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea practices their craft under real conditions, like hacking cryptocurrency sites or stealing information,\u201d he said, \u201cThese repeated exercises help to improve their skills.\u201d\n\nAs an instructor, Seungjoo Kim teaches his students how hackers invade other systems using traditional textbooks instruction. But without real-world trials, he says they can\u2019t obtain the knowledge needed to test systems or prevent hostile attacks.\n\n\u201cBasically, you should teach basic computer knowledge, and then try to solve some hacking problems,\u201d he said, adding that the best way to improve one\u2019s computer infiltration skills is with real-time and real-world practice.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea acquires [their] knowledge by invading other systems,\u201d said Kim.\n\nHe added that because North Korea can directly attack other countries, that effort has enabled Pyongyang to quickly develop their world-renowned hacking skills.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s cyber army\n\nExperts assert there are between 6,000 and 7,500 members of North Korea\u2019s cyber army, split into a number of divisions to carry out cyberterrorism against state infrastructure, financial institutions, and the latest hijacking of defense technology.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea was inspired by the Chinese cyberwar units and learned from them,\u201d said NK Intellectuals Solidarity director Heung Kwan Kim, \u201cRecognizing their power, North Korea set up the first unit within the central government in 1993.\u201d\n\nWhile Pyongyang\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau is comprised of six divisions and overseas operations in South Korea, the United States, and Japan, it\u2019s another bureau that is responsible for the bulk of North Korea\u2019s cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cUnit 121 oversees Unit 180, Unit 91, and lab 110,\u201d Heung Kwan Kim told VOA.\n\nA 500-person strong Unit 121 was created in 1998, and in 2009 the group successfully carried out 77 attacks by overwhelming computer networks through unleashing an onslaught of Internet traffic.\n\nThis led Pyongyang to conclude that cyber-warfare was \u201cthe most suitable form of war\u201d for North Korea in the modern era, according to Heung Kwan Kim.\n\nAttacks continued throughout 2014, and in 2015. When North Korea reorganized their divisions, Unit 121 was given the mission of attacking a foreign nation\u2019s infrastructure, such as transportation networks, telecommunications, gas, electric power, nuclear power, and aviation systems.\n\nUnit 91\u2019s focus was shifted to acquiring \u201cadvanced technologies needed for nuclear development and long-range missiles from developed countries.\u201d\n\nFinally, the role of Unit 180 was changed for it to target financial systems and to focus on block chain technology.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchains\n\nWith international sanctions crippling Pyongyang\u2019s coffers, Heung Kwan Kim said North Korea shifted their cyberattacks to private systems, rather than government networks, because the smaller entities weren\u2019t as well protected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of North Korea\u2019s high ability and low security,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numerous attacks on small and private companies have led to allegations that Pyongyang is hacking into cryptocurrency exchanges to steal virtual money, like Bitcoin, said Seungjoo Kim. Stolen cryptocurrencies are attractive because they are difficult to trace back to their original owner.\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus was accused of attacking South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb. The cyber thieves made off with nearly $7 million in digital currencies.\n\nThe hackers also obtained personal information of users stored on the compromised servers. The BBC reports North Korea was later able to ransom additional funds from the owners in exchange for deleting the data.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is easy to steal because it moves in cyberspace,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo earn cryptocurrency in a legitimate way, cutting-edge computers are required, but North Korea doesn\u2019t have them, so they attack computers abroad and hack mining programs.\u201d\n\nThe hacked computers then send any virtual coins it uncovers to North Korean digital wallets they can convert to hard currency.\n\nTo curtail North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks, he advocates a detente in the virtual world that\u2019s similar to the easing of tensions taking place on the peninsula. However, that may be difficult, as it would require Pyongyang to admit it committed acts of cyberwarfare.\n\nIn addition, it would require \u201cRussia and China not only participating in current real-world sanctions, cyber sanctions at the same time,\u201d said Seungjoo Kim.\n\nThe last component, he said, would be for governments to codify what measures would be employed as proportional responses, should additional cyberattacks take place and prepare for those events."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Where Did North Korea\u2019s Cyber Army Come From?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-cyber-army/4666395.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "North Korean hackers continue to circumvent protections to compromise computer systems around the globe.

They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some members of the Saudi royal family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cvery premature\u201d but \u201cpossible,\u201d and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \u201cnothing else to add at this time\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \u201cfocus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\u201d and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. ROLE KEY\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \u201cwould not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\u201d because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\u201cThey (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \u201croll some heads to appease the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2013 including one of MbS\u2019s closest aides.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi King Salman expressed support for his son, the crown prince, who is accused or orchestrating the slaying.\n\nALLEGIANCE COUNCIL\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Protesters Opposing Migrant Caravan Clash With Police In Tijuana", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesters-migrant-caravan-tijuana_us_5bf28209e4b075738820085b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Residents of the Mexican border city of Tijuana protested the arrival of thousands of Central American migrants, who are hoping to seek shelter while they await an opportunity to enter the United States.\n\nMexican police in riot gear faced off against the group of protesters, estimated in the hundreds, outside of a sports complex that was turned into a makeshift migrant shelter on Sunday.

In a fiery opinion issued Tuesday, Judge Carlton W. Reeves said the statute, described as one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, \u201cunequivocally\u201d violated women\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nReeves wrote of his \u201cfrustration\u201d that state lawmakers had chosen to pass the law despite the fact that similar legislation has been thrown out by federal courts in other states and that such litigation is very costly for taxpayers.\n\nHe contended the \u201creal reason\u201d for the ban\u2019s passage appeared to be the state\u2019s politically driven desire to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 law that assures a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access safe and legal abortions.\n\n\u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Reeves wrote. \u201cThis court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.\u201d\n\nThe law, which banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy except in cases of medical emergency or \u201csevere fetal abnormality,\u201d was passed in March. Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, filed a lawsuit challenging the ban on the same day, and Reeves put a temporary restraining order on the law the following morning.\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, states cannot restrict abortions before a fetus is considered viable. According to established medical consensus, viability typically begins at 23 to 24 weeks, Reeves noted in his opinion this week.\n\nThe judge acknowledged, however, that, \u201cwith the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court\u201d \u2015 an apparent reference to the additions of conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2015 the future of the nation\u2019s abortion laws has been cast into doubt.\n\n\u201cTime will tell.

The Supreme Court had rejected a very similar request to temporarily stop the litigation just weeks ago, the judge noted.\n\nThe judge, who sits in the Southern District of New York, did not hold back his frustration in his 7-page opinion, noting that the Department of Justice had submitted 12 separate requests to delay the proceedings since the Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cUnless burdening Plaintiffs and the federal courts with make-work is a feature of Defendants\u2019 litigation strategy, as opposed to a bug, it is hard to see the point,\u201d Furman wrote.\n\nAll along, the judge has expressed a desire to move the case along quickly, recognizing that any decision he makes is likely to be appealed to higher courts and that the issue needs to be resolved quickly so that the Census Bureau has time to print the census forms.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Furman wrote in his Tuesday ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit \u2015 brought by 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups \u2015 argues that the decision to add the citizenship question was motivated by discriminatory intent. They also say the decision should be set aside on the grounds that it was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nIn this latest effort to stall the proceedings, the Justice Department said that doing so would help conserve judicial resources, an argument the judge dismissed as \u201cgalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Defendants were truly interested in conserving judicial resources, they could have avoided burdening this Court, the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court with twelve stay applications over the last eleven weeks that, with one narrow exception, have been repeatedly rejected as meritless,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cInstead, Defendants would have focused their attention on the ultimate issues in this case, where the attention of the parties and the Court now belongs.\u201d\n\nKelly Laco, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on Furman\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed this latest motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit even before Furman had ruled on it \u2015 a highly unusual move that clearly annoyed the judge, who suggested the department\u2019s conduct in the case was sanctionable.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 motion makes so little sense, even on its own terms, that it is hard to understand as anything but an attempt to avoid a timely decision on the merits altogether,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThat conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Defendants, once again, appealed to the Second Circuit even before this Court had heard from Plaintiffs, let alone issued this ruling on the motion.\u201d\n\nFurman also noted that the 2nd Circuit had already denied that appeal as \u201cpremature.\u201d\n\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who is leading the case for the plaintiffs, praised Furman\u2019s decision."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Responds To 'Basic Civics' Jab From Sarah Palin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-palin-alexandria-ocasio-cortez_us_5bf47a3ae4b03b230f9c45e0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "She\u2019s not been sworn into office yet, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is already proving capable at rebuffing attacks \u2015 this time from a former GOP standard-bearer.\n\nFormer vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeted a jab at the incoming Democratic congresswoman from New York on Thursday, calling out Ocasio-Cortez for misspeaking in an interview and referring to the three branches of government as the \u201cthree chambers of Congress,\u201d then the \u201cthree chambers of government,\u201d which Ocasio-Cortez called \u201cthe presidency, the Senate and the House.\u201d\n\nYIKES: Ocasio-Cortez Fumbles Basic Civics TWICE In 1 Statement https://t.co/5xkWeYjsPP \u2014 Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) November 19, 2018\n\nOcasio-Cortez, meanwhile, issued her own tongue-in-cheek response.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s *TWO* fallen GOP Vice Pres candidates going after a freshman Congresswoman that\u2019s not even sworn in yet,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little early to be bringing out the big guns?

The school has one of the highest recorded rates of religious exemptions to vaccines in the state.\n\nThe school is asking kids diagnosed with the disease to stay at home. Since it can take 21 days for children exposed to chickenpox to show symptoms, classmates of contagious students are also being asked to stay home too, CNN reports.\n\nChildren who have gotten at least one dose of the chickenpox vaccine will be allowed to return, according to Dr. Jennifer Mullendore, the Buncombe County medical director. Kids whose parents can provide proof of immunity through bloodwork or a doctor\u2019s statement will also be allowed to go back to school, she said.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine for chickenpox and all vaccines out there are safe and effective,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nNorth Carolina law requires every child in the state to be immunized against certain diseases. Children are required to get two doses of the vaccine for chickenpox before entering kindergarten. But parents can claim religious or medical exemptions to the law.\n\nFor religious exemptions, parents or guardians simply need to write a statement describing their \u201cbona fide\u201d religious objections to the immunization requirements. The statement may be given to schools and day cares in place of an immunization record. The statements don\u2019t need to be notarized, signed by a religious leader, prepared by a lawyer or submitted to the state for review.\n\nThe Asheville Waldorf School is part of an international network of schools that use the Waldorf method, a teaching philosophy that focuses on creative learning and individual development. Generally, Waldorf schools are not affiliated with any church and don\u2019t espouse a particular religious doctrine.\n\nBut at the Asheville Waldorf School, which serves children from nursery school to sixth grade, a significant number of parents have expressed religious objections to vaccinations. Nearly 68 percent of the school\u2019s kindergarten class claimed religious exemption to immunizations last year, according to data from North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOf the school\u2019s 152 students, 110 have not gotten the chickenpox vaccine, according to the Citizen Times.\n\nThe school, which is incorporated as the Azalea Mountain School, has not responded to a request for comment. The school said in a statement on its website that it follows the state\u2019s immunizations requirements \u201cstrictly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also recognize that a parent\u2019s decision to immunize their children happens before they enter school,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nOverall, 5.7 percent of kindergartners in Buncombe County claimed religious exemptions to vaccines \u2015 a higher rate than for any other county in the state.\n\nMixmike via Getty Images A vaccine for the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, was introduced in the U.S. in 1995.\n\nChickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes a blisterlike rash, itching, tiredness and fever. The virus used to be very common in the U.S., affecting about 4 million people in the early 1990s and causing up to 150 deaths each year. But a vaccine for the disease, which was made available in 1995, has proved very effective in preventing hospitalization and deaths from chickenpox, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC has found that two doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox.\n\nMullendore told the Citizen Times that even though some parents may not think chickenpox is a serious disease, the outbreak at Asheville Waldorf should be taken seriously. Two to three out of every 1,000 children infected with the virus require hospitalization, she said.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s not a mild disease, and if you\u2019re the parent of one of those children, you probably don\u2019t think so either,\u201d she told the paper.\n\nMullendore told CNN that no complications or hospitalizations have been reported from the outbreak at the Asheville Waldorf School.\n\nMajorities of all American religious groups agree that vaccines should be required for schoolchildren, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center study that asked participants about the common childhood vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. But some religious groups \u2015 particularly white evangelical Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated \u2015 expressed a little less support for requiring the MMR vaccine than others.\n\nSusan Sullivan, a nurse who serves as a consultant to the state\u2019s health departments on vaccine-preventable diseases, told the Citizen Times that pockets of unvaccinated people often serve as \u201creservoirs for disease.\u201d\n\nWhile chickenpox isn\u2019t life-threatening in most cases, the CDC says it can still be dangerous to infants, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sullivan said getting vaccinated helps protect the larger community."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Romaine Lettuce Is Unsafe To Eat, Should Be Thrown Out: CDC", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cdc-romaine-lettuce-outbreak-ecoli_us_5bf4676ee4b03b230f9c109f", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Health officials warned Tuesday that all romaine lettuce should be thrown away amid a new multistate outbreak of E. coli bacteria.\n\nThe advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention follows 32 confirmed cases of the bacteria in 11 states and Canada.\n\nOf those cases, 13 people have been hospitalized, including one person who experienced a type of kidney failure.

But because her husband is in the military, she instead gets her health care through Tricare Prime, the military\u2019s health management organization for family members of military personnel.\n\nAnd because of a federal law that bans the use of federal funds for abortions for fetal anomalies, the second-trimester termination would cost $6,000 to $10,000 out of pocket \u2015 something her family couldn\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cWhen the government starts taking a woman\u2019s right away and dictating how they can use their body, so begins the slippery slope into Gilead,\u201d Penchansky wrote, referring to the name of the \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d society that enslaves fertile women. \u201cThis is happening to me right now.\u201d\n\nA federal ban on abortion funding affects millions of Americans\n\nThe federal government has banned the use of federal funds for abortions since 1976, under what is known as the Hyde Amendment. It blocks states from using federal funds from Medicaid, Medicare or Children\u2019s Health Insurance programs to pay for abortions except in two instances: when a woman\u2019s life is in danger and when the pregnancy results from rape or incest.\n\nThis amendment has been used as the basis for more laws that prevent federal funding for abortion, said the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights advocacy organization. This includes laws that prevent the military from paying for abortions for fetal anomalies and extend to anyone employed by the federal government, anyone who gets health care through Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service and people in federal prisons or immigration detention centers.\n\nThese abortion restrictions affect millions of lives, Guttmacher notes. Tricare covers more than 9 million military members and their dependents, and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program for civilian federal employees covers more than 8 million people and their dependents.\n\nBecause Penchansky was young and healthy and had a previous uncomplicated pregnancy and birth, she didn\u2019t qualify for first-trimester screening tests covered by Tricare. It wasn\u2019t until she was 17 weeks along in her pregnancy that she received the results of her first fetal screening of any kind: the quad screen, a blood test that can detect signs of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, as well as some conditions in which the brain and spinal column don\u2019t develop properly.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t good. It showed that her baby had an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and that she needed to see a specialist right away. But there was added urgency for her. Because she got her health care through the military, which doesn\u2019t cover abortions for fetal abnormality, the longer she waited, the more expensive a termination would be.\n\nShe moved as fast as she could. A week later, an in-depth ultrasound with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist revealed that half her baby girl\u2019s heart hadn\u2019t developed, she had a large fluid-filled cyst running from her head all the way down her spine and there were large accumulations of fluid in the chest cavity affecting both lungs.\n\n\u201cI pretty much had a mental breakdown in the office,\u201d Penchansky told HuffPost. \u201cMy son was with me, and I was really losing it.\u201d\n\nStill, she held on to hope for her daughter that the amniocentesis, a test that can diagnose abnormalities or birth defects, would have promising news.\n\n\u201cI told [the doctor] I wouldn\u2019t terminate unless I knew what was wrong with the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just base it off of an ultrasound.\u201d\n\nThe results came back at week 20. Her baby was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, which the doctor had suspected because of the large spinal cysts and accumulation of fluid in her body. The chromosomal disorder, in which a female fetus has only one X chromosome instead of two, results in miscarriage 99 percent of the time.\n\nThe doctor talked to Penchansky about the \u201clethal nature\u201d of the combination of the baby\u2019s Turner syndrome, half-formed heart and growing cysts, according to a medical record of the appointment.\n\nShe decided to end the pregnancy as soon as possible rather than prolong the baby\u2019s suffering or expose herself to the risk of delivering of a full-term baby with extremely large cystic growths.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring a baby into the world that has a 1 percent chance of making it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m either going to watch her pass away early on, or she\u2019s going to suffer.\u201d\n\nAn abortion that far along is an anomaly in the U.S. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions performed in this country happen after 21 weeks gestation.\n\nHow abortion restrictions make a tragic situation stressful\n\nThe federal restrictions on abortions for fetal anomalies, in combination with state laws that continue to close abortion clinics or make the window of legal abortion smaller, mean more pressure on women and their families in what are already difficult circumstances.\n\nDr. Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles, wasn\u2019t involved in Penchansky\u2019s case but reviewed her anonymized medical records.\n\nHe said that women like her are dealt a severe blow when they receive news about fatal fetal anomalies and that the situation is made worse by the \u201cexternal forces\u201d like gestational age cutoffs for abortions, restrictions on medical counseling and waiting periods for abortion that encroach on discussions between patients and doctors.\n\n\u201cI feel strongly that what I might do personally is not what any given woman or family might do, and counseling needs to be able to take all options into consideration, not just pregnancy termination,\u201d said Silverman, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. \u201cThat said, termination can\u2019t be limited by external forces from the critical patient-physician discussion.\u201d\n\nPenchansky agreed. She said the lack of health insurance coverage for the procedure turned an already trying and difficult period of life for her into something stressful and expensive too.\n\nAfter deciding to terminate, she listened to her baby\u2019s heartbeat with a Doppler fetal monitor every day, but now with the hope that the baby inside her would die before her scheduled abortion.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t find a heartbeat, I can go down to labor and delivery on the Army base,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey can check, confirm, and then [I] wind up with the dilation and evacuation on the Army base \u2015 and Tricare will pay for it.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t end up happening.\n\nInstead, she went through with the abortion \u2015 an induced birth, because she was so far along and the baby\u2019s heart was still beating \u2015 on Nov 15. But by the time she gave birth, the baby no longer had a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cMy body thinks I have a baby to feed, my belly is still swollen, and I have typical bleeding,\u201d wrote Penchansky in an email to HuffPost a few days after the procedure. \u201cI have moments where I keep busy and don\u2019t think about it, and moments where something triggers me and I break down.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to grieving the loss of their very much wanted baby girl, she keeps ruminating on the cost of the abortion.\n\nPenchansky said she believes that if she could have had a screening test like a nuchal translucency scan in the first trimester, the problems would have been caught sooner \u2015 and she could have easily afforded a $1,000 first trimester abortion at a local Planned Parenthood. In the end, her parents ended up lending her $10,000 for the second-trimester abortion.\n\nSilverman said that it was difficult to say at this point whether the baby\u2019s issues would have been visible in a first-trimester ultrasound but that it was possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that with a large fluid collection like a cystic hygroma seen in the second trimester, that the nuchal translucency typically measured on ultrasound in the first trimester as a screening test might have been enlarged as well,\u201d he said. This would have then triggered more diagnostic testing like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis earlier, which would have found the Turner syndrome faster.\n\nKevin Dwyer, a spokesman for Tricare, didn\u2019t comment directly on Penchansky\u2019s case but said that the health plan complies with federal laws banning abortion except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\nHe also said that Tricare\u2019s schedule for ultrasounds and other prenatal care is in line with guidelines published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommends a first-trimester ultrasound only if the mother has certain symptoms or risk factors.\n\nLike many other military family members during deployment, Penchansky went through all this without her spouse by her side. He is stationed in Texas and didn\u2019t go home for the termination.\n\nThey decided that together, she explained, because it took him one year to qualify for the specialized military training that he\u2019s doing now. Instead, her sister and brother-in-law went to be with her and care for her 5-year-old son while she was in the hospital.\n\nHer boy is old enough to know she was pregnant but too young to understand why the pregnancy ended without a baby sibling for him. In the weeks leading up to the induction, Penchansky tried explaining to him several times that the baby in her belly was very sick and that she needed to go to the hospital to take the baby out.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he understands, and he says \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut then he tells his speech therapist that we\u2019re having a girl.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Meet The Pioneering Doctor Who Broke Ground For Transgender Rights More Than A Century Ago", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/magnus-hirschfeld-trans-rights-activist_us_5bf444b8e4b0ed30064896c5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "By Elizabeth Heineman, University of Iowa/The Conversation\n\nThe Trump administration continues its assault on transgender rights.\n\nIn July 2017, Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military. Then, this past October, The New York Times obtained a memo indicating that the administration was considering narrowly defining gender \u201cas a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth.\u201d Anyone wishing to challenge their officially-assigned sex would have to have the matter resolved by genetic testing.\n\nThose opposed to recognizing gender identity sometimes call it a form of \u201cradical gender ideology\u201d or \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d gone too far.\n\nBut recognition of transgender identity is no recent phenomenon: Some doctors acknowledged gender nonconforming people far earlier than most might realize. Perhaps the most important pioneer was German physician Magnus Hirschfeld, who was born 150 years ago, in 1868. As a historian of gender and sexuality in Germany, I\u2019m struck by how he paved the way for the legal recognition of gender nonconforming people.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld, on the right, sits with his partner, Tao Li, at the fourth conference of the World League for Sexual Reform in 1932. Wellcome Images, CC BY\n\nHirschfeld\u2019s \u2018sexual intermediaries\u2019\n\nIn recent years, the medical and psychological professions have come to a consensus that sex assignment at birth is inadequate for understanding individuals\u2019 sexual and gender identity \u2013 and that failure to recognize this fact can have a devastating impact.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld was the first doctor to openly research and advocate for people whose gender did not correspond with their sex assignment at birth.\n\nHe\u2019s often remembered today as an advocate of gay rights, and in the early 20th century, his activism played a major role in nearly overturning Germany\u2019s law criminalizing male same-sex relations.\n\nBut Hirschfeld\u2019s vision extended much further than homosexuality. He defined his specialty as \u201csexual intermediaries,\u201d which included everyone who did not fit into an \u201cideal type\u201d of heterosexual, cis-gendered men and women.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, sexual intermediaries included many categories. One type was cis-gendered people who were gay, lesbian or bisexual. Another consisted of transvestites: people who comfortably identified as their assigned sex but who preferred to dress in the clothing assigned to the other sex. Yet others were \u201ctrans\u201d in a more radical direction, like those who wanted to live fully as their non-assigned sex or longed for sex-change surgery.\n\nA relentless advocate\n\nAs a gay man, Hirschfeld was aware of the legal and social dangers sexual intermediaries faced.\n\nSince sexual intermediaries often turned to their doctors for help, Hirschfeld worked to educate the medical community. He published medical journals including the \u201cYearbook on Sexual Intermediaries\u201d and the \u201cJournal of Sexual Science.\u201d In 1919, he founded the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin to promote further research.\n\nIn court he gave expert testimony on behalf of men who had been accused of violating Germany\u2019s law banning male same-sex relations.\n\nHe even co-wrote and made a cameo appearance in the world\u2019s first feature-length movie featuring a gay protagonist: the 1919 silent film \u201cAnders als die Anderen\u201d (\u201cDifferent from the Others\u201d).\n\nNor did Hirschfeld shy away from political engagement. In 1897, he founded the \u201cScientific Humanitarian Committee\u201d to advocate for gender and sexual rights.\n\nThen, from 1897 to 1898, Hirschfeld worked to decriminalize male same-sex relations in Germany. He collected over 5,000 signatures from Germans willing to be publicly identified with the effort, including such luminaries as Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. A bill decriminalizing male homosexual acts gained only minority support when it was introduced in Parliament in 1898, but a new bill was reintroduced after the First World War. In the more progressive environment of the Weimar Republic, the bill advanced to parliamentary committee, only to stall when the Great Depression hit in 1929.\n\nImportantly, Hirschfeld\u2019s advocacy extended well beyond the decriminalization of gay male sex.\n\nLike most European countries, Germany had \u2013 and still has \u2013 an \u201cinternal passport,\u201d a government-issued ID that citizens are expected to carry with them. Germans whose passport indicated \u201cmale\u201d but who dressed in female clothing were subject to police harassment or arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nTogether with a colleague, Hirschfeld in 1910 convinced the Berlin police to accept a \u201ctransvestite certificate,\u201d signed by a doctor, to nullify such charges. After World War I, he convinced the Prussian judiciary to permit legal name changes from gender-specific names to gender-neutral names, which enabled trans people to present as the gender that was most true to themselves.\n\nNot all sexual minorities in Germany endorsed Hirschfeld\u2019s views. Early twentieth-century Germany was a politically and culturally diverse place, and that diversity extended to same-sex and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nSome gay men, for example, argued that far from being an \u201cintermediary\u201d sexual type, they were the most masculine men of all: After all, they didn\u2019t form close bonds with women. The vision of these \u201cmasculinists\u201d had little room for lesbians, bisexuals, or trans people.\n\nA life\u2019s work goes up in flames\n\nBy contrast, Hirschfeld\u2019s approach was all-inclusive. In his view, all \u201csexual intermediaries\u201d \u2013 whether L, G, B, T, Q, or I in today\u2019s parlance \u2013 were worth recognizing and protecting. He once calculated that there were 43,046,721 possible variants of human sexuality. That was simply another way of saying that the human species was infinitely diverse.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d he said, \u201cis as varied as people are.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hirschfeld, who was Jewish, was on tour lecturing on sexual science. From abroad, he watched newsreels of his Institute for Sexual Science set aflame by Nazi Storm Troopers. Thousands of unique medical records, publications, photos and artifacts were destroyed.\n\nStudents organized by the Nazi party parade in front of the building of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin prior to pillaging it on May 6, 1933. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nHirschfeld died two years later, and materials confiscated by the Nazis became evidence against gender and sexually-nonconforming people in the Third Reich. Male same-sex relations weren\u2019t decriminalized in East Germany until 1968, and in West Germany until 1969. Full legal equality had to wait even longer.\n\nNearly a century after Hirschfeld\u2019s institute burned, only tentative progress has been made in ending discrimination based on gender identity. And that progress is at risk.\n\nYet no bureaucratic definition of \u201csex\u201d will change what Hirschfeld so clearly demonstrated over 120 years ago: Trans people exist."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Now That I Can Only Eat With A Feeding Tube, Thanksgiving Has A New Meaning For Me", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feeding-tube-thanksgiving_us_5be48070e4b0e84388956371", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "For most of my life, the idea of healthy eating flew out the window on Thanksgiving Day. Like most Americans, I would eat myself sick.\n\nBut seven years ago, throat cancer stole my ability to eat. After a 15-hour surgery rooting through arteries and nerves, I was left with a crater in my right temple and an inability to swallow even a sip of water. The doctors surgically installed a permanent feeding tube next to my bellybutton so I could pump liquid protein and receive all of my nutrition. I had survived the surgery and the cancer had been removed, but I was far from OK.\n\nI had never had a complicated relationship with food \u2015 rather, it had been a reciprocal love affair. I relished cooking, entertaining and being served the finest, freshest food available.\n\nThe natural rhythm of my day, from coffee to 5 p.m. wine, suddenly was gone. I was the one who had to shop for and cook for my family, and I longed for the feel of food in my mouth, as well as for the joy of breaking bread with friends and family. Depression blossomed. I lost my sense of humor, and the enthusiasm I\u2019d had for my lucky life as a stay-at-home mom who was married to a great man. I lost all sense of joy.\n\nWe are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering.\n\nHolidays were the worst, especially Thanksgiving. All the Thanksgivings I\u2019ve hosted in my wonderful old house have blended together in my memory because my family does the exact same thing every year \u2015 and it\u2019s based on the overabundance of food, stemming from our Italian heritage.\n\nMy first Thanksgiving without being able to eat was disturbing, overwhelming and completely unraveling. The challenge of not eating on a day that has always been focused on food seemed insurmountable. I sulked and stayed in my room for most of the time. I could hear the din of laughter in the dining room, the joy that comes from food and coats the pain and injustice of life. I cried, and then went downstairs to try to show that this giant problem was really no problem at all.\n\nIn the seven years since my stomach tube was put into place, I have listened to many sermons, taken hundreds of yoga classes, studied spiritual awakening books and been in therapy. I\u2019ve learned to try to let go of fear, commit to unconditional happiness, love what is and not be controlling. The message is loud and clear in our contemporary spiritual supermarket: clinging to an idea or having an expectation can kill a moment, or a day or a lifetime.\n\nHowever, implementing those beliefs is not as easy as intellectually understanding the concepts behind them. It takes discipline and meditation and intention. Inspired by my children, I decided to do the work. They needed a real mom, not a zombie mom. I forced myself to climb my way out of a very deep hole and to find a new way of thinking and living.\n\nBut Thanksgiving was still the day I seemed to forget everything I thought I\u2019d learned.\n\nGradually, over the years, I came to realize that I could, in fact, consume other things. I could consume things in my surroundings \u2015 my comfortable home, or intellectually stimulating creative endeavors that fed my mind, like painting or reading a great book. We are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering. There is this choice.\n\nThe walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nThere is also a physical element of being deprived of eating with my mouth. With every small bite of food or sip of wine, the body releases chemicals that makes us feel good. But feeding the brain with appreciation for sunsets, flowers and friendships \u2015 delicacies for our soul \u2015 produces the same good chemicals. I have come to believe that the diet of my thoughts can and must be selected very, very carefully.\n\nWith my decision made \u2015 and that\u2019s the key, making the decision \u2015 there has been progress. But to conquer the fortress of Thanksgiving, I had to practice for seven years to stop fantasizing about something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. It took training, as for a marathon. Slowly, though, the walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nSo last Thanksgiving I decided I was going to have a zero-calorie, zero-resentment version of the old tradition. It would be a spiritual banquet for me.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude. My family typically has been especially grateful for the appetizers \u2015 fresh ricotta cheese, mozzarella made the day before by an old Italian man who learned from his mother, prosciutto and bread and dried peppers soaked in oil and hot pepper flakes. Things that would be a meal on any other day. But last year, I thought about them with my new focus. I thought about how it was the only time of the entire year where my brother and sister stood around the table in my home to be with my family for two days.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude.\n\nWhen the appetizer frenzy began early in the day and the long kitchen farm table was loaded with treasures from Arthur Avenue, my loved ones became my treasures.\n\nI was nourished by the fact that I\u2019d brought everyone together. When they were loading up their pieces of bread with fresh ricotta, I loaded up on their joyful energy. My son gave me several warm gravy hugs during the day; my daughter\u2019s personality, as she peppered the day with a few sarcastic comments, made me smile. I drank in the love of my husband like I was slowly sipping a full-bodied Barollo. I was aware my stomach remained empty, but I did not focus on it. Better for me. No one acknowledged my ongoing struggle with food, and I simply stopped feeling mad about that.\n\nMy banquet was all easily digested, no bloating or weight gain. At the end of the day, I felt full in a new way. I had feasted on the joy of sitting with my sister and brother, people I started out my life with and with whom I felt a tribal communion, beings who had inhabited the planet with me for my entire life. Our collective experience was all the nourishment I needed. A silent prayer of gratitude was the dessert.\n\nI\u2019d won the lottery, beaten impossible odds, and I still got to be here to see and feel it all. That was grace, no matter what I thought my life should be. And this is exactly how I plan to enjoy my Thanksgiving this year: full of gratitude."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Executive Sheryl Sandberg Calls Explosive NYT Report 'Simply Untrue'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheryl-sandberg-new-york-times-facebook-report_us_5bee3e55e4b0510a1f2f524d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cI\u2019ve said many times before that we were too slow to spot Russian interference and we certainly stumbled along the way,\u201d Zuckerberg said during a press conference, \u201cbut to suggest we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth or wanted to hide what we knew or wanted to prevent investigations is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nThe platform also issued a separate statement on its blog Wednesday, announcing that it had severed ties with Definers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf \u2015 or to spread misinformation,\u201d Facebook wrote. \u201cDefiners did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of \u2018Freedom from Facebook,\u2019 an anti-Facebook organization.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "In Extraordinary Statement, Trump Stands With Saudis Despite Khashoggi Killing", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-khashoggi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump defied the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and a growing body of evidence on Tuesday to declare his unswerving loyalty to Saudi Arabia, asserting that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s culpability for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi might never be known.\n\nIn a remarkable statement that appeared calculated to end the debate over the American response to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, the president said, \u201cIt could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nHis statement, which aides said Mr. Trump dictated himself and reflected his deeply held views, came only days after the C.I.A. concluded that the crown prince, a close ally of the White House, had authorized the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and columnist for The Washington Post."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "News Analysis: In Pardoning Saudi Arabia, Trump Gives Guidance to Autocrats", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/trump-khashoggi-statement.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has long viewed foreign policy as a series of business deals, stripped of values and idealism.

American jobs outweigh American values. And all countries act abhorrently, so an American president should never hold friends to different standards than enemies.\n\nTuesday\u2019s message could become something of a blueprint for foreign leaders \u2014 a guide to how they might increase their standing in the eyes of the American president as well as how far they can go in crushing domestic critics without raising American ire.\n\nIt was also a revealing meditation on the role that Mr. Trump believes facts should play in political decision-making.

But on Tuesday, the president dismissed not only that assessment but also the very process of seeking the truth, implying that it did not really matter anyway. (\u201cMaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote of Prince Mohammed.) Instead, the decisions of a president should be guided by what is best for the economy and the United States\u2019 security."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump\u2019s Statement on Saudi Arabia, Explained!", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/trump-statement-saudi-arabia-explained.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump released an exclamation-point-filled statement on Tuesday about the assassination of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.\n\nHere is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!\n\nWell, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding.\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\n\nMr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nLikewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\n\nThis is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.\n\nIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nBaloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nHere, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\n\nMr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.\n\nKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nWho knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials.\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nRemember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\n\nOther presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nAs President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\nIn 1979, William Safire, the New York Times columnist and former presidential speechwriter, offered readers of this newspaper some sage advice: \u201cDon\u2019t overuse exclamation marks!!!\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Trump Wanted to Order Justice Dept. to Prosecute Comey and Clinton", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/president-trump-justice-department.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B.

It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.\n\nHere is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!\n\nWell, indeed it is! But not so dangerous, perhaps, that one should expect to be assassinated in a consulate while going to collect paperwork for a wedding.\n\nThe country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more.\n\nMr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.\n\nLikewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster that has created the worst famine the country has seen. Despite calls from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a cease-fire, Saudi Arabia has stepped up its military operations. The Saudi military\u2019s lack of discipline and planning in its airstrikes has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, according to American officials. Regional experts say the Trump administration\u2019s most decisive action against Saudi Arabia so far has been to cut off aerial refueling flights for Riyadh\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nAdditionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.\n\nThis is a prime example of Mr. Trump\u2019s brutally transactional foreign policy. He is supporting Saudi Arabia because he thinks it is critical for the United States\u2019 defense industry. Saudi Arabia spends huge amounts on its military, and the United States is a beneficiary. However, the president\u2019s numbers are exaggerated. Trouble in the Saudi economy has led the government to slow roll some of the pledges to buy high-ticket items, including the missile defense system known as Thaad.\n\nIf we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\n\nBaloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.\n\nThe crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.\n\nHere, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nRepresentatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime.\n\nMr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.\n\nKing Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\n\nWho knows! Can we ever really know what happened behind closed doors? Mr. Trump is clearly waiting for the kind of evidence shown on television: a recording of the crown prince giving the order or a confession of one of the kill team members. But former intelligence officers say that is not how it works. The puzzle pieces are never all present. Even without the smoking gun, enough evidence has emerged for C.I.A. officials to conclude that Prince Mohammed gave the order, according to current and former officials.\n\nThat being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!\n\nRemember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.\n\nI understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world.\n\nOther presidents have often shied away from talking about what lies at the heart of the strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil production and low gas prices. Not Mr. Trump. And, surprising as it may seem, he is correct about the United States being the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nAs President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!\n\nIn 1979, William Safire, the New York Times columnist and former presidential speechwriter, offered readers of this newspaper some sage advice: \u201cDon\u2019t overuse exclamation marks!!!\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Trump Wanted to Order Justice Dept. to Prosecute Comey and Clinton", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/politics/president-trump-justice-department.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told the White House counsel in the spring that he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute two of his political adversaries: his 2016 challenger, Hillary Clinton, and the former F.B.I. director James B.

Many with diabetes no longer need insulin. Cholesterol and blood pressure levels tend to fall. Sleep apnea disappears. Backs, hips and knees stop aching.\n\nThere are not nearly enough surgeons or facilities to operate on all the obese people who might be helped by bariatric surgery, noted Randy Seeley, director of the nutrition research center at the University of Michigan.\n\nAnd many patients and doctors persist in thinking \u2014 all evidence to the contrary \u2014 that if overweight people really set their minds to it, they could get thin and stay thin.\n\nScientists got an unsparing look at what they were up against 50 years ago, when a clinical researcher at Rockefeller University, Dr. Jules Hirsch, did some old-fashioned experiments. He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.\n\nThe subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.\n\nDr. Hirsch and Dr. Rudy Leibel, now at Columbia University, repeated the study again and again, with the same result. Eventually, they found that when a very fat person diets down to a normal weight, he or she physiologically comes to resemble a starving person, craving food with an avidity that is hard to imagine.\n\nThe lesson never really penetrated the popular consciousness. Just a couple of years ago, Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, made headlines with a study of contestants from the Biggest Loser television show.

The oldest person on record was Jeanne Calment, a Frenchwoman, who died in 1997 at the age of 122. In 2040, the average life span for people in Spain, projected to pass Japan as the country with the longest-lived citizens, will reach about 86 years.\n\nThere is considerable dispute, however, over how long humans might live under optimal circumstances. In 2016, a team of scientists declared the upper limit to be 115 years. But in June, researchers reviewing death rates among elderly Italians suggested that there may be no limit at all.\n\nIn animal studies over the last few decades, scientists have begun to understand the specific cellular and molecular processes that cause the deteriorations of old age."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Task Force Calls for Offering PrEP to All at High Risk for H.I.V.", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/well/live/hiv-aids-prevention-prep.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-21 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "An influential government task force has drafted a recommendation that would for the first time urge doctors to offer a daily prophylactic pill to patients who are at risk for contracting H.I.V.

If approved, it would greatly expand access to the $20,000-a-year drug regimen, since most private health plans are required under the Affordable Care Act to cover the full cost of the preventive services recommended by the panel.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely fantastic news and validates everything science has been saying all along,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Lord, a physician at New York University School of Medicine who co-founded the PrEP4All Collaboration, which aims to expand access to PrEP for all Americans. \u201cWe\u2019ve known this is a very effective medication for quite a while, and feel we could be a lot further along in using it to reduce infections.
