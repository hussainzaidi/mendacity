His comments capped off a chaotic day of an attempted large-scale attack on prominent Democratic figures, including Obama's former CIA director John Brennan and attorney general Eric Holder, as well as California Rep. Maxine Waters, who Trump has attempted to elevate as the face of the Democratic Party. A day earlier, an explosive device was found at the home of George Soros, the liberal donor who is a subject of right-wing conspiracy theories.\nDuring a rally in Wisconsin, the President promised to bring those responsible for mailing the explosive devices to justice and broadly condemned violence, without specifically naming the targets of Wednesday's bombs. \n\"Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself. No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, corrosion or control, we all know that. Such conduct much be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted,\" he said. \n\"We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. It'll happen.\"\nThen he pivoted, saying those in the political arena \"must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective.\" \n\"The language of moral condemnation and destructive, routine -- these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop,\" said Trump, who has routinely labeled Waters \"crazy,\" referred to the news media as the \"enemy of the people,\" called those who held up his Supreme Court nominee \"people that are evil\" and blamed \"both sides\" when a neo-Nazi ran over and killed a counter-protester in Charlottesville, Virginia. \nTrump took no responsibility for his own rhetoric -- which has included attacks on news outlets and Democratic opponents, as well as moments like a recent rally in Montana where he praised a Republican congressman who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his body-slamming a reporter. \nHe complained of \"mobs\" -- a reference to protesters, who opposed Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination and confronted Republican senators on Capitol Hill, and who have challenged GOP lawmakers and Trump Cabinet officials at restaurants and in public. \n\"No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often and all the time. It's got to stop. We should not mob people in public spaces or destroy public property. There is one way to settle our disagreements -- it's called peacefully, at the ballot box. That's what we want,\" Trump said. \nHe then said it's the news media's responsibility to set the national political tone. \n\"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it,\" he said.  \nHe resumed his usual attacks on Democrats, falsely claiming that \"the Democrat Party is openly encouraging caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to violate our laws and break into our country.\" He complained the treatment Kavanaugh, saying that \"they made him suffer.\" He claimed a 10% tax cut for the middle class is coming \"soon\" -- a pledge that comes less than two weeks from the midterm elections, but has never been proposed as a bill in Congress. \nAfter criticizing Democrats on taxes and regulations, Trump touted how \"nice\" he was being. \n\"And by the way, do you see how nice I'm behaving tonight?\" Trump asked the crowd. \"Have you ever seen this? We're all behaving very well.\" \n\"And hopefully we can keep it that way, right? We're going to keep it that way,\" he added.\n\n"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Hear Trump's comments on the suspicious packages", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/BKwZN8a6RD4/trump-response-suspicious-packages-sot-nr-vpx.cnn", "media": [{"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-super-169.jpg", "height": "619", "width": "1100"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-large-11.jpg", "height": "300", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-vertical-large-gallery.jpg", "height": "552", "width": "414"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-video-synd-2.jpg", "height": "480", "width": "640"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-live-video.jpg", "height": "324", "width": "576"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-vertical-gallery.jpg", "height": "360", "width": "270"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-story-body.jpg", "height": "169", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-assign.jpg", "height": "186", "width": "248"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-hp-video.jpg", "height": "144", "width": "256"}], "accessed_time": "2018-10-24 21:42:48", "body_paragraphs": ""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: He divided us.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n (CNN)In President Donald Trump's brief remarks Wednesday about bombs mailed to prominent Democrats who stand in opposition to him, and to the media organization Trump has repeatedly demonized, he did the least a President could do. Although he used words such as \"abhorrent\" and \"despicable,\" Trump struggled to sound like a true leader of a nation wracked by political conflict that he has intensified to critical mass. \nHis quiet tone of voice came across as insincere to anyone who is familiar with the intensity of his rally performances, and his failure to mention CNN, the media outlet targeted, exposed where his heart truly lies. This is a man who views the objects of his anger and mockery as less-than-deserving of respect, and who lacks the instinct for decency. He waited for his Vice President, and his daughter, Ivanka, to offer words of support for the targets before he tweeted three mere words -- \"I agree wholeheartedly!\"\nComing from a man who has often electrified the internet with tweets before the nation is even awake, this response was a pathetic effort.\nThen, when he spoke publicly Wednesday afternoon about the threats, Trump offered weak words about bipartisan unity. \nIt wasn't until Wednesday night, at a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, that he took a concrete stance, saying  \"any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself. ... There is one way to settle our disagreements, it's called peacefully at the ballot box.\"\n \nBut, given Trump's track record, these words carry little weight. Trump campaigned as a divider with no pretense of uniting the nation. As he vilified the national media, especially CNN, he sought to dehumanize reporters as \"scum,\" \"horrible,\"  and, worst of all,  \"enemy of the people.\" \nDuring his campaign, Trump wistfully recalled the days when protesters were brought away from events \"on stretchers\" and offered to pay legal fees should a supporter attack a dissenter at a Trump rally. Now, he has no standing to call for peace and unity.\n \nHillary Clinton, who is still subject to chants of \"lock her up!\" at Trump rallies, was smeared as \"crooked Hillary,\" as if she were really a criminal. And who doesn't remember the years-long effort Trump made to cast doubt on President Obama's legitimacy with divisive, conspiracy-theory rhetoric about his birthplace?  \nWe have no idea who sent the bombs and no idea what the motive was. But what we can say is that the conspiracy theories Trump promotes, like the violent rhetoric he uses, have degraded the political environment to the point at which the kind of terrorism that comes with mail bombs is not a surprise. This trouble was foreshadowed during the campaign when two men attacked a Hispanic man in Massachusetts while saying \"Donald Trump was right. All these illegals need to be deported.\"\nAnother instance of Trump-galvanized violence featured one of his supporters cold-cocking a protester at a rally; and yet another saw a reporter man-handled by Trump's campaign manager at a press conference.\nMore recently, a California man who possessed 20 firearms was arrested after threatening staff at the Boston Globe. He had used Trump's \"enemy of the people\" line in his calls to the paper.\nGiven the President's construction of an alternate universe where he's permitted to utter lies by the thousands without ever taking responsibility, his inept attempt to address Wednesday's bomb threats was, perhaps, inevitable. Trump has consistently played with the fire of violent talk and has thrived on a strategy of going where others, for good reason, won't. Many of his fellow Republicans have seemingly lost the will to rebuke him, and he has so thoroughly divided the nation that a subset of Americans thrive on the energy of his hateful speech. \nAs President, he has legitimized rage, set the conditions for the danger that is on the rise, and diminished our ability to even engage each other with goodwill and civility.  \nTrump's rhetoric long ago crossed a line. Now he can never be the leader who can bring us back to where we were before he came along with his diatribes and anger. \nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted President Trump at his rally in Wisconsin. \n\n"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Jeffrey Toobin blasts Trump's 'ridiculous' statement", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/l8QxOZ25Ijw/suspicious-packages-trump-rhetoric-toobin-tsr-sot-vpx.cnn", "media": [{"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-super-169.jpg", "height": "619", "width": "1100"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-large-11.jpg", "height": "300", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-vertical-large-gallery.jpg", "height": "552", "width": "414"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-video-synd-2.jpg", "height": "480", "width": "640"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-live-video.jpg", "height": "324", "width": "576"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-vertical-gallery.jpg", "height": "360", "width": "270"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-story-body.jpg", "height": "169", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-assign.jpg", "height": "186", "width": "248"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024142548-trump-suspicious-packages-statement-oct-24-hp-video.jpg", "height": "144", "width": "256"}], "accessed_time": "2018-10-24 21:42:49", "body_paragraphs": ""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump's attacks on the media have real-life consequences", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vAYcg5w08V8/index.html", "media": [{"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-super-169.jpg", "height": "619", "width": "1100"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-large-11.jpg", "height": "300", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-vertical-large-gallery.jpg", "height": "552", "width": "414"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-video-synd-2.jpg", "height": "480", "width": "640"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-live-video.jpg", "height": "324", "width": "576"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-vertical-gallery.jpg", "height": "360", "width": "270"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-story-body.jpg", "height": "169", "width": "300"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-t1-main.jpg", "height": "250", "width": "250"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-assign.jpg", "height": "186", "width": "248"}, {"medium": "image", "url": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181024114121-12-time-warner-center-1024-hp-video.jpg", "height": "144", "width": "256"}], "accessed_time": "2018-10-24 21:42:50", "body_paragraphs": " (CNN)Almost as soon as the bombs arrived in the mail, the debate began: What role does violent political rhetoric have on these real-life acts of violence? \nWell, truth be told, a version of this debate has been raging for a while. Witness the reactions to President Trump's recent praise of a congressman for body-slamming a reporter. But the debate has been renewed now, in the wake of the threatening deliveries to CNN's New York office and several prominent Democratic politicians on Wednesday.\nThe intended recipients all had something in common: They were frequent targets of right-wing criticism.\nOr as the Washington Post succinctly put it: \"Amid incendiary rhetoric, targets of Trump's words become targets of bombs.\"\nNews industry executives have repeatedly warned that Trump's reckless attacks against the media are having real-world consequences. Some journalists now travel to Trump rallies with security personnel, for example.\nIn a statement on Wednesday afternoon, CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker spoke out about the problem. \n\"There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,\" he said. \"The President, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.\"\nJournalism advocacy groups uphold this view as well. Dan Shelley, the head of Radio Television Digital News Association, pointed out the irony in Trump's recent statements.\nOn Wednesday, responding to the mailings, Trump said \"threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\"\nBut, Shelley said, \"those words were uttered by the same person who has used harsh rhetoric targeting journalists and political opponents during campaign rallies in an extremely tense and divisive political environment.\"\nShelley repeated a line he has used recently: \"Don't succumb to intimidation and fear,\" he said to fellow journalists. \"Watch your backs, but don't back down.\"\nAt a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday night, Trump accused the media of failing to help mend the political divide.\n\"The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories. Have to do it,\" he said.\nAs reports of suspicious packages piled up on Wednesday, many commentators and political observers urged caution and lamented the rush to judgment that many others were making.\nPartisans on the left and the right traded barbs, particularly on social media, where the hashtag #MAGABomber was the top trending topic on Twitter in the US. The hashtag's assertion was that the perpetrator supported Trump's \"MAGA,\" or Make America Great Again, message.\nSome prominent Trump supporters and far-right online personalities fought back by suggesting, without evidence, that the bombs were sent by a Democratic operative as part of a supposed \"false flag\" operation. This term refers to crimes committed by one party that are disguised to give the impression that they are committed by another group.\nRush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host who reaches millions of listeners each week, said on his Wednesday show that \"it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this.\"\n\"But flip that! Flip that around. Would it make a lot of sense for a Democrat operative or Democrat-inculcated lunatic to do it?\" Limbaugh asked, suggesting to his audience that it would because he argued the Democrats are worried they were ceding ground in the looming midterm elections.\nAnn Coulter, the best-selling conservative author, wrote on Twitter that \"bombs are a liberal tactic.\" \nAnd Candace Owens, the communications director for Turning Points USA, a conservative organization with close ties to the Trump family, wrote in a now-deleted tweet that \"the only thing 'suspicious' about these packages, is their timing.\"\n\"Caravans, fake bomb threats -- these leftists are going ALL OUT for midterms,\" Owens added.\nThe incendiary comments about the bomb incidents were not limited to Limbaugh, Coulter, and Owens. To the contrary, the spreading of conspiracy theories was a common theme among individuals on the fringes of the right. The behavior was condemned by numerous commentators on cable news. \nOn Fox News, \"Special Report\" anchor Bret Baier ended his hour by saying \"days like today remind us of the danger that does exist, and has been condemned from all sides. Our thoughts today were with our colleagues at CNN as they were dealing with this real time, and we're very happy everybody's okay.\"\nFox News head of human resources Kevin Lord issued an internal memo in which he expressed support for CNN.\n\"We condemn all attempted acts of violence against media organizations and our thoughts are with CNN for the safety of all of their employees,\" Lord said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ethiopia's president

took office in 2013 and had often spoken for a more democratic and inclusive government in the Horn of Africa country, which has faced political upheaval and unrest for many years.\nThe office of the Prime Minister leads Ethiopia's government and policy.\nLawmakers in the upper and lower houses of the country's parliament will meet to consider Teshome's resignation on Thursday, Ethiopia's News Agency reported.\nTeshome is a member of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization, one of the four parties of the ruling coalition Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.\nTeshome had previously taken ministerial and high-level diplomatic positions, representing the country in Japan and Azerbaijan.\nHe was Ethiopia's ambassador to Turkey before he was unanimously appointed president.\nTeshome's resignation comes after a political Cabinet reshuffle by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed that began last week and has seen half of the country's ministerial seats occupied by women.\nAbiy, 41, currently the continent's youngest leader, has taken radical steps since he took office in April, most recently the appointment of a female defense minister, the first for the nation.\nHe has freed many jailed journalists, bloggers and political prisoners arrested by previous administrations, along with honoring an agreement that ended a 20-year bloody border war with neighboring Eritrea.\n\n"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Saudi Crown Prince calls Khashoggi killing 'heinous' after inner circle

(CNN)Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday described the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi as a \"heinous\" crime in his first comments since some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist's death.\nSpeaking at an investors' conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by the crisis, bin Salman said those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice.\n\"This was a very, very painful incident for all Saudis and also for everybody on this planet. It was unnecessary,\" he said. \nThe crisis has presented a threat to bin Salman in a way that a bloody war in Yemen, the alleged abduction of the Lebanese Prime Minister and a crackdown on dissent at home have not. After Saudi Arabia admitted over the weekend that Khashoggi was killed October 2 in its Istanbul consulate, five high-ranking officials were dismissed, including bin Salman's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service. Eighteen people were arrested.\nRiyadh has maintained that neither bin Salman nor his father, King Salman, knew of the operation to target Khashoggi. US officials have said such a mission -- including 15 men sent from Riyadh --  could not have been carried out without the authorization of bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler.\n\"Saudi Arabia will go and implement all necessary rules and investigate deeply in order to achieve results. And to bring to justice those who are responsible for this heinous crime, and they will be put before courts,\" bin Salman told his audience in Riyadh on Wednesday.\nIn its public admission Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed that Khashoggi died when a discussion turned violent. In private, officials have offered a shifting narrative. In the latest version offered by an official, the original plan was to persuade Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia, and if he refused, to drug him and take him to a safe house in Istanbul. But Khashoggi became agitated, the official asserted, and he died in a chokehold.\nOn Wednesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih admitted the scandal of Khashoggi's killing was a blow to the kingdom.\n\"It's not a death, it's a murder. We admit it, we're dealing with it. As such, we will be transparent and show our allies and friends in the United States ... that the kingdom is as unhappy about what has happened as anybody else. In fact, we are more unhappy because it has tarnished the name of the kingdom,\" he said while speaking to CNN on the sidelines of the conference.\nHowever, he added that Saudi Arabia would emerge from the crisis stronger.\nTurkey has rejected the notion that Khashoggi fell victim to a rogue operation. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the death Tuesday as a \"ferocious\" premeditated murder. Speaking Wednesday at the presidential palace in Ankara, Erdogan once again made clear he was not satisfied with the Saudi explanation. \n\"We are determined not to allow those responsible -- those who ordered the crime and those who committed it -- to escape justice,\" he said.\nBin Salman insisted that good working relations between Saudi Arabia and Turkey should not suffer as a result of the crisis. \"We will be sure to see that we cooperate with each other, that justice will be done,\" he said.\nEarlier Wednesday, bin Salman and Erdogan discussed the journalist's killing in a phone call, according to Turkey's state news agency Anadolu and the Saudi Press Agency. The Saudi crown prince requested the call to discuss a joint effort to shed light on all aspects of the death, Anadolu reported, citing Turkish presidential sources. \nSaudis' new version of events\nIn the latest iteration of a shifting story, Saudi officials told CNN that the original plan was to convince Khashoggi, who had been writing critical columns in The Washington Post, to return to Saudi Arabia. If Khashoggi refused, an official said, the next step was to drug him with a tranquilizer and take him to a safe house in Istanbul for 48 hours. If Khashoggi still refused to return to Saudi Arabia at that point, the team was to leave, and a \"local collaborator\" was to let him go, the source said.\nThe Saudi official also claimed that a forensic expert was present to erase all evidence of Khashoggi's presence at the consulate and safe house, so that there would be no proof if the journalist later said he had been kidnapped. \nThe official provided no corroborating evidence for this new version of events. The New York Times has reported that the forensic expert was equipped with a bone saw. \nThe official said that of the 15 Saudis who took part in the operation, nine were at the consulate, with \"three or four to question him and the rest to handle logistics.\" There was no explanation why three to four people would be needed for questioning, or what logistics the others would attend to.\nThe rest of the 15-man team that Turkey said was a hit squad, including generals and their security detail, waited at the safe house, according to the source.\nTurkish officials have said that Khashoggi was set upon immediately after entering the consulate and then beaten, tortured and dismembered.\nTurkish investigators last week searched the Saudi Consulate and consul general's residence in Istanbul as they hunted for clues to Khashoggi's fate. A well-placed Turkish official told CNN on Wednesday that permission to search the well at the consul's residence was not given to Turkish investigators at that time.\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday described the Saudi handling of Khashoggi's death \"the worst cover-up ever.\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would be revoking the visas of those who killed Khashoggi, and said that the administration has \"identified at least some of the individuals responsible.\"\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain also was taking action against any Saudi suspects in Khashoggi's death and that any individuals holding UK visas would have them revoked.\n\"We condemn the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the strongest possible terms,\" she said. \"And after his disappearance we made clear that Saudi Arabia must cooperate with Turkey and conduct a full and credible investigation.\"\nCNN's John Defterios and Adrian Lydon reported from Riyadh and Elise Labott from Washington, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

the Duchess of Sussex, formerly known as Meghan Markle, to a market in the Fijian capital of Suva was cut short Wednesday after larger-than-expected crowds caused security concerns.\nA Kensington Palace spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that Meghan's \"engagement was shortened slightly due to crowd management issues.\" \nThousands reportedly waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the Duchess, who is pregnant with the royal couple's first child. Crowds cheered and sang, and waved British and American flags as she made her way through the market, greeting vendors.\nBefore she was whisked away by security, Meghan met members of the UN Markets for Change project, which seeks to promote a safe, inclusive environment for women vendors in a number of South Pacific nations.\nWhile Meghan was visiting the market and having tea at the British High Commissioner's residence, her husband Prince Harry made a trip to the Colo-i-Suva forest, which has become part of the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy, a conservation initiative designed to protect indigenous forests. \nThe Prince also took part in a ceremony at the National War Memorial, which commemorates both Fijian and British troops.\nThe Duke and Duchess are on a multi-country tour of the region.

The couple will visit Tonga and New Zealand before returning to Australia. \nRoyal return\nThe visit comes 65 years after Harry's grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, visited the island nation following the Queen's coronation. \nHarry and Meghan stayed at the same hotel as the Queen and Prince Philip in 1953, the Grand Pacific Hotel, and waved at well-wishers from the hotel's balcony before attending a state banquet held in their honor by the country's President Jioji Konrote.\nOn an official visit to the University of the South Pacific, both spoke, with Meghan giving a speech promoting education and women's rights. \n\"Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive.  And for women and girls in developing countries, this is vital,\" she said, wearing a traditional South Pacific lei. \nThe Prince warned of the perils of climate change, acknowledging its effect on low-lying Pacific Island nations. \n\"We know that young people are the future of the Commonwealth... you will be the ones most affected by the global challenges that face us all, but you are the leaders who are creating the solutions,\" he said. \n\"One of the greatest challenges is undoubtedly climate change and all of you living here are confronted with this threat in your daily lives.\" \n\n"}]
