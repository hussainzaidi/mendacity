McMaster, Mattis stayed.\n\nFears of a clash between the US and Chinese navies in the South China Sea, an opportunistic Russia, meltdowns in the Middle East or a sudden global crisis with Trump at the helm were eased by thoughts of the scholar-general in the chain of command.\n\nNow, he's going. And the world had better prepare for an unchained US President.\n\nShock and concern\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin: No more grown-ups in the room Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin: No more grown-ups in the room 01:23\n\n\"There is a lot of concern like I have never seen in my life,\" Adam Kinzinger, a Republican House member from Illinois, said on CNN, reflecting the sentiments of his colleagues at the events of the last few days.\n\nA senior conservative House GOP member, who supports Trump, told CNN's Jim Acosta: \"The wheels may be coming off.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio warned in a tweet that the Mattis resignation letter made it \"abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances & empower our adversaries.\"\n\nSuch unusual anxiety about Trump among Republicans on Capitol Hill suggested that Mattis might have achieved at least part of his aim in resigning.\n\nThough he addressed his letter to Trump, it was a warning clearly targeted at the lawmakers, especially Republicans, who so admire him. It was also aimed at Americans outside Washington, flagging that the nation is heading down a dangerous path.\n\nTrump's order of an immediate withdrawal from Syria -- the final straw for Mattis -- defied the counsel of his national security experts. Now, it also looks like the start of a period in which America's turmoil could destabilize the globe.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that Mattis was \"vehemently opposed\" to the Syria decision and a possible Afghanistan troop withdrawal.\n\nThe move appeared to have been conducted without consulting allies whose soldiers have fought and died alongside Americans in the 17 years since 9/11.\n\nTrump has every right as commander in chief, given the broad sweep of his constitutional powers and the victory he secured in 2016, to reshape America's posture around the globe. He made promises to bring US soldiers home from foreign battlefields -- a goal shared by many Americans weary of years of war.\n\nTrump's voters wanted someone to shake up Washington and the world and so are unlikely to care that he's spooking the Washington establishment with his populist nationalist approach to the world.\n\nBut critics charge that Trump's troop withdrawals will simply hand over tracts of the Middle East and southwest Asia to American's foes such as Iran, Russia, ISIS and the Taliban.\n\nAnother Republican who usually supports Trump, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, warned an Afghan withdrawal would pave the way \"toward another 9/11.\"\n\nA staggering repudiation\n\nJUST WATCHED Panetta: US going through steady diet of chaos Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Panetta: US going through steady diet of chaos 01:36\n\nMattis went further, suggesting that Trump is taking aim at the very foundations of US global power.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mattis suggested Trump's worldview was antithetical to everything he held dear in 40 years in uniform. Those values were not just his own, they are the bedrock of a nation that was a stabilizing force that made the world more safe.\n\nHe implied that Trump, who believed Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agents about Russian election meddling, and who has cozied up to dictators, such as Kim Jong Un, had got America's friends and enemies confused.\n\n\"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,\" Mattis wrote.\n\n\"We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,\" he continued.\n\nIn the coming days, the resignation of Mattis is likely to revive sobering questions over whether Trump is fit to be commander in chief and raised the possibility -- reinforced by a report that Trump is now planning an Afghan withdrawal -- that the President plans to engineer a single-handed retreat from world.\n\n\"The President has taken a wrecking ball to every pillar of stability and security we have erected over the past 60, 70 years,\" an emotional William Cohen, himself a former defense secretary, told CNN's Jim Sciutto.\n\nCohen spoke to Mattis on Wednesday night and said he was distraught over Trump's Syria order, which he viewed as a desertion of America's allies, especially the Kurds.\n\nParaphrasing his friend's mindset, Cohen added: \"'I have never resigned from anything, I have carried the fight in every battle I have been in, but I cannot do this in the name of our country.'\"\n\nIt is clear that Syria was the last straw for Mattis. But not the only one.\n\nThe defense secretary stood by as Trump has appeased Russia, which he sees as a dangerous US foe. He saw the President decide off-the-cuff to halt US military exercises on the Korean Peninsula after being charmed by Kim. Mattis was even forced to explain why Trump deployed troops to the southern border in a political stunt to bolster his hardline message on immigration. And he's seen Trump insult allied leaders to their faces at bitter global summits.\n\nGiven such developments, it's no longer absurd to ask questions like whether the President will suddenly decide to pull American troops home from South Korea after decades of keeping the peace or even pulling out of NATO.\n\n\"We are in a new world here ... \" former Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark said on \"Cuomo Prime Time.\" \"We've got to come to terms with the character of the President and how he makes decisions.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Retired General: This will be a real crisis", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/307y0h4k7zk/donald-trump-afghanistan-announcement-jake-tapper-lead-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Officials throughout the Trump administration are bracing themselves for the President to make an announcement about the US presence in Afghanistan, similar to his declaration that the US will withdraw the military from Syria, informed administration sources tell CNN."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "READ: James Mattis' resignation letter", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/joAEE_Rk6LM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Read his letter:\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nI have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.\n\nI am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.\n\nI pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump sparks fear across party lines", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/gACzURei5EY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Shaken, disappointed, saddened and scared -- those were just some of the reactions in a bipartisan outpouring of shock and concern as lawmakers reacted Thursday to the news that Defense Secretary James Mattis had resigned over President Donald Trump's policy decisions.\n\n\"Just read Gen.

Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\"\n\nNews of Mattis' resignation broke as Trump faced an imminent government shutdown, the Dow had plunged more than 1,200 points since Monday and the President was being blasted for foreign policy decisions. On Wednesday, Trump had announced that the US will pull its troops from Syria because \"we have defeated ISIS,\" and earlier Thursday, CNN's Jake Tapper reported that officials throughout the administration were bracing themselves for Trump to make an announcement about the US presence in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The wheels may be coming off,\" said a conservative House Republican who supports Trump, commenting on the news about Mattis' departure at the end of February.\n\nRetired Gen. Stanley McChrystal said that \"the kind of leadership that causes a dedicated patriot like Jim Mattis to leave should give pause to every American.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director Leon Panetta simply sounded furious. \"The last damn thing we need is more chaos and crisis,\" Panetta told CNN's Erin Burnett.\n\n\"This is a President who operates somehow by his gut instinct and how he reads the politics of the moment,\" Panetta said.\n\n\"He enjoys chaos\" because he believes it brings him more attention, \"but a steady diet of chaos creates hell for the American people,\" Panetta continued. \"We need a president who is going to make the right decisions and provide stability for this country.\"\n\n'Straw that broke the camel's back'\n\nMattis said in his resignation letter to Trump that \"because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\"\n\nThe letter capped months of tension over policy disagreements and amounted to a rebuke of several of Trump's foreign policy views. The defense secretary stressed the importance of US alliances and of being \"unambiguous\" in approaching adversaries like Russia and China.

How can you keep working for a boss whose policies you don't believe in?\"\n\nOthers called, directly and indirectly, for oversight and possibly intervention.\n\nWarner tweeted that \"as we've seen with the President's haphazard approach to Syria, our national defense is too important to be subjected to the President's erratic whims.\"\n\nRubio tweeted, \"I hope we who have supported this administrations initiatives over the last two years can persuade the President to choose a different direction.

Ben Sasse said it was a \"sad day\" for America.\n\n\"General Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear,\" the Nebraska Republican said in a statement. \"Mattis rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home. Isolationism is a weak strategy that will harm Americans and America's allies. Radical Islamic jihadists are still at war with us, and no ISIS is not gone.\"\n\nHouse Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry said he was \"disappointed\" that Mattis is leaving, though he said he wants to write out his thoughts before elaborating.\n\nAsked if he has any interest in the job, the Texas Republican jumped into an elevator and said he \"scoffed\" at the notion.\n\nThornberry's replacement, the incoming chairman of Armed Services, Rep. Adam Smith, said the news of Mattis' resignation is \"very disappointing.\"\n\n\"He will be missed,\" the Washington state Democrat said.\n\n'There is chaos now'\n\n\"I'm sad. I'm shaken by it. I had so much respect for him,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN. Like many, the California Democrat expressed discomfort at Trump's erratic and impulsive leadership style. Mattis had been a \"comfort to many of us as a voice of stability in the Trump administration,\" Pelosi told reporters later.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Mattis \"one of the few symbols\" of \"strength and stability\" in the administration. \"There is chaos now,\" he said.\n\n\"This week was one of the most chaotic weeks we've ever seen in American government,\" the New York Democrat added.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, headlining a town hall in Iowa on Thursday, responded to the news by suggesting that it is now only Trump and his adviser Stephen Miller making decisions together.\n\n\"I at least had some peace in knowing there were adults in the room, and now (chief of staff John) Kelly and Mattis are gone,\" the California Democrat said, calling the prospect of decisions by Miller and Trump \"terrifying.\"\n\nHe added: \"Some of the best hope for order at the White House, those people are leaving.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, sometimes seen as a possible candidate for defense secretary, tweeted that he'd learned of the news \"with great sadness.\"\n\nGraham, a strong Trump supporter who nonetheless opposes the President's decision to pull out of Syria, continued: \"Mattis is a combination of intellect and integrity. He has been in the fight against radical Islam for decades and provided sound and ethical military advice to President Trump.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Thursday, in strong comments by his standards: \"I believe it's essential that the United States maintain and strengthen the post-World War II alliances that have been carefully built by leaders in both parties. We must also maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes, and recognize that nations like Russia are among the latter. So I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis, who shares those clear principles, will soon depart the administration.\"\n\n\"But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America's global leadership,\" the Kentucky Republican said in a statement, \"It is regrettable that the president must now choose a new Secretary of Defense.

But the electromagnetic disturbance used to jam that signal would be nearly impossible to use at airports, as it would interfere with aircraft and communication systems.\n\nWhile geofencing for sensitive locations, such as prisons, is already in operation it doesn't always work -- not all drones need GPS or Wi-Fi, and some can work using artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The other measure is the ability to triangulate where the person is standing, who is doing the flying. And that's where our security services come in,\" Whitfield said.\n\nPassengers wait for announcements at Gatwick South Terminal.\n\nWhat could happen if an airplane hit a drone?\n\nIf a drone were to hit an aircraft's wing, it would probably cause damage but no serious danger, according to the CAA. However, if a drone were ingested by an engine, it would be catastrophic.\n\nWhitfield pointed out that every professional pilot is trained to handle a single engine failure, before adding: \"Let's say the drone is 7 kilos (15.4 lbs), going into the engine intake with a combination of plastic, batteries and minor metals, that would certainly take out the engine.\"\n\nOther risks include a direct collision with the fuselage or impact with the cockpit, which could crack the windscreen.\n\nWhitfield said that hitting a drone could also be as inconsequential as the impacts planes often have with geese or hail, but it's not worth the risk -- especially when drones are difficult to see even in daylight.\n\n\"I don't know any pilot that would launch a 300-ton aircraft out of Gatwick if there was a risk of collision with drone.\"\n\nWhat are the regulations for drones?\n\nDrones up to 7 kilos (15.4 lbs) are allowed to fly in airspace controlled by air traffic controllers, but they must never be flown higher than 120 meters (about 400 feet), according to Jon Parker, founder of Flyby Technology and a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot.\n\nThey are not allowed to be flown farther than 500 meters (1,640 feet) from their operators either, despite many having huge ranges. Some of the more powerful drones can be controlled from up to 16 kilometers (10 miles) away.\n\nHas anything like this happened before?\n\nBanks-Welsh, who also served with the Royal Air Force, said the incident at Gatwick didn't surprise him, but it was, in many ways, unprecedented.\n\n\"There have been near-miss incidents in the past, and (they have become) probably more prevalent over the last 6 months, I would say. There's been a build-up towards this sort of incident.

This means that whoever is responsible for the disruption at Gatwick likely brought their drones back to the ground to put in new batteries.\n\n\"Once drones are sighted over an airfield the authorities have no option but to suspend all flights. If they didn't and it led to a disaster then they would be slated,\" Parker said in a statement.\n\n\"We've seen nothing on this scale before although Manchester Airport did suspend all flights for a short time back in 2017 after a drone was seen.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Suspect linked to Charlie Hebdo attackers in French custody", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/AFw_xpjihQk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Photos: Reactions to Paris terror attack German President Joachim Gauck gives a speech in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate as political and religious leaders attend a Muslim rally to condemn the Paris terror attacks, promote tolerance and send a rebuke to a growing anti-Islamic movement on Tuesday, January 13.

The court also rebuffed a move by prosecutors late Thursday to challenge the rejection of the extension.\n\nA Nissan spokesman declined to comment on the court's decision, saying the pair's detention was a matter for prosecutors.\n\nGhosn and Kelly have been in detention since November 19. They were indicted last week on charges that they under-reported Ghosn's income between 2010 and 2015, and prosecutors received court approval to continue holding them over additional allegations that the misreporting continued into 2017.\n\nSince his arrest, Ghosn has been stripped of his role as chairman at Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors ( MMTOF ). Renault has appointed interim management but kept Ghosn on the payroll.\n\nNissan, which has also been indicted in the case, said the alleged misconduct was first brought to its attention by a whistleblower, which led to an internal investigation that uncovered serious problems. The company alerted prosecutors and began cooperating with them.\n\nDespite the court decision Thursday, Ghosn and Kelly's indictments mean they will still have to seek bail in order to be released. The prosecutors' office said it wasn't yet aware of a bail application by either of the men.\n\nThe office of Ghosn's lawyer in Tokyo didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe bail process makes it uncertain whether they will be let out of jail before the new year, said Kana Sasakura, a criminal law professor at Konan University in Kobe.\n\nReleasing them before trial would make it easier for their lawyers to prepare a defense, Sasakura added, but it depends on the judge hearing their bail applications.\n\n\"Some judges are pretty liberal about custody issues whilst others are not,\" she said. \"We will still have to see.\"\n\nGhosn has retained lawyers to represent him but has issued no public statement.

Now, it wants to get even more cyclists on the roads -- and will pay people to do it.\n\nThe Dutch government recently announced that it will invest $390 million (\u20ac345 million) in cycling infrastructure to get 200,000 more people commuting by bike in three years' time.\n\nFifteen routes will be developed into \"cyclist freeways\" (highways that cater to those on bikes), 25,000 bike parking spaces will be created and more than 60 bike storage facilities will be upgraded, according to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.\n\n\"My ambition is to ensure that people can easily get to work or school, or visit family and friends,\" says Stientje van Veldhoven, state secretary for that department, who is spearheading the project.\n\nRelated content Cycling in Amsterdam: How to pedal like a local\n\nGetting more people on bikes\n\nNetherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis. It's not that people aren't already cycling in the Netherlands. In 2016, over a quarter of all trips made by Dutch residents were by bike, according to theNetherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis.\n\nBut only 25% of those trips were work-related, compared to 37% which were made for leisure. The rest were for school, shopping, or other activities.\n\nAccording to van Veldhoven, more than 50% of people in the Netherlands live less than 15 kilometers from work, and more than half of commuters' car trips are under 7.5 kilometers long -- a distance that \"can easily be covered by bike,\" she says.\n\nStientje van Veldhoven (pictured) commutes by bike, according to the ministry. Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, Netherlands\n\nTo get people to ditch their cars, money is being laid on the table.\n\nThe Netherlands currently rewards commuting cyclists with tax credits of $0.22 (\u20ac0.19) per kilometer. Companies and employees would agree on the distance of a person's cycling route.\n\nHowever, this is currently a little-known benefit not supported by many employers, according to the infrastructure ministry. That's something the government is hoping to change by better promoting the scheme and getting more companies on board.\n\nThere are already 11 major employers in the Netherlands committing to measures such as financing employees' bikes. The government is urging employers to provide better facilities for commuting cyclists, such as showers at the office, according to the ministry.\n\nCycling culture\n\nToday the Netherlands is known for its cycling culture, but that hasn't always been the case.\n\n\"In the 1960s and 70s, many Dutch cities were making more space for the car and cycling was at an all-time low,\" says Meredith Glaser, a researcher at the Urban Cycling Institute at the University of Amsterdam. \"It wasn't until the late 1980s and early 90s that policies prioritizing cycling and walking were implemented.\n\nCycling in Utrecht, a historic city south of Amsterdam. Holland marketing\n\nA \"perfect storm of events\" led to high cycling rates. Among the contributing factors were the oil crisis of the 1970s, social movements in the 1960s and 1970s against the demolition of neighborhoods for the construction of freeways, and urban density and land uses that encouraged short trips.\n\nThe Netherlands is now \"one of the few countries that takes cycling seriously as a mode of transportation,\" adds Glaser.\n\nThe new cycling freeways include one between Amsterdam and Amstelveen, a suburb of the capital city. Another links the northern university town of Groningen with Assen, a city located in Drenthe, known as the \"cycling province\" of the Netherlands.\n\nConstruction will start within the next three years."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year. We are concerned that there are firms whose actions could be putting patients at risk and might be subject to additional action.\"\n\nThe only FDA-approved use for these umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products is for hematopoietic or immunologic reconstitution, meaning for people with disorders that affect the part of the system involved in producing blood, the hematopoietic system. That can be for blood or bone marrow transplants in patients who have cancer or blood or immune system disorders.\n\nSome practitioners believe that stem cells can \"sense the environment into which they are introduced and address whatever functions require replacement or repair,\" FDA scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2017, but that \"is not based on scientific evidence.\" These stem cell treatments need to go through the appropriate clinical trials to prove that they work and are safe.\n\nThe FDA warned the public about the unapproved use of stem cell treatments in 2017, saying \"unscrupulous providers\" may promise that stem cells can be \"miracle treatments\" for just about any disease or medical condition, but not to believe \"the hype.\" At the time, Gottlieb called them \"dangerously dubious products.\"\n\nThe patients infected in this outbreak got the stem cell treatments for ailments that include general pain, osteoarthritis, back pain, a rotator cuff tear with a cyst and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAccording to Thursday's CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the first infections were reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services on September 17. Three people who got injections or infusions of umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products at a Texas outpatient clinic on September 12 developed bloodstream infections.\n\nOn September 22, the Florida Department of Health was notified that four people had joint infections after getting injections from a Florida orthopedic clinic between February 15 and August 30. When scientists looked at some of the unopened products at that clinic, they found E. coli and E. faecalis bacteria.\n\nThe report does not offer details on the patient in Arizona. Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product. Perkins credited the health departments in Texas and Florida with picking up on infections quickly.\n\nThe FDA urges health care professionals and consumers to report any adverse events related to treatments with Liveyon products, Genetech products or other stem cell treatments to its MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.\n\nGottlieb noted that the field is growing quickly. There's a lot of innovation and promise, and some companies have come in to work with the FDA, but others have \"ignored our request for dialogue,\" he said, and are \"putting patients at risk.\"\n\nHe said Thursday that dozens of firms are not taking the necessary steps to ensure patient safety."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "A man accused of abusing a 13-year-old went free after the prosecutor came to court drunk", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/AEL2Ba8FdKQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An Iowa man accused of sexual abuse of a 13-year-old has been freed after county attorney Michelle Murphy Rivera was arrested for being drunk in court.\n\nA judge in Clarke County dismissed the case, saying the defendant didn't get a trial within a year of his arrest -- as mandated by Iowa's right to speedy trial law.\n\n\"The county attorney's unavailability at the last hearing was the finale following unexplained periods of inactivity and lack of responsiveness that prevented disposition of this case within one year,\" Iowa District Court Judge Martha L.

It is devoid of any praise for the President.\n\nThe resignation emerged at a chaotic moment in Trump's presidency: The US government is teetering on the edge of a government shutdown, the Trump administration is about to face the hot light of Democratic investigations and the President is grappling with the fallout of a series of firings and resignations.

Sources told CNN's Jake Tapper that the President has not yet made a final decision, but officials are concerned and convinced that he might do so, and soon.\n\nMattis is the latest senior administration to leave Trump's Cabinet, after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out the day after the midterm elections in November, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was unceremoniously fired in March and national security adviser H.R.

But I urge him to select a leader who shares Secretary Mattis's understanding of these vital principles and his total commitment to America's servicemembers.\"\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted, \"This is scary. Secretary Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a strong Trump supporter who opposes the President's decision to pull out of Syria, expressed \"great sadness\" over Mattis' resignation.\n\n\"He is one of the great military leaders in American history. He should be proud of the service he has rendered to President Trump and our nation,\" Graham tweeted.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that despite some disagreements with Mattis, \"we shared the view \u2014 long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation \u2014 that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer.\"\n\n\"It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs,\" Biden added . \"Secretary Mattis' presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.\"\n\n'A good guy'\n\nMattis' future was brought into question most recently after Trump, in an October interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" labeled him as \"sort of a Democrat,\" adding that the retired general \"may leave\" and that \"at some point, everybody leaves.\"\n\nHe also added that the 68-year-old Washington native was \"a good guy\" and the two had \"a very good relationship.\"\n\nMattis, a bachelor, has been described as a \"warrior monk,\" married to the Marines. He served in the first Gulf War and in Afghanistan. He once led the all-important US Central Command, which is in charge of the US military in the Middle East. He was also supreme allied commander of NATO.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Trump broke with protocol by tapping Mattis to be his secretary of defense, a position typically reserved for civilians.\n\nIn his first six months in office, Trump oversaw a steady transfer of power from the White House to the Pentagon, handing off several war-fighting authorities that previously rested in his hands -- and those of past presidents of both parties -- to the Pentagon and the commanders overseeing the US' military campaigns.\n\nBut while Mattis was widely considered one of Trump's most trusted advisers during his first year in office, his influence within the administration appeared to be waning in recent months as speculation swirled about a growing rift between the two men.\n\nBob Woodward's book \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" published in September, fueled that notion, detailing how senior aides, including Mattis, grew exasperated with the President and increasingly worried what they described as his erratic behavior, ignorance and penchant for lying.\n\nSpecifically, Woodward details several instances in which Mattis made disparaging comments about Trump and military actions he sought to take against Syria and North Korea.\n\nOne of the most striking accounts, according to Woodward, occurred after a charged meeting about South Korea, during which Trump wondered why the US backs Seoul. Woodward wrote that Mattis said Trump understands issues at the level of an elementary school student.\n\nMattis denied those assertions and the accounts detailed by Woodward's sources, including claims that he ignored or slow-rolled Trump's ideas."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Shaken, saddened, scared: Washington erupts over Mattis resignation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/gACzURei5EY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Shaken, disappointed, saddened and scared -- those were just some of the reactions in a bipartisan outpouring of shock and concern as lawmakers reacted Thursday to the news that Defense Secretary James Mattis had resigned over President Donald Trump's policy decisions.\n\n\"Just read Gen.

Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.\n\nI pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Jim Mattis' resignation letter is an absolutely stunning rejection of Trumpism", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/wO3HPSZrOwg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Lots of Cabinet officials -- and I mean LOTS -- have either resigned or been fired by President Donald Trump in his first 20 months in office.

While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.\"\n\nIn that single paragraph, which sums up the sentiment of the longer letter, Mattis rejects out of hand Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy that had led to clashes with a slew of longtime allies -- from Germany to Britain to Australia and back. From Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord to his recent announcement that the United States would be leaving Syria -- a decision with which Mattis disagreed -- Trump has shown time and time again that he rejects the post-World War II alliance structure that presidents, Republican and Democratic, have relied upon for more than seven decades.\n\nIt's impossible to read Mattis' letter as evidence of anything but a man who had been pushed well past his breaking point and, finally, snapped. Faced with a President who made enemies of our allies and allies of our enemies -- no one has arguably been happier with the Trump presidency than Russian President Vladimir Putin -- Mattis decided to walk away.\n\nWhich is remarkable, both by itself and when you consider the broader context of how and where Mattis fit into the Trump Cabinet and administration.\n\nIn a vacuum, Mattis was widely regarded by those familiar with his approach to the office as someone who simply would not walk away without a very good reason. A much-decorated military general, Mattis was part of a group within the Trump administration -- that once included chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- who viewed their roles in the administration as a duty to the country.\n\nStep back and you see Mattis' departure as a sort of bookend to Tillerson's removal as secretary of state, with Kelly's removal sandwiched in between. Together, those three men were cast -- by Trump and his allies -- as the crown jewels of the administration, men who had long experience in Washington and around the world and who, together, would form a shield of sorts against Trump's worst instincts in diplomacy and foreign policy.\n\nTrump tired of Tillerson first. Once enthralled by Tillerson's time spent as a titan of industry (he was the CEO of ExxonMobil), Trump came to view Tillerson as someone who didn't understand that his job was to execute the vision of the chief executive -- period.\n\nAnd Tillerson, too, was stunned at Trump's seeming lack of knowledge about not only basic geopolitics but the rule of law. \"So often, the President would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it, and I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can't do it that way. It violates the law',\" Tillerson recounted earlier this mont h.\n\nThen came Kelly's time in the Trump vise. Heralded for his solid work at the Department of Homeland Security, Kelly was brought on as chief of staff last summe r to restore order to a West Wing that was careening out of control due to an unmanaged President. Trump, who once praised Kelly's military background and bearing, soon began to chafe under Kelly's strict policies on who could communicate with the President and what news outlets the President was allowed to consume.\n\nDespite all of that -- losing his two most reliable and relied-upon confidants in the Cabinet -- Mattis seemed to skate above it all. He was rarely part of any drama involving Trump. He simply did his duty to the best of his ability. And for a while, it seemed as though Mattis would be the lone survivor of the Big Three from the early days of the administration.\n\nThat ended Thursday -- with the letter that seemed to be months of pent-up frustrations by Mattis loosed, in written form, on Trump.\n\nWith Tillerson gone and Mattis and Kelly on their way out, the prevailing sentiment among establishment Republicans in Washington was one of thinly veiled panic.\n\n\"We are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances & empower our adversaries,\" tweeted Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R) shortly after the news of Mattis' resignation broke.\n\nNebraska Sen. Ben Sasse (R) called it a \"sad day,\" adding: \"Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear. Mattis rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home.\"\n\nThe simple fact of Trump's presidency is now this: All rails have been removed from the proverbial road. The men (and women) expected to mediate and mitigate some of Trump's wilder ideas and statements are now, almost to a person, gone -- driven off by a President whose vision of the country and the world is both highly erratic and deeply held. And almost to a person, those advisers have been replaced by others who have risen up in Trump's reckoning by telling him what he wants to hear.\n\nMattis' departure is the death knell of the idea that Trump could --and possibly would -- adhere to any sort of \"normal\" order during his term as President. This is a President who has driven away the very people who he (and the country) trusted with guiding him as a political leader in these difficult. Now there is only Trump -- and those willing to enable him."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "House passes spending bill with $5 billion for Trump's border wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/_5TeJbwtB60/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) With Washington a little more than 24 hours away from a partial government shutdown, the House of Representatives on Thursday passed a spending bill that includes an additional $5 billion for President Donald Trump's long-promised border wall. The vote was 217-185.\n\nThe $5 billion is in line with what the President has requested of Congress, but passage of the measure significantly raises the chances that the government will at least partially shut down at the end of the week.\n\nThat's because the bill next heads to the Senate, where it is expected to be dead on arrival due to opposition over the border wall money.\n\nDemocrats have already made clear they will not support $5 billion for the wall, and any spending measure would need bipartisan support to pass in the Senate.\n\nLate Thursday night, Trump tweeted: \"Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!\"\n\nMinutes later, he added: \"Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn't have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!\"\n\nThe question now is whether a partial shutdown can still be averted. Funding will expire for several key government agencies at midnight on Friday. If the deadline is not extended, those agencies will shutter just days before Christmas.\n\nJust a day ago, lawmakers had appeared on track to stave off a shutdown after the Senate passed its stopgap funding bill with top congressional Republicans signaling that they expected the President to sign the measure.\n\nBut the outlook changed drastically on Thursday as Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric and suggested again that he is not willing to accept anything less than his $5 billion demand.\n\nHouse GOP leaders had emerged from a meeting with the President at the White House earlier in the day saying that Trump had told them he would not accept the stopgap measure passed by the Senate, which did not include the border wall funding he wanted.\n\nThat news threw many lawmakers into a tailspin as confusion and uncertainty over what would happen next dominated the day on Capitol Hill.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN earlier in the day on Thursday that state of play on the spending bill is \"very fluid right now.\"\n\nThe bill the House took up on Thursday includes $7.81 billion in disaster funds through the rest of the fiscal year in the aftermath of widespread wildfires and Hurricanes Michael and Florence in addition to $5 billion in new money for the border wall for the rest of the fiscal year but to remain available until September 30, 2023.\n\nIt is widely expected that the measure will be unable to pass in the Senate, however, given its allocation for border wall funding.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposal that passed the Senate the day before had the backing of the top congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and top congressional Republicans had indicated on Wednesday they were optimistic that the President would sign the measure.\n\nPelosi, however, argued during a press conference on Thursday that the situation was descending into a \"meltdown\" among Republicans. While she expressed openness to additional funds for issues like disaster aid, she said wall funding would be a dealbreaker for Democrats.\n\n\"We'll see what they come up with in terms of disaster assistance, we'll see. But in terms of wall funding, that's a non-starter.\"\n\nA House GOP conference meeting earlier in the day was a \"strong rebuke\" against the short-term spending bill passed by the Senate, according to North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Walker. \"There wasn't any ambiguity in the room today,\" Walker told CNN.\n\n\"We've got to stay here and get this job done and get border security passed,\" Walker said. \"The Senate's voice vote on the CR was strongly rejected by the conference this morning.\"\n\nThe North Carolina Republican said one member who hadn't spoken in the conference in eight years stood up to speak Thursday and that Rep. Virginia Foxx's husband called her from back home to say you've got to get the wall done. \"It wasn't just one group or one caucus; It was across the board,\" Walker said.\n\n\"There's a lot of frustration,\" said Rep. Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon.\n\nThe Senate-passed measure faces opposition from a broad group of conservatives. Members of the House Freedom Caucus and other conservative allies of the President spoke on the House floor Wednesday night, urging Trump not to abandon new money for border wall funding.\n\nJordan, speaking on the floor, blasted the idea of postponing another spending bill fight to February, when Democrats will hold the majority in the House.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me, really? I mean February 8th? When Nancy Pelosi is speaker? I'm supposed to believe, we're supposed to believe that we're then going to build the border security wall and keep our promise from the 2016 campaign?

The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve.

The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year.

When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report. That encourages me,\" Randall said.\n\n\"Now, if we focus our attention to other lifestyle choices -- like physical inactivity, like obesity -- and find out as individuals what motivates us, what are the small changes that we can make that we'll stick with,\" she said.\n\n\"Whatever that is -- whether that's wearing something that's tracking your activity and it's encouraging you to just add a little bit more walking in your daily life; whether it is having a buddy who you're going to get up and take the dog for a walk together with -- whatever that is that's going to motivate you, it's going to be something that can help you stick with it.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Infections put 12 people in hospitals after they received unapproved stem cell products", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pQk6IZ7f8A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Twelve people in three states developed infections and were hospitalized after they got infusions or injections of stem cell products derived from umbilical cord blood that were contaminated with bacteria, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe patients in Arizona, Florida and Texas received stem cell products processed by Genetech Inc. and distributed by Liveyon LLC, the report says, adding that the products are not FDA-approved or lawfully marketed.\n\nThe FDA sent a warning letter to San Diego-based Genetech in November about ReGen5, ReGen10 and ReGen30 for allogeneic use. The agency issued a statement about it Thursday and said it was sending letters to 20 other providers of stem cell treatments, reminding them of the agency's rules about regenerative medicine.\n\n\"We see a lot of promise from stem cell treatments, but we also have a lot of concern, and we started by sending these 20 letters singling out these firms that should be engaging with FDA but haven't been,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said.\n\n\"In addition, we are also stepping up our inspections this year. We are concerned that there are firms whose actions could be putting patients at risk and might be subject to additional action.\"\n\nThe only FDA-approved use for these umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products is for hematopoietic or immunologic reconstitution, meaning for people with disorders that affect the part of the system involved in producing blood, the hematopoietic system. That can be for blood or bone marrow transplants in patients who have cancer or blood or immune system disorders.\n\nSome practitioners believe that stem cells can \"sense the environment into which they are introduced and address whatever functions require replacement or repair,\" FDA scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2017, but that \"is not based on scientific evidence.\" These stem cell treatments need to go through the appropriate clinical trials to prove that they work and are safe.\n\nThe FDA warned the public about the unapproved use of stem cell treatments in 2017, saying \"unscrupulous providers\" may promise that stem cells can be \"miracle treatments\" for just about any disease or medical condition, but not to believe \"the hype.\" At the time, Gottlieb called them \"dangerously dubious products.\"\n\nThe patients infected in this outbreak got the stem cell treatments for ailments that include general pain, osteoarthritis, back pain, a rotator cuff tear with a cyst and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAccording to Thursday's CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the first infections were reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services on September 17. Three people who got injections or infusions of umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell products at a Texas outpatient clinic on September 12 developed bloodstream infections.\n\nOn September 22, the Florida Department of Health was notified that four people had joint infections after getting injections from a Florida orthopedic clinic between February 15 and August 30. When scientists looked at some of the unopened products at that clinic, they found E. coli and E. faecalis bacteria.\n\nThe report does not offer details on the patient in Arizona. Dr. Kiran Perkins with the CDC's Outbreak and Response Team, who co-authored Thursday's report, said there is some lab work pending in the Arizona case.\n\n\"That clinic didn't have any of the product left,\" Perkins said. \"That is part of the challenge of this investigation: A lot of the clinics don't have any of the product left.\"\n\nPerkins added that the CDC is concerned about the severity of these infections, as all the patients mentioned in the report were hospitalized. \"This particular outbreak has the potential for serious health risks and concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe distributor, Liveyon, issued a national recall of Regen series products in October and suspended shipment of all product pending the outcome of the FDA investigation, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC believes that the bacterial contamination of the stem cell-derived products occurred before distribution. An investigation is taking a closer look at the manufacturing practices and at the safety practices at the clinics to determine whether there was proper infection control.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that an inspection of the Genetech manufacturing facility in June found \"significant deviations\" that included \"deficient donor eligibility practices; unvalidated manufacturing processes; uncontrolled environment; lack of control over the components used in production and a lack of defined areas or a control system to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\"\n\nThe CDC noted that stem cell clinics typically work in an outpatient setting, \"which often have less robust oversight of infection control measures,\" and that's in part why the FDA recommends that patients avoid getting these treatments outside controlled clinical studies that will ensure that the appropriate manufacturing and safety reporting procedures were followed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC is still trying to determine whether other patients received the tainted product. Perkins credited the health departments in Texas and Florida with picking up on infections quickly.\n\nThe FDA urges health care professionals and consumers to report any adverse events related to treatments with Liveyon products, Genetech products or other stem cell treatments to its MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.\n\nGottlieb noted that the field is growing quickly. There's a lot of innovation and promise, and some companies have come in to work with the FDA, but others have \"ignored our request for dialogue,\" he said, and are \"putting patients at risk.\"\n\nHe said Thursday that dozens of firms are not taking the necessary steps to ensure patient safety."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Are you heavier or shorter than the average American?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/gaw78zQsXZ4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) America is struggling with an obesity epidemic , and a new government report says that the population is only getting heavier.\n\n\"Mean (or average) weight, waist circumference, and BMI in adults 20 years and older increased between 1999-2000 and 2015-2016,\" Cynthia Ogden, one of the report's authors and an epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, wrote in an email.\n\nThe report looked at the height, weight, body-mass index and waist circumference of American adults; it updated a 2004 report on these trends between 1960 and 2002.\n\nIn that previous study period, \"mean (or average) weight increased by more than 24 pounds and mean height increased by [about] 1 inch,\" Ogden said.\n\nThe new report shows the trend continuing in weight but not in height.\n\nThe average weight of American men in 2015-16 was 197.9 pounds; for women, it was 170.6 pounds.

Of those surveyed, 18.6% said they've done so.\n\nThat's an increase from 14.3% of women from 2011 to 2015.\n\nBut that number is very much tied to age. Nearly 2 in 5 women ages 40 to 49, or more than 39%, relied on their sterilization for contraception. For women 30 to 39, the figure was about 1 in 5, or more than 21.5%. And for women 20 to 29, only 1 in 20, or about 4%, had had a tubal ligation.\n\n\"Sterilization has been a common form of contraception both due to its permanence and ability to have it done after delivery of a child when someone is already getting health care,\" Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist and board member for the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, wrote in an email. \"Many poor women may not have access to contraception outside of a childbirth (where emergency insurance is often obtainable) so may want something convenient and long lasting.\"\n\nThe pill\n\nThe second most common contraceptive method was the birth control pill. About 12.6% of women reported relying on the pill as contraception.\n\nThat's a decrease from 15.9% from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe new report found that the pill, as it's known, was most popular among women 20 to 29 (19.5%), followed by those 15 to 19 (16.6%) and then 30 to 39 (11%), followed by only slightly more than 5% of women 40 to 49.\n\n\"The pill and permanent sterilization for women have been the most common method of contraception since 1982, according to the Guttmacher institute,\" wrote Dr. Lillian Schapiro, an Atlanta gynecologist in private practice, in an email.\n\nLong-acting contraception\n\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives, including intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, were used by 10.3% of respondents, making them the third most common method.\n\nThis is an increase from 2011 to 2015, when they were used by 8% of those surveyed.\n\nThe new report found use was highest for women ages 20 to 29 (13.1%), followed by those 30 to 39 (11.7%). More than 8% of respondents 15 to 19 used these methods, while less than 7% of women 40 to 49 did.\n\n\"LARC's are very safe now and becoming much more accepted,\" Schapiro wrote. \"For women not ready to permanently prevent pregnancy they are a great option since they don't require remembering a pill every day and keeping up to date on a prescription.\"\n\nMale condoms\n\nMale condoms were the fourth most common method, used by 8.7% of those surveyed.\n\nThat's a decline from 9.2% of respondents reporting use from 2011 to 2015.\n\nNow, women 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 used condoms the most: 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively. Just more than 5% of respondents 15 to 19 and 40 to 49 relied on condoms for contraception.\n\nOther methods\n\nMale sterilization, or vasectomies, was relied on by 5.9% of women. That's an increase from 4.5% of those surveyed from 2011 to 2015.\n\nDepo-Provera (a birth control shot), the contraceptive ring or the patch accounted for 3.2% of used methods. And all other methods were used with 5.6% of women.\n\n\"The pill and sterilization are our oldest forms of birth control and women are more familiar with them, so many women use what they are familiar with. However, as newer devices come unto the market and become popular, that may change,\" Brandi said.\n\nThe new report found that contraceptive use went up with age, with 37.2% of women 15 to 19, 61.9% of those 20 to 29, 72% of women 30 to 39 and 73.7% of women 40 to 49 using contraception.\n\nContraceptive pill use was highest among non-Hispanic white women (14.9%); 9.2% of Hispanic women and 8.3% of non-Hispanic black women reported relying on the pill.\n\nCondom use and long-acting reversible contraceptive use, across racial backgrounds, did not differ with any significance.\n\nEducation levels also made a difference in what methods women used. The higher the level of education, the less likely a woman was to rely on sterilization. Of women who were sterilized, 41.9% had no high school diploma or GED, 32.1% had a high school diploma or GED, 23.7% had some college education, and 11.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nConversely, use of the pill went up according to education levels. Of those who relied on contraceptive pills, 4.9% had no high school degree or GED, 7% had a high school degree or GED, 10.1% had some college, and 16.3% had a bachelor's degree or more.\n\n\"It is important to understand what certain demographics are using so we understand their preferences and make sure that everyone has access to all forms of contraception,\" Brandi noted.\n\nThe 35% of women who were not using contraception when they were interviewed were either not sexually active (17%), were pregnant, were postpartum or were looking to get pregnant (7.5%), nonusers of contraception who'd been sexually active (7.9%) or nonusers for other reasons, like nonsurgical sterility (2.7%)."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-46643173", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright PA Image caption Flights were brought to a standstill after drones were seen over the airfield on Wednesday and Thursday\n\nGatwick's runway has reopened after drones caused the airport to shut down for more than a day.\n\nThe airport said 765 flights were scheduled for departure and arrival.\n\nChief executive officer Chris Woodroofe told the BBC police had not yet found the operator of the drones.

accused the food industry of \"failing the public\" and is calling for taxes on unhealthy food high in sugar and salt.\n\nChief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds.\n\nIn her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food.\n\nThe food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour.\n\nDame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier.\n\nThis means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said.\n\nBased on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Parents would be surprised what is contained in baby food jars, Dame Sally said\n\nDame Sally said \"industry had not delivered\" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more.\n\n\"Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,\" her report says.\n\nShe hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.\n\nBut she recognised this was \"a dream\".\n\nThe report recommends:\n\nextending the tax on sugary drinks to sweetened milk-based drinks\n\na ban on added sugar and salt in jars of baby and infant food\n\nmore ambitious targets for salt reduction in food (to 7g a day), saying progress had stalled since 2011\n\ntaxing foods high in sugar and salt, as a start\n\nincentives to get people eating more fruit and vegetables\n\nAnd it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities.\n\nDame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer.\n\nShe said she would be accused of being \"chief nanny\" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dame Sally hinted that she would like to see taxes from unhealthy foods subsidise fruit and vegetables, but acknowledged this was a \"dream\"\n\n\"We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,\" Dame Sally said.\n\n\"It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school.\"\n\nThe report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made.\n\n'Wrong-headed legislation'\n\nA spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry \"fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes\".\n\nKate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade.\n\nBut she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight.\n\n\"Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.\n\n\"It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined.\"\n\nAnd she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour.\n\n\"Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced \u00a33.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health

She said it was imperative that MPs \"find a way of getting a deal through Parliament\".\n\nTo that end, she said she backed the idea of testing the will of Parliament through a series of \"indicative\" votes on \"Plan B\" options should MPs reject the PM's agreement.\n\n\"It would flush out where... the majority is,\" she said. \"So people who hold on to the idea of one option or another would see there is no majority and so they will need to move to their next preference.\n\n\"We will hopefully be able to find where the compromise and the consensus is.\"\n\nSpeaking on the

And experts say they do see waits increasing.\n\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"This is a real problem. It's something we predicted. Unfortunately, it's the inevitable consequence of a shortage of GPs.\"\n\nA 2016 Lancet paper said GPs' workload had risen by 16% in the seven years up to 2014, with more frequent and longer GP consultations.\n\nIs it because demands on GPs have increased?\n\nFactors including an ageing population and an increasing number of people with complex medical needs mean the standard appointment often isn't long enough.\n\nDr Kamal Mahtani, a GP and an associate professor in primary care at the University of Oxford, said: \"You've got 10 minutes to talk about their diabetes, their high blood pressure, their mood and look at the patient more holistically.\n\n\"So a GP might end up having to say, 'We've dealt with X and Y today but I'll need to see you again.'

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2014 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km). New Horizons is currently at 44 AU and clocking about three additional AU every year.\n\nIts power system could probably run to about 100 AU, said Prof Stern.\n\n\"That's less than the Voyagers' distance but the interesting game is that the heliosphere breathes in and out by tens of astronomical units because of the solar cycle,\" he explained.\n\n\"No-one is good enough at predicting the solar cycle to tell you where the edge of the heliosphere will be in the mid-late 2030s when we go power-critical.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa hack exposes space agency staff's data", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46622467", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Nasa said employees who had worked for the agency since 2006 were at risk\n\nNasa has emailed its staff to warn them that hackers may have stolen their personal details.\n\nThe message said it suspected that two of its servers containing details of past and present employees had been compromised.\n\nIt added that it did not believe any Nasa mission had been put in jeopardy.\n\nOne expert noted that this was the latest in a series of breaches experienced by the space agency to have been made public since 2011.\n\nIn this case, the memo involved was published by the SpaceRef news site.\n\nIt said that a probe into the incidents had been ongoing since 23 October.\n\n\"Our entire leadership team takes the protection of personal information very seriously,\" it said.\n\n\"Nasa is continuing its efforts to secure all servers, and is reviewing its processes and procedures to ensure that the latest security practices are being followed throughout the agency.\"\n\nThe email added that social security numbers and other private information belonging to civil service employees of the agency who had worked for it since July 2006, might have been affected.\n\nPrevious attacks include an incident in which hackers took control of computers in Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2011, and an attack in 2013 that led to eight Nasa web domains being defaced by a gang calling itself the Master Italian Hackers Team.\n\n\"The public want to know that this government agency is learning from the past, we want the post-mortem,\" commented Sam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason.\n\n\"There are many things at Nasa in the national security domain which are of vital importance.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Radiohead, Janet Jackson Inducted Into Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/radiohead-janet-jackson-inducted-into-rock-roll-hall-1831242627", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame will induct a 2019 class including Radiohead, Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks, The Cure, The Zombies, and several others.

After two days of deliberations, some 150 nations signed the Global Compact for Migration (GCM) agreement, which called for the implementation of more humane policies to ensure \"safe, orderly and regular migration\".\n\nBut the conference and the agreement were very much a platform for Western doublespeak and hypocrisy. European countries and the United States are by far not concerned with the \"safety\" of migrants and refugees heading for their borders.\n\nIn fact, the border security industry in Europe and the US is thriving and in both places, Israel with its infamous militarised security policies is serving as a role model and a major technology supplier. It is therefore no surprise that European and US border control mechanisms are increasingly becoming as brutal and inhumane as Israel's.\n\nIn the case of Europe, it makes no difference that some of its leaders have made meek attempts at criticising Israel's use of disproportionate force against Palestinians and its devastating siege on Gaza, which has been in place for almost 12 years. All the same, Europe is increasingly becoming one of the main markets for Israeli war and security technology - the same one tried, tested and used against Palestinians and migrants and refugees trying to reach Israeli borders.\n\nIn fact, Europe, and especially its rising far-right powers, have increasingly adopted Israel's way of dealing with \"inconvenient\" populations.\n\nShared racism\n\n\"We have a duty to protect our borders against illegal infiltrators,\" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recent statement to the press. \"That's what we've done, and that's what we will continue to do.\"\n\nIt is common knowledge that Israel is a state that discriminates against the indigenous Palestinian population based on race and religion. In recent years, a flow of African migrants and refugees, who try to seek asylum in Israel through the Sinai border, has added yet a new component to Israeli racism, one that is based on colour.\n\nIn March this year, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel called black people \"monkeys\", using the Hebrew equivalent of the \"n-word\" during his weekly sermon. Netanyahu, along with other Israeli officials, has joined the racist tirade on many occasions. \"The 'flood' of migrants from Africa is 'much worse' than acts of terrorism emanating from Sinai,\" he said.\n\nThis racist discourse is increasingly finding its match among the European far right.\n\n\"La pacchia e' finita!\" (The party is over) is a recurring slogan used by Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini to convey the totally misleading notion that sees refugees as people who want to \"live off\" the Italian people. Members of Salvini's La Lega party have repeatedly and shamelessly dubbed Italy's first African-Italian minister, Cecile Kienge a \"monkey\", and \"prostitute\", horrific words in an ever-growing racist vocabulary used by the country's far-right parties.\n\nIt was no surprise, then, to find Salvini, the rising star of what can be considered Italy's neo-fascist movement, a welcome guest in Israel.\n\nIn his first visit to Tel Aviv in March 2016, where he attempted to whitewash his reputation of racism and anti-Semitism - which has been historically associated with Italy's far right - Salvini commended Israel as \"the perfect balance of different realities, while ensuring law and order. It surely is a role model for security and anti-terrorism policies.\"\n\nIn June this year, Salvini became Italy's new interior minister and, arguably, the most powerful politician in the country. Thus, when he returned to Israel earlier this month, his \"friendship\" with Netanyahu was a source of pride for both of them.\n\nHis trip to Israel came right after the Marrakesh conference, where both countries also joined efforts to resist policies that work towards \"safe\" and dignified migration.\n\nThe Israeli government did not miss the opportunity to show off its border security to Salvini. He was taken on a tour of the border with Lebanon, where - according to his tweet - \"Islamic terrorists are digging tunnels and setting up missiles to attack Israel\".\n\nThe tour was no coincidence. Italy is one of several European countries that are keenly interested in Israel's border security technologies and strategies and are pushing for their adoption on the European Union level.\n\nIsrael and Europe's border security craze\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX) has been at the forefront of employing military technology for civilian purposes, despite the obvious implications of such a policy on the erosion of civil liberties and fundamental human rights.\n\nUnfortunately, the European debate on this issue has been settled in favour of the \"security\" enthusiasts. Just a few years ago, the discussion on the possibility of using drones to control migration and refugee routes took centre-stage in European media and political circles.\n\nAt the time, many argued that such technology could infringe on fundamental rights, such as privacy, right to seek asylum - which is protected under international law - freedom of movement, and so on.\n\nToday, the deployment of military drones is a matter of course, as the national security discourse has prevailed in the public sphere, thanks to fear-mongering and divisive politics.\n\nIn 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated at between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn). Today, this market is estimated to reach 50 billion euros globally ($57bn) by 2022, a large chunk of it being claimed by European spending.\n\nIsrael, as a country well-versed in manipulating the term \"security\", is poised to benefit immensely from this development. It is already skillfully exploiting the security-obsessed European mindset in order to expand its military market outreach.\n\nIsrael is the seventh largest arms exporter in the world, and is emerging as a leader in the global export of aerial drones.\n\nThe Israeli brand is particularly popular because its technology is \"combat-proven\". Indeed, the Israeli military has had ample opportunity to test its diverse weapons and security cache against Palestinian civilians.\n\nBuying security technology tested on Palestinians\n\nEarlier this year, Israeli military company Elbit won a two-year $68m contract with the EU to provide maritime unmanned aircraft system (UAS) services. It will deploy and operate its Hermes 900 Maritime Patrol system, the same one which was used during the bloody Israeli assault on Gaza in 2014. The Israeli military praised the UAS as \"phenomenal\" and \"a real asset\" in the war, which killed 2,250 Palestinians, including more than 500 children.\n\nFRONTEX has already contracted the Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) for the use of its Airbus Maritime Heron Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) in daily security and coastal guard missions. This technology was also used in Israel's assault on Gaza in 2014. FRONTEX is paying IAI 4.75 million euro ($5.57m). It has also concluded a contract with Italian part-state-owned defence company Leonardo (formerly Finmeccanica) for its Falco technology for 1.7 million euro ($2m).\n\nIt is ironic - and quite telling - that these companies that are feeding weapons to the Middle East and its conflicts are the same ones that are earning massive income from selling technologies used to stave off people fleeing these same conflicts.\n\nWhile such businesses are aiding the systematic destruction of entire Middle Eastern countries, they are also contributing towards the increasingly popular idea that \"Fortress Europe\" needs militarised protection.\n\nWhat is enabling the Israeli-EU cooperation and empowering Israel as \"Europe's protector\" is the congruence between the far-right pro-Israel political discourse and the far-right populist movements that are plaguing Europe.\n\nOn December 16, just days following the Morocco conference on migration, thousands of far-right activists protested in Brussels against the GCM. The protest, named the \"March against Marrakesh\", turned violent as angry anti-refugee protesters clashed with police.\n\nAlas, the Brussels clashes represent the new face of Europe: intolerant, gripped by fear and vulnerable to racist and far-right ideas.\n\nWhile the new political environment will not bode well for Europe's future, it is a reality that suits Israel only too well, not only because it is consistent with its anti-migrant, anti-Muslim agenda, but also because it is a splendid opportunity to expand the market of its \"combat-tested\" weapons.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Czech coal mine blast toll rises to 13", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/czech-coal-blast-toll-rises-13-181221065913801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "A methane explosion in a Czech coal mine has killed 13 miners, including 11 Polish nationals and two Czechs, the mine operator OKD said on Friday.\n\nThe state-run OKD company said a methane blast more than 800 metres (875 yards) underground devastated areas of the CSM hard-coal mine, near the town of Karvina, on Thursday.\n\n\"Due to yesterday's mine disaster, 13 miners lost their lives - 11 Poles and two Czechs,\" OKD spokesman Ivo Celechovsky said at a televised news conference.\n\nThe incident is the worst mining accident in the Czech Republic since 1990, when 30 miners died in a fire at a mine near Karvina, according to a list compiled by the CTK news agency.\n\nOKD said most of the victims and injured were Polish miners provided by the ALPEX company.\n\nOKD managing director Boleslav Kowalczyk said the search of the scene had had to be abandoned due to conditions in the shaft.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have reached a point where it was impossible to move forward, because there was a fire raging and zero visibility,\" he said."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "UK's Gatwick airport resumes flights after drone chaos", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/uk-gatwick-airport-resumes-flights-drone-chaos-181221070111304.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:20", "body_paragraphs": "Britain's Gatwick airport has reopened after a rogue drone saboteur wrought travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of Christmas travellers by playing cat-and-mouse with police snipers and the army.\n\nAfter the biggest disruption at Gatwick, Britain's second busiest, since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010, Gatwick said on riday its runway was open and that a limited number of aircraft were scheduled for departure and arrival.\n\n\"Gatwick's runway is currently available and a limited number of aircraft are scheduled for departure and arrival,\" the airport said.\n\n\"Gatwick continues to advise passengers to check the status of their flight with their airline before travelling to the airport as departures and arrivals will be subject to delays and cancellations.\"\n\nGatwick said 700 planes were due to take off on Friday, although there would still be delays and cancellations.\n\nBritain deployed unidentified military technology to guard the airport against what the UK's Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said were thought to be several drones.\n\n\"What's happening on the ground is a mix of measures taken to give confidence that aircraft can be safe...

That is an average of about 20 soldiers killed every day.\n\nThe surge in violence comes as the United States is pushing for a peaceful resolution to the 17-year-old conflict, while the Taliban has increasingly asserted control over vast tracts of the country.\n\nTrump privately has been complaining about US military involvement in Afghanistan, telling an ally as recently as Wednesday words to the effect of, \"What are we doing there? We've been there all these years.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, often a vocal Trump ally, warned of possible danger to the United States if the drawdown goes through.\n\n\"The conditions in Afghanistan - at the present moment - make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Bush announced the first strikes in Afghanistan one month after the terrorist attacks on America on Sept. 11, 2001. An international coalition launched the attack with the aim of toppling the ultraconservative regime of the Taliban that had provided sanctuary to the terrorist group al-Qaida, which was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The coalition consisted of 136 countries around the world.\n\nThe duration:\n\nThe war is still ongoing, 17 years after it began. In June 2010, it surpassed the Vietnam War as the longest war in U.S. history. Three presidential administrations have overseen the war, that of Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. troop deployment:\n\nThere are about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the end of 2018, but about half of them are logisticians or trainers. When President Barack Obama took office, there were about 30,000 troops there. His surge more than tripled that number to more than 100,000 in 2011. In 2012, Obama began a draw-down which left about 8,500 troops at the end of his second term in 2016. President Donald Trump boosted the numbers to more than 14,000.\n\nCosts of war\n\nMore than 2,400 U.S. troops have died in the Afghan War since 2001. The deadliest year was 2010, with 499 American casualties and a total coalition loss of 711 lives. According to the United Nations, tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have also been killed since the war began. The first six months of 2018 were the deadliest since 2009, when the U.N. started keeping record of civilian casualties, with 1,692 deaths. Another 3,430 civilians were injured in the same period.\n\nThe Pentagon said in February that the war was costing the American people $45 billion per year, including $5 billion for Afghan forces, $13 billion for U.S. forces inside Afghanistan, some $780 million for economic aid and much of the rest for logistical support.

But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement. And drug trials toward the end of the West Africa outbreak produced evidence about the vaccine that\u2019s now being deployed.\n\nBut pregnant women weren\u2019t included in those trials, and researchers collected little in the way of data about the burden pregnant women and their offspring face.\n\n\u201cPregnant women are continuously getting left out of the benefits of scientific advancement in medicine,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to fail to collect the kinds of data that we need, to generate the kind of evidence that we need and to also have interventions that meet the broader population\u2019s needs,\u201d Krubiner said, \u201cthen we\u2019re just going to continue to perpetuate the cycle.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Yemeni Mother Holds Dying Baby in California Hospital", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/yemeni-mother-holds-dying-baby-in-california-hospital/4710351.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "A mother from Yemen cradled her dying infant son in a California hospital Thursday when, just a few days ago, she thought she would never be able to tell him goodbye.\n\nThe State Department granted Shaima Swileh a waiver to President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban, allowing her to hold her baby and tell him how much she loves him, perhaps for the last time.\n\nFriends and reporters mobbed Swileh when she arrived at the San Francisco airport Wednesday night.\n\nHusband, son US citizens\n\nTwo-year-old Abdullah Hassan, a U.S. citizen, is on life support with a rare genetic brain condition.

McKesson shipped an average of 9,650 hydrocodone pills per day in 2007 to a now-closed pharmacy in Kermit, which has a population of about 400. The shipments were 36 times above a monthly dosage shipment threshold the company had established that year.\n\nCompliance questions\n\nThe Charleston Gazette-Mail previously cited federal records that showed drug wholesalers shipped 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to West Virginia from 2007 to 2012, a period when 1,728 people fatally overdosed on the painkillers. Gazette-Mail reporter Eric Eyre won a Pulitzer Prize last year for investigative reporting on the subject.\n\nThe committee report calls the shipments \u201ctroubling\u201d and said it raises serious questions about compliance with the DEA-administered Controlled Substances Act. Until at least 2010, the DEA didn\u2019t proactively review usage data to combat the diversion of drugs for illicit purposes, the report said.\n\nDrug distributors are required to submit suspicious orders to the DEA, which \u201cstill does not have a centralized way to analyze suspicious order reports submitted by drug distributors,\u201d the report said. Instead, suspicious orders are typically reported to local DEA offices, resulting in inconsistent handling under varying regulatory interpretations.\n\n\u201cAs the country continues to feel the effects of the opioid crisis, neither distributors nor the DEA can shirk their oversight responsibilities,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u200bAdditional rules urged\n\nThe report suggests pharmacies with suspicious orders should be subjected to heightened monitoring, Congress should enact additional requirements on suspicious pill orders to clarify database registrant responsibilities, and the DEA should work to provide more real-time data to registrants.\n\nEarlier this year the DEA approved a rule change requiring drugmakers to identify a legitimate need for opioids to justify their production in an attempt to rein in their diversion for abuse.\n\nMore than 351,000 people have died of opioid overdoses in the United States since 1999, and far more people die each year from opioid misuse than from traffic accidents or violence, the report said.\n\n\u201cThis investigation is a start to establish some accountability and understanding about the epidemic, but this inquiry is only a look at a piece of the overall puzzle,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere are other actors involved in the epidemic including manufacturers, pharmacies, physicians, and drug traffickers.\u201d\n\nCompany statements\n\nChesterbrook, Pennsylvania-based AmerisourceBergen said in a statement it has proactively enacted many of the report\u2019s recommendations but has \u201cvirtually no interaction with physicians and limited legal ability to gather information on their practices and prescribing behavior.\u201d\n\nDublin, Ohio-based Cardinal Health said it would \u201ccontinue to implement rigorous anti-diversion controls.\u201d A company statement said it is an intermediary in the pharmaceutical supply chain that \u201cplays a limited but vital role.\u201d\n\nThe DEA and San Francisco-based McKesson Corp. didn\u2019t immediate respond to requests for comment."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "China \u2018Resolutely Opposes\u2019 New US Law on Tibet", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/china-resolutely-opposes-new-us-law-on-tibet/4710398.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "China denounced the United States on Thursday for passing a new law on restive Tibet, saying it was \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to the U.S. legislation on what China considers an internal affair, and it risked causing \u201cserious harm\u201d to their relations.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed into law the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act.\n\nThe law seeks to promote access to Tibet for U.S. diplomats and other officials, journalists and other citizens by denying U.S. entry for Chinese officials deemed responsible for restricting access to Tibet.\n\nBeijing sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.\n\nChina: wrong signals\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing that the law \u201csent seriously wrong signals to Tibetan separatist elements,\u201d as well as threatening to worsen bilateral ties strained by trade tension and other issues.\n\n\u201cIf the United States implements this law, it will cause serious harm to China-U.S. relations and to the cooperation in important areas between the two countries,\u201d Hua said.\n\nThe United States should be fully aware of the high sensitivity of the Tibet issue and should stop its interference, otherwise the United States would have to accept responsibility for the consequences, she added, without elaborating.\n\nDifficult life in Tibet\n\nRights groups say the situation for ethnic Tibetans inside what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region remains extremely difficult.

The probe is looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nThe investigation had been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until Trump ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general last month and appointed Whitaker. The senior official said Rosenstein continues to have day-to-day oversight of the probe.\n\nAdvisory group\n\n\n\nThe official said that after Whitaker was appointed, he formed a group of four Justice Department officials \u2014 led by a veteran U.S. attorney \u2014 to advise him on the transition and ethics process. That small group of officials met repeatedly with the Justice Department's career ethics officials.\n\n\n\nWhitaker met with the ethics officials three times in the last six weeks, the senior official said. During one of those meetings, the officials asked Whitaker about the comments he made as a legal commentator for CNN about his views of the Mueller investigation. The remarks were made before he joined the Justice Department.\n\n\n\nWhitaker had once opined about a scenario in which Trump could fire Sessions and then appoint an acting attorney general who could stifle the funding of Mueller's probe. His other past public statements have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump's family finances. In a talk-radio interview, Whitaker maintained there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nWhitaker was not required to solicit a recommendation from ethics officials, and the decision about whether he should recuse was up to him, the senior official said.\n\nSince taking office, Whitaker has not been briefed on specific developments of the special counsel's investigation and Rosenstein will continue to maintain day-to-day oversight for the foreseeable future, the official added.\n\n\n\nHowever, the official said Whitaker can be briefed as the investigation moves forward, though there isn't a set timetable yet on when that might begin.\n\nNadler plans questions\n\n\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who will take over as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January, said it was \"unacceptable'' that Whitaker didn't inform members of Congress about his decision not to recuse himself and vowed to question Whitaker before the committee.\n\n\"More concerning, at the moment, is the fact that career DOJ ethics officials appear to have had serious concerns about Mr. Whitaker's ability and fitness to oversee the special counsel's investigation,'' Nadler said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department planned to send a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York about Whitaker's recusal decision and the ethics process later Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe question of whether an attorney general can or should recuse from a particular criminal investigation has long been politically fraught, and decisions in both directions have had far-reaching ramifications.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, for instance, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch opted not to recuse herself from the Clinton email investigation despite an impromptu chat with former President Bill Clinton at an airport tarmac in Phoenix. Lynch opted instead to accept the FBI's recommendation on whether to bring charges. Former FBI Director James Comey has acknowledged being frustrated by that decision, and went ahead days later with a controversial news conference at which he announced the FBI's recommendation against charges.\n\n\n\nSessions recused himself from the Russia investigation just days into his job as attorney general. He said it was because of his work as a campaign surrogate for Trump, but the announcement followed explosive revelations of multiple encounters with the Russian ambassador over the last year. Trump never forgave him and ultimately forced him from the job a year and a half later."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Experts Call for Inclusion of Pregnant Women in Vaccine Research", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-call-for-inclusion-of-pregnant-women-in-vaccine-research/4710376.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Pregnant women have been systematically overlooked in the development and deployment of new vaccines, undermining their health and their communities\u2019 safety, according to guidelines released this month by an international team of researchers, scientists and health care providers.\n\nThe report, developed by the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics and New Technologies (PREVENT) working group, identifies a cycle of exclusion that prevents pregnant women from accessing the benefits of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reticence to include pregnant women in research,\u201d said Carleigh Krubiner, the project director and a co-principal investigator for PREVENT.\n\nAnd that\u2019s led to a shortfall in data about how pregnant women respond to vaccines.\n\nKrubiner, an associate faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, told VOA that researchers and health care providers tend to exclude pregnant women from trials, vaccinations and tracking because they lack evidence of the risks expectant mothers face.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have this Catch-22 of not having enough evidence to feel like we can do the research. But if we don\u2019t do the research, we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of fear\u2019\n\nConcerns over \u201ctheoretical harm\u201d drive decisions to exclude pregnant women from interventions, Krubiner said. But the data scientists do have, often from women not known to be pregnant when they received vaccinations, suggest those concerns are overblown.\n\nIn the case of rubella, for example, a contagious viral infection, researchers didn\u2019t find a connection between congenital rubella syndrome and the vaccine when thousands of pregnant women were vaccinated before their pregnancy status was known.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear,\u201d Krubiner said. \u201cAnd there are certainly biologically plausible risks associated with different types of live replicating viral vaccines.\u201d\n\nLive-virus vaccines contain a weakened version of the disease designed to stimulate an immune response in recipients.\n\n\u201cVery often, the benefits of vaccinating do still outweigh the theoretical, or even real harms that may be posed to the fetus,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nOne vaccine known to cause harm to pregnant women and their fetuses, Krubiner added, is for smallpox. But even in that case, she said, if a threat were imminent, pregnant women should get vaccinated, given the seriousness of the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support that guidance.\n\n\u200b\u2018Strongly recommended\u2019\n\nThe advice pregnant women receive about vaccination should reflect what\u2019s known about the particular vaccine and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, Krubiner said.\n\nRecommendations should follow current knowledge about the disease in question, the severity of the threat, and the likelihood of exposure, she added.\n\nBut the general guidance is unambiguous.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, vaccines should be offered to women, and in many cases they should be strongly recommended,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nAmong those cases is the vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu, which pregnant women should be urged to receive, in light of the severity of the risks tied to infection \u2014 not just for the expectant mother, but the future child as well.\n\nPregnant women should also be encouraged to receive vaccines for H1N1, also known as swine flu, and DPT, which protects against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.\n\nInstitutional change\n\nInvolving pregnant women in the benefits of vaccines will require systemic shifts, the PREVENT group said in its report this month.\n\nAn important step is to become more proactive in bringing pregnant women into what Krubiner called the \u201cdevelopment and research pipeline.\u201d By involving pregnant women early, she said, health care providers aren\u2019t left with the kinds of blind spots about how vaccines will affect expectant mothers and their fetuses that lead to their exclusion.\n\nEven basic information, such as pregnancy status in case reports, sometimes goes untracked, despite being easy to collect and providing insight into the unique burden pregnant women face in disease outbreaks.\n\nMore complex data collection will paint a more complete picture. Specific studies could be designed to examine the safety and efficacy of vaccines for pregnant women, for example, or to track effects at different points in gestation.\n\n\u201cStarting anywhere at this point would be better than the dearth of data that we have right now to really try to address the needs of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\nLessons learned\n\nDisease outbreaks devastate communities. But they also provide opportunities to better prepare for, and respond to, the next epidemic.\n\nIn this year\u2019s Ebola outbreaks in Congo, responders have applied lessons from West Africa\u2019s 2014-16 epidemic to community engagement. And drug trials toward the end of the West Africa outbreak produced evidence about the vaccine that\u2019s now being deployed.\n\nBut pregnant women weren\u2019t included in those trials, and researchers collected little in the way of data about the burden pregnant women and their offspring face.\n\n\u201cPregnant women are continuously getting left out of the benefits of scientific advancement in medicine,\u201d Krubiner said.\n\n\u201cIf we continue to fail to collect the kinds of data that we need, to generate the kind of evidence that we need and to also have interventions that meet the broader population\u2019s needs,\u201d Krubiner said, \u201cthen we\u2019re just going to continue to perpetuate the cycle.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Report: Distributors, DEA Failed to Slow US Opioid Crisis", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-distributors-dea-failed-to-slow-us-opioid-crisis/4710332.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "A congressional report on prescription pill dumping in West Virginia blames U.S. prescription drug distributors and the Drug Enforcement Administration for not doing enough to help mitigate the nation\u2019s opioid addiction and overdose crisis.\n\nThe 324-page report released Wednesday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee followed an 18-month investigation and focused on the three largest U.S. wholesale drug companies, McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, and regional distributors.\n\nThe report cited examples of massive pill shipments to West Virginia, which has a population of 1.8 million and has by far the nation\u2019s highest death rate from prescription drugs. McKesson shipped an average of 9,650 hydrocodone pills per day in 2007 to a now-closed pharmacy in Kermit, which has a population of about 400. The shipments were 36 times above a monthly dosage shipment threshold the company had established that year.\n\nCompliance questions\n\nThe Charleston Gazette-Mail previously cited federal records that showed drug wholesalers shipped 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills to West Virginia from 2007 to 2012, a period when 1,728 people fatally overdosed on the painkillers. Gazette-Mail reporter Eric Eyre won a Pulitzer Prize last year for investigative reporting on the subject.\n\nThe committee report calls the shipments \u201ctroubling\u201d and said it raises serious questions about compliance with the DEA-administered Controlled Substances Act. Until at least 2010, the DEA didn\u2019t proactively review usage data to combat the diversion of drugs for illicit purposes, the report said.\n\nDrug distributors are required to submit suspicious orders to the DEA, which \u201cstill does not have a centralized way to analyze suspicious order reports submitted by drug distributors,\u201d the report said. Instead, suspicious orders are typically reported to local DEA offices, resulting in inconsistent handling under varying regulatory interpretations.\n\n\u201cAs the country continues to feel the effects of the opioid crisis, neither distributors nor the DEA can shirk their oversight responsibilities,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u200bAdditional rules urged\n\nThe report suggests pharmacies with suspicious orders should be subjected to heightened monitoring, Congress should enact additional requirements on suspicious pill orders to clarify database registrant responsibilities, and the DEA should work to provide more real-time data to registrants.\n\nEarlier this year the DEA approved a rule change requiring drugmakers to identify a legitimate need for opioids to justify their production in an attempt to rein in their diversion for abuse.\n\nMore than 351,000 people have died of opioid overdoses in the United States since 1999, and far more people die each year from opioid misuse than from traffic accidents or violence, the report said.\n\n\u201cThis investigation is a start to establish some accountability and understanding about the epidemic, but this inquiry is only a look at a piece of the overall puzzle,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere are other actors involved in the epidemic including manufacturers, pharmacies, physicians, and drug traffickers.\u201d\n\nCompany statements\n\nChesterbrook, Pennsylvania-based AmerisourceBergen said in a statement it has proactively enacted many of the report\u2019s recommendations but has \u201cvirtually no interaction with physicians and limited legal ability to gather information on their practices and prescribing behavior.\u201d\n\nDublin, Ohio-based Cardinal Health said it would \u201ccontinue to implement rigorous anti-diversion controls.\u201d A company statement said it is an intermediary in the pharmaceutical supply chain that \u201cplays a limited but vital role.\u201d\n\nThe DEA and San Francisco-based McKesson Corp. didn\u2019t immediate respond to requests for comment."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Vehicles, Guns Are Leading Causes of Death for US Youth", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/vehicles-guns-lead-cause-of-death-in-us-youth/4709843.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Motor vehicles and firearms kill young Americans more than any other cause, like disease, which has significantly declined, according to a new study.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine reports that less than 2 percent (or 20,360) of all U.S. deaths \u2014 including adults \u2014 occur among children and adolescents 1 to 19 years old.\n\n\"By 2016,\" the year for which the most recent data are available, \"death among children and adolescents had become a rare event,\" study authors Dr. Rebecca M. Cunningham, Maureen A. Walton and Dr. Patrick M. Carter of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor wrote in the Dec. 20 edition.\n\nBut in the second largest cause of death among young people \u2014 death by firearms \u2014 the U.S. leads the world.\n\n\"The rate of firearm deaths among children and adolescents was higher in the United States than in all other high-income countries and low-to-middle-income countries with available 2016 data,\" the authors wrote, or 36.5 times as high as 12 other \"high-income\" countries.\n\nData for 2017, which are not included in the NEJM article, show a continued increase in firearm deaths for children and adolescents, Cunningham said.\n\n\"One in three U.S. homes with youth under 18 years of age has a firearm, with 43 percent of homes reporting that the firearm is kept unlocked and loaded, which increases the risk of firearm injuries,\" the authors reported. \"In addition to differences in availability between the United States and other countries, there is wide variability across countries in laws relating to the purchase of firearms, access to them and safe storage.\"\n\nAt the same time, \"early diagnosis, vaccinations, antibiotics, and medical and surgical treatment\" resulted in \"declines in deaths from infectious disease or cancer,\" the report said.\n\nAnd while motor vehicle events were the leading cause of death for young people, that cause has declined 38 percent over the past decade, the authors wrote.\n\nWhat caused the declines?\n\n\"Seat belts and appropriate child safety seats, the production of cars with improved safety standards, better constructed roads, graduated driver licensing programs, and a focus on reducing teen drinking and driving,\" the authors wrote, noting that the decline occurred at the same time as increases in the number of U.S. vehicles and annual vehicle-miles traveled.\n\nBut there's a hitch: Between 2013 and 2016, research showed the decline leveling. And while researchers said they didn't know for certain, they suspected that distracted driving by teenagers, by other teens in a car or by cellphone use, explained the leveling. The report also wondered about marijuana use and drugged driving leading to \"decreased risk perceptions among adolescents.\"\n\nAmong firearm deaths, 59 percent were homicides, 35 percent were suicides, and 4 percent were unintentional injuries such as accidental discharges of firearms, which aligns with incidents among Americans older than 20.\n\nDeath by firearms\n\nAmong the unintentional firearm deaths \u2014 less than 2 percent of all U.S. firearm deaths \u2014 26 percent occurred among children and adolescents, the report said.\n\n\"Malignant neoplasms,\" like cancer, were the third-leading cause of death, representing 9 percent of deaths among children and adolescents. That was followed by suffocation (7 percent) because of \"bed linens, plastic bags, obstruction of the airway, hanging or strangulation.\"\n\nAmong the youngest children, 1 to 4 years-old, drowning in swimming pools, rivers and lakes was the most common cause of death, the report said. Death by drowning was more rare in older children, \"which potentially reflects widespread swim training among school-aged children.\"\n\nAmong youth 10 to 19 years of age, injury deaths from motor vehicle crashes, firearms and suffocation were the three leading causes. Researchers said these causes reflected \"increased risk-taking behavior, differential peer and parental influence, and initiation of substance use.\"\n\nDrug overdoses or poisonings rose to the sixth-leading cause of death among children and adolescents in 2016, the report said, attributed to an increase in \"opioid overdoses, which account for well over half of all drug overdoses among adolescents.\"\n\nMortality was higher among blacks (38.2 per 100,000) and American Indians or Alaska Natives (28.0 per 100,000) than among whites (24.2 per 100,000) and Asians or Pacific Islanders (15.9 per 100,000), the authors wrote. Deaths related to firearms were the leading cause of death among black youth and occurred 3.7 times the rate of such deaths among white youth.\n\nDrowning deaths\n\nBlack youth also had higher rates of drowning deaths (1.6 times as high) and fire-related deaths (2.3 times as high) than white youth. Blacks had death rates from heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases such as asthma that were 2.1 and 6.3 times as high, respectively, as the rates among white youth.\n\n\"Such disparities probably reflect underlying socioeconomic issues, including poverty, environmental exposures and differential access to health care services,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"Progress toward further reducing deaths among children and adolescents will require a shift in public perceptions so that injury deaths are viewed not as 'accidents,' but rather as social ecologic phenomena that are amenable to prevention.\" the authors concluded.\n\nResearchers compiled their report on data from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 57 vital-statistics jurisdictions."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "9 US States Seek to Stop Trump Administration's Atlantic Oil Testing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-states-seek-to-stop-trump-administration-s-atlantic-oil-testing/4709633.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Attorneys general from nine U.S. states sued the Trump administration on Thursday to stop future seismic tests for oil and gas deposits off the East Coast, joining a lawsuit from environmentalists concerned that the tests harm whales and dolphins.\n\nSeismic testing uses air gun blasts to map out what resources lie beneath the ocean.

Jam their signals, others suggested.\n\nExperts say it's not that easy.\n\nBritain and the U.S. prohibit drones from being flown too high or too close to airports and other aircraft. In Britain, it is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nStill, there is little to stop a drone operator bent on disrupting air traffic, which British officials say was the case with the Gatwick incident that began Wednesday evening.\n\nThe number of close calls between drones and aircraft has increased dramatically in recent years as the popularity of drones has soared. Basic models for amateurs sell for under $100; larger, more sophisticated ones can cost hundreds more.\n\nBritain had 120 reports of close encounters in 2018, up from 93 last year. In 2014, there were six, according to the U.K. Airprox Board, which catalogs air safety incidents.\n\nIn the United States, there were nearly 2,300 drone sightings at airports in the year ending June 30, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Runways have been temporarily closed, but an FAA spokesman said he could not recall drones ever leading to the shutdown of a U.S. airport.\n\nDrone dangers\n\nA drone hit a small charter plane in Canada in 2017; it landed safely. In another incident that same year, a drone struck a U.S. Army helicopter in New York but caused only minor damage.\n\n\"This has gone from being what a few years ago what we would have called an emerging threat to a more active threat,\" said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of askthepilot.com. \"The hardware is getting bigger and heavier and potentially more lethal, and so we need a way to control how these devices are used and under what rules.\"\n\nEven small drones could cause severe consequences by damaging a helicopter's rotor or getting sucked into a jet engine. A drone could also crash through a windshield, incapacitating the pilot, though that's mainly seen as a risk to small aircraft.\n\n\"On an airliner, because of the thickness of the glass, I think it's pretty unlikely, unless it's a very large drone,\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant.\n\nDrones that collide with planes could cause more damage than birds of the same size because of their solid motors, batteries and other parts, according to a study released by the FAA.\n\nStopping drones\n\nAuthorities could capture drones with anti-drone \"net guns\" that fire lightweight netting, but such equipment can be pricey and have limited range, and it is not widely used.\n\nAs for taking one down with a rifle, hitting a small, fast-moving object like a drone would be difficult even for a marksman, and the bullet could hit someone, experts say. There's also the risk of damage or injury from a falling drone.\n\nJamming systems could disrupt the signals between drone and operator, but that could interfere with the many vital communication systems in use at an airport, said Marc Wagner, CEO of Switzerland-based Drone Detection Sys.\n\nLocal laws might also prevent the use of such electronic countermeasures. Wagner said it is OK in Switzerland to use jamming systems, while Britain and the U.S. prohibit them.\n\nDutch police experimented with using eagles to swoop down on drones and pluck them out of the sky over airports or large events, but ended the program last year, reportedly because the birds didn't always follow orders.\n\n\"The only method is to find the pilot and to send someone to the pilot to stop him,\" Wagner said.\n\nThat can be done with frequency spectrum analyzers that can triangulate the drone operator's position, but \"the technology is new and it's not commonly used,\" said Wagner, whose company sells such gear and other counter-drone technology, including radar, jammers and powerful cameras.\n\nChina's DJI Ltd., the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial drones, and some other makers use GPS-based \"geofencing\" to automatically prevent drones from flying over airports and other sensitive locations, though the feature is easy to get around.\n\nDJI also introduced a feature last year that allows authorities to identify and monitor its drones.

Tech executives complain about intellectual property theft in China and what they see as unfair conditions for doing business. But the two regions have strengthened their bonds through investment, trade and partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous cars.\n\nThe tensions have left tech executives questioning what they can share about their work, said Stanley Kwong, adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco.\n\n\u201cAll of these people are worried if they traveled back and forth, they might be arrested because of the IP, something they know and they talk about in both China, and in the USA,\u201d he said.\n\nSilicon Valley firms have complained the relationship \u201cisn\u2019t as reciprocal as it needs to be,\u201d said Sean Randolph, senior director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.\n\nThe relationship, from some tech firms\u2019 point of view, is about \u201cthe extraction of technologies involuntarily from foreign companies to accelerate China's technology leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nCritical technologies\n\nChinese money that has helped fuel the current tech boom in Silicon Valley may start drying up. One reason \u2014 a new U.S. law, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), beefed up oversight of foreign investment and acquisitions of critical technology that are deemed strategically important. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has expanded powers to block foreign purchases of U.S. firms.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley people have been optimistic for a long time,\u201d said Xiaohua Yang, professor of international business at the University of San Francisco. \u201cBut now, they have begun to worry \u2026 about the lack of Chinese investment coming to support Silicon Valley technology development.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are concerned that U.S. tech companies, as they pursue the Chinese market or seek Chinese investment, might hand over core technology to the Chinese government, a competitor and sometime adversary on the global stage. The tech industry waits, as what constitutes \u201ccritical technologies\u201d under FIRRMA is still being developed.\n\nFor U.S. entrepreneurs, the changing climate may mean they will become more cautious, said Kwong, who advises startups.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do business in China, if you're doing consumer products, I say, that's probably fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let's presume you're doing AI.

But Maus\u2019 testimony inspired hundreds of other people to come forward with similar stories of abuse. Faria was arrested Sunday, just nine days after Maus went public with her accusation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really relieved to know how many women came forward,\u201d Maus told Brazilian news site G1. \u201cI have a positive feeling, because it was the reason I decided to give an interview for the first time. It was to open the door for the first time to all the women and girls who suffer abuse to present themselves. And that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nA task force created to investigate Faria had received 506 reports of abuse as of Monday, HuffPost Brazil reports. In Brazil, the flood of allegations against Faria is being compared to the wave of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was first publicly accused of sex crimes last year.\n\nThe speed of the investigation, which led to Faria turning himself in to authorities, is an example of the collective power of women and the importance of reporting abuse, said Maira Pinheiro, a lawyer and member of the Feminist Jurist Network.\n\nMaira Zapater, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Crime and Punishment in S\u00e3o Paulo, told HuffPost Brazil that the similarity in the allegations against Faria has been crucial. One of the main difficulties prosecutors face when investigating sex crimes is the lack of physical evidence and witnesses.\n\nBut 12 women have shared their stories publicly since Maus first spoke out, and their accounts have been too similar for skeptics to dismiss. They have described a pattern of abuse that began with them visiting Faria\u2019s healing center in search of cures for personal problems. They said Faria invited them to a private consultation after an initial meeting, which is when the abuse, masked as \u201ctreatment,\u201d began.\n\nMaus described a similar scenario in her TV appearance. She said the \u201ctreatment\u201d culminated in Faria raping her at his healing center four years ago.\n\nShe said she kept the allegation to herself because she was worried she\u2019d be persecuted by Faria\u2019s followers and because she believed \u201che was curing thousands of people.\u201d\n\nApart from being relevant in the production of data, reporting is also relevant because it removes the victim from that position of, \u2018I\u2019m not sure what happened\u2019 or \u2018I must be crazy.\u2019 Maira Pinheiro, a lawyer and member of the Feminist Jurist Network\n\nZapater said it is common for survivors of sexual violence to keep quiet.\n\n\u201cWe still often see women who are afraid to go to police stations for fear of having their word questioned, since they cannot present any materials proving the violence they have suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a failure that is not even discussed in current legal courses. Professionals come to deal with these situations completely unprepared, and often these women are embarrassed.\u201d\n\nWhy Reporting Matters\n\nFailure to report abuse leads to impunity and tolerance for gender-based violence, as well as to inaccurate statistics, experts say.\n\nIn Brazil, for example, more than 60,000 cases of violence against women were reported in 2017. That figure jumps to 500,000 when underreporting is taken into account.\n\n\u201cReporting is important so that the state and society can investigate the reasons why crimes against women still occur, how they occur and against whom they occur,\u201d Pinheiro said. \u201cBut apart from being relevant in the production of data, reporting is also relevant because it removes the victim from that position of, \u2018I\u2019m not sure what happened\u2019 or \u2018I must be crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nEVARISTO SA via Getty Images Followers of Faria pray at his \"healing center\" on Dec. 12.\n\nSurvivors sometimes struggle with self-doubt and believe abusers who try to convince them the violence was warranted, Pinheiro said. It is this sort of \u201crape culture,\u201d she added, that results in victims struggling to comprehend \u201cthat what happened to them is, in fact, a crime.\u201d\n\nPinheiro also said Brazil needs to do more to help people who report sexual and gender-based violence, including guaranteeing them access to health and social services as well as financial autonomy programs. They aren\u2019t always granted such protections, which she said may lead some women to stay with their abuser.\n\nNext Steps\n\nFaria, via his lawyers, has denied all allegations against him.\n\n\u201cIt is important to say that the voices and the faces of the [accusers] were not shown,\u201d Alberto Toron, a lawyer on Faria\u2019s defense team, said in an interview with Brazilian newspaper Folha, referring to the fact that only Maus and businesswoman Aline Saleh have gone on the record publicly with their accusations.\n\n\u201cSo you see, you cannot hear the voice nor see the face,\u201d Toron said. \u201cThese things were said to have happened more than 10 years ago. Others more than four years ago. It is impossible to even remember if he knows the person.\u201d\n\nFaria withdrew nearly $9 million before surrendering to police, according to The Associated Press, and investigators found firearms and large quantities of cash in a house Faria used as a spiritual retreat.\n\nHe is currently in custody as the investigation continues."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Kurdish-Led U.S. Ally In Syria Says Withdrawing Troops Will Aid Islamic State", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kurdish-led-us-ally-in-syria-says-withdrawing-troops-will-aid-islamic-state_us_5c1b85b4e4b05c88b6f55f8f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The United States\u2019 main ally in Syria on Thursday rejected President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Islamic State militants have been defeated and warned that the withdrawal of American troops would lead to a resurgence of the extremist group.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement that a premature U.S. pullout would have dangerous repercussions and a destabilizing effect on the entire region.\n\n\u201cThe war against terrorism has not ended and (the Islamic State group) has not been defeated,\u201d the statement said, adding that the fight against IS was at a \u201cdecisive\u201d stage that requires even more support from the U.S.-led coalition.

Turkish tanks and armored vehicles are deployed on the border, with thousands of allied Arab Syrian fighters mobilized to join in the attack.\n\nThe threat from Turkey could drive the Kurds into the arms of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and by extension Iran and Russia.\n\n\u201cThis is expected,\u201d Ebrahim Ebrahim, a Syrian Kurd based in Europe, said of the pullout. \u201cBut it is not just treason to the Kurds or the people of Syria but to democracy, to morals, if this is true. Yes, true, we fought for ourselves, but we also fought for democracies all over the world,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the U.S. decision to withdraw its forces from Syria, saying he agreed with Trump that the defeat of the Islamic State group removes the need for the U.S. military presence. Russia has long held that the U.S. presence in Syria is illegitimate because it hasn\u2019t been vetted by the U.N. Security Council or approved by the Syrian government.\n\nRussia is a key ally of Assad, and its military intervention, beginning in 2015, turned the tide of the war in his favor.\n\nA Syrian member of parliament, Peter Marjana, said Thursday that a U.S. pullout would be a \u201crecognition that Syria has won.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s contention that IS has been defeated contradicted his own experts\u2019 assessments and shocked his party\u2019s lawmakers, who called his decision rash and dangerous.\n\nEarlier this month, Kurdish fighters entered Hajin, the last IS enclave in Syria, but battles continues.

The leaders are trying to arrange another meeting for early next year.\n\nBut North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. In Thursday\u2019s statement, the North made clear it\u2019s sticking to its traditional stance on denuclearization. It accused Washington of twisting what had been agreed on in Singapore and driving post-summit talks into an impasse.\n\n\u201cThe United States must now recognize the accurate meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and especially, must study geography,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the Korean Peninsula, it includes the territory of our republic and also the entire region of (South Korea) where the United States has placed its invasive force, including nuclear weapons. When we talk about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means the removal of all sources of nuclear threat, not only from the South and North but also from areas neighboring the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images File photo, taken on July 4, 2017, shows North Korea's test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 at an undisclosed location.\n\nThe United States removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the 1990s. Washington and Seoul did not immediately respond to the North Korean statement.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reiteration of its long-standing position on denuclearization could prove to be a major setback for diplomacy, which was revived early this year following a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests that left Kim and Trump spending most of 2017 exchanging personal insults and war threats. The statement could jeopardize a second Trump-Kim summit as the United States may have difficulty negotiating further if the North ties the future of its nukes to the U.S. military presence in the South, analysts said.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim three times this year and lobbied hard for the Trump-Kim meeting, has said Kim wasn\u2019t demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula as a precondition for abandoning his nuclear weapons. But Kim has never made such comments in public.\n\n\u201cThe blunt statement could be an indicator that the North has no intentions to return to the negotiation table anytime soon,\u201d said Shin Beomchul, a senior analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the North intends to keep its nukes and turn the diplomatic process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation with the United States, rather than a process where it unilaterally surrenders its program.\u201d\n\nYang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul\u2019s University of North Korean Studies, said that the North will likely maintain its commitment to talks but has also been strengthening its demands for sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cPyongyang is sending a message to Washington that confrontation and dialogue cannot coexist,\u201d Yang said.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the Trump-Kim meeting. The United States wants North Korea to provide a detailed account of nuclear and missile facilities that would be inspected and dismantled under a potential deal, while the North is insisting that sanctions be lifted first.\n\nSince engaging in diplomacy, North Korea has unilaterally dismantled its nuclear testing ground and parts of a missile engine test facility and suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests. However, none of those moves were verified by outsiders, and most experts say they fall short as material steps toward denuclearization. In the third meeting between Kim and Moon in September, the North also said it would dismantle its main nuclear facility in Nyongbyon if the United States takes \u201ccorresponding measures,\u201d which the state media later specified as sanctions relief.\n\nKim declared his nuclear force was complete after the torrent of weapons tests in 2017, including the detonation of a purported thermonuclear weapon and three test-flights of intercontinental ballistic missiles potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Several reports from private analysts in recent weeks have accused North Korea of continuing nuclear and missile development, citing details from commercial satellite imagery.\n\n\u201cIf we unilaterally give up our nuclear weapons without any security assurance despite being first on the U.S. list of targets for pre-emptive nuclear strikes, that wouldn\u2019t be denuclearization \u2014 it would rather be a creation of a defenseless state where the balance in nuclear strategic strength is destroyed and the crisis of a nuclear war is brought forth,\u201d the KCNA said.\n\n\u201cThe corresponding measures we have asked the United States to take aren\u2019t difficult for the United States to commit to and carry out. We are just asking the United States to put an end to its hostile policies (on North Korea) and remove the unjust sanctions, things it can do even without a snap of a finger.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Ambassador's Sudden Exit Amid Deportation Fight Was Totally Normal, State Department Says", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-osius-vietnam-state-department_us_5c1935bbe4b0432554c4ea60", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Osius, a career diplomat, disagreed with Trump administration policy.

Raising the overused and often distorted rallying cry of censorship, these critics forget the fact that Fox News, like every other network, carefully monitors who and what appears on its airwaves every day.\n\nFox News condemns and even bars content it views as crossing a line. So by standing by Carlson, it\u2019s actually the network that has forced activists\u2019 hand: The only way to stop Carlson from spewing hate and lies on Fox News\u2019 air is to hit Fox News where it hurts.\n\nThis year Carlson laughed off a gay survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida \u2014 who later received death threats \u2014 who spoke out against the homophobic views of Vice President Mike Pence. And Carlson has frequently made his show a platform for bashing transgender people.\n\nThe companies that have joined this boycott have been informed of Carlson\u2019s vile views by prominent individuals like Hollywood director Judd Apatow and by online activist groups like Sleeping Giants. Their pressure has led the companies to decide they don\u2019t want an association with Carlson.\n\nCONFIRMED: @HarrisTeeter has asked their cable company to no longer place them on Tucker Carlson Tonight or Fox. https://t.co/i5pGwhWZqD \u2014 Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) December 20, 2018\n\nThis is not an infringement of Carlson\u2019s free speech. It\u2019s combating him with more speech. Consumers have the right to speak with their voices and their wallets, and advertisers have the right to speak with their ad dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s as American as apple pie.\n\nNo one, least of all the government, is seeking to censor Carlson from expressing these views. He has the right to speak his mind on a street corner or in a public park or anywhere else. He can even organize a parade chock full of expressions of those views (though, as with other regulations surrounding the First Amendment, he will likely have to get a permit, which would be granted him, as vile as the parade would be).\n\nThere, is, however, no right to a television program on a privately owned network whose owners have their own rights and, more important, their own self-defined responsibilities.\n\nThis should be clear as day, but without fail, every time a hatemonger on a major news outlet is boycotted by companies responding to consumers, there are those who get all wobbly, worried about stifled speech.\n\nMedia columnist Jack Shafer at Politico wrote of the current Carlson debacle, \u201cI\u2019m made queasy by crusades that charge corporate advertisers with the power to decide what ideas should be discussed and how they should be discussed.\u201d\n\nHe picked up on a tweet by polling analyst Nate Silver, in which the FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief worried about the hypothetical ramifications of advertiser boycotts:\n\nJack is right. The logical endpoint of deeming advertisers to have endorsed the political messages of the shows they run ads on is that only milquetoast both-sidesism with a pro-corportate bent will be advertising-supported, if any political content is ad-supported at all. https://t.co/R5yrH0jN3o \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) December 19, 2018\n\nShafer agreed that the boycotts would effectively mean allowing advertisers to dictate the news, writing, \u201cSeriously, I barely trust IHOP to make my breakfast. Why would I expect it to vet my cable news content for me?\u201d\n\nThese takes are overblown and discuss the issue in the abstract. It\u2019s doubtful that Shafer and Silver believe that ABC or CNN should allow a commentator to derogatorily use the N-word on air or that we should be concerned if advertisers pulled out as a result.\n\nThat\u2019s an extreme example, but that\u2019s the point. Just about every successful \u2014 and that\u2019s the key word, successful \u2014 boycott of a broadcast show or outlet is about an extreme case, and Carlson\u2019s open promotion of white supremacy and racist ideology is an extreme case.\n\nBoycotts are hard to organize and sustain, and to be effective, the target must be engaging in egregious behavior that offends a vast array of Americans across age, race, gender and locale. Merely having different points of view \u2014 whether conservative or progressive \u2014 isn\u2019t going to sustain an advertiser boycott. Thus, Silver\u2019s concerns about companies responding to consumers not liking, for example, The Washington Post just because of the bent of its coverage, and pulling advertising is alarmist. Advertisers don\u2019t just blithely give up solid forums to sell goods.\n\nBoycotts are successful because those who create them believe they are morally right and necessary and because a groundswell of consumers agree with them.\n\nCBS was hobbled in 2001, for example, when it tried to launch Dr. Laura Schlessinger\u2019s television show. The radio host had made a name for herself with crude perspectives about women and minority groups, including calling gays a \u201cbiological error.\u201d Concerned gay people, myself included, created a campaign building an advertiser boycott of the show. Many companies, seeing how out of step the comments were with the American people at the time, agreed.\n\nAnti-LGBTQ groups, on the other hand, have tried over and over again to boycott everything from Disney to Apple because of what they vilify as a pro-LGBTQ agenda. But these boycotts have failed miserably every time because the groups couldn\u2019t get support beyond their limited demographic of conservative evangelicals.\n\nThe hypothetical that Shafer and Silver fear hasn\u2019t happened, and we\u2019ve been at this for quite some time.\n\nThere\u2019s also much that Fox News could have done and could still do in the current situation to forestall a boycott.\n\nIn June it strongly condemned a guest\u2019s use of the term \u201ccotton-picking mind\u201d to describe a black Democrat. The network called the comments \u201cdeeply offensive and wholly inappropriate.\u201d The guest, Donald Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign manager David Bossie, was made to apologize. I didn\u2019t see the censorship police coming to his defense.\n\nOn Thanksgiving a Fox News host cut off a guest who compared Hillary Clinton to herpes. Host Rick Leventhal, became uncomfortable after guest Anna Paulina said Clinton \u201cwon\u2019t go away. She\u2019s like herpes.\u201d According to reports, producers cut Paulina off the air as Leventhal called the comments \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and then apologized for \u201csome of the language that was used in the segment.\u201d\n\nLater, another network host made a more emphatic apology.\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate that we do not condone the language that Anna Paulina just displayed here, and we apologize to Secretary Clinton for that,\u201d Arthel Neville said. \u201cFox News does not condone her sentiment.\u201d (Paulina issued an apology on Twitter the next day.)\n\nAgain, where were the censorship police? And why does Fox News have a double standard? Those insults are clearly not worthy of the network, but saying immigrants make our country \u201cdirtier\u201d is?\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that left wing advocacy groups, under the guise of being supposed \u2018media watchdogs\u2019 weaponize social media against companies in an effort to stifle free speech,\u201d a Fox spokesperson said this week, responding to the boycott. \u201cWe continue to stand by and work with our advertisers through these unfortunate and unnecessary distractions.\u201d A later statement from the network echoed the characterization that Carlson was being \u201ccensored.\u201d\n\nIf someone other than Carlson had said what he did, would Fox News have the same stance? Remember how Sean Hannity was given a pass (a mild rebuke) by the network when he went onstage with Trump at a rally last month \u2014 even though it is against Fox News policy? Of course, he, like Carlson, is a cash cow for the network and thus likely untouchable."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "James Mattis' Resignation Has Conservatives Admitting It's 'Time To Panic' About Trump", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-mattis-retirement-reaction-republicans_us_5c1c2eb7e4b08aaf7a86bbf9", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "Mattis has been the adult in the room when it comes to national security policy and I find his impending departure alarming.

Sometimes all it takes to thwart a party\u2019s agenda is a little bit of office dysfunction \u2014 look no further than the current occupant of the White House.\n\nThe same consideration applies to anyone angling to replace President Donald Trump, which is why HuffPost went looking for a way to quantify the health or toxicity of those would-be candidates\u2019 current workplaces. Ultimately, we turned to Legistorm, a vast database of congressional staffers and their salaries, and its calculations of staff turnover.\n\nBased on data from 2001 to 2017, here are the rankings for 17 members of Congress who are thought to be exploring a Democratic Party run for president, from greatest turnover to least:\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (0.40)\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (0.35)\n\nRep. John Delaney (0.26)\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (0.25)\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (0.23)\n\nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (0.23)\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (0.21)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (0.19)\n\nSen. Cory Booker (0.17)\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (0.16)\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (0.15)\n\nSen. Mark Warner (0.15)\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (0.13)\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (0.13)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (0.12)\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (0.11)\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (0.11)\n\nThe number next to each name \u2014 the \u201cturnover index\u201d \u2014 reflects the share of salaries within each member\u2019s office that has turned over as opposed to the share of people. Legistorm uses this calculation so that the departure of highly paid staff, who in theory have more desirable jobs, outweighs the departure of lower-paid staff, who may more readily move around.\n\nThe list comes with several caveats, the biggest being that turnover isn\u2019t automatically the product of a dysfunctional office. It can just as easily reflect a change in the lawmaker\u2019s staffing needs (due to, say, a new committee assignment) or a fluke. The more recently a member was elected to Congress, the smaller the sample size will be and the less reliable the calculation in describing long-term trends.\n\nMembers of party leadership also tend to have higher staff turnover because their offices offer a stepping stone to other plum positions. In fact, when Legistorm uses its turnover index to make its own \u201cWorst Bosses?\u201d list, it excludes party leaders. Nearly half the members on HuffPost\u2019s list have at one point served in party leadership: Brown, Gillibrand, Murphy, Ryan, Sanders, Warner and Warren.\n\nIn addition, staff turnover tends to surge when a lawmaker prepares to leave Congress or run for a new office. O\u2019Rourke announced his bid for the Senate in March 2017, and Delaney announced in June 2017 that he was running for president.\n\nFinally, Legistorm\u2019s calculations don\u2019t include interns, fellows, shared staff or anyone employed less than 30 days. And of course, Legistorm\u2019s data doesn\u2019t cover mayors or governors contemplating a presidential run in 2020.\n\nSo why look at the numbers at all?\n\nBecause, as Legistorm puts it, \u201cOffices with the most staff turnover might also include some of the worst bosses.\u201d A bad boss can foster an ineffectual office \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t truly serve the member\u2019s constituents or accomplish legislative goals on behalf of voters."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Hemp Is Officially Going Legal Nationwide", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hemp-legal-farm-bill-states_us_5c1c1ac1e4b08aaf7a86ae4f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump signed the 2018 farm bill into law Thursday, which will officially make industrial hemp legal across all 50 states.\n\nThe farm bill, which Congress passed with bipartisan votes last week, includes a section removing hemp \u2015 a term typically used to describe non-intoxicating forms of cannabis \u2015 from the Controlled Substances Act.

CBD is typically derived from hemp.\n\nDrug policy reformers and hemp industry groups had also hoped that the final bill would be passed without a statute permanently prohibiting individuals with prior felony drug charges from working on hemp operations.

Mattis had previously argued that a small U.S. presence should remain because the counterterrorism mission there is ongoing and removing troops now would cause more problems for the region. Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that \u201cleaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.\u201d\n\nSIPA USA/PA Images Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has denied telling staffers that Trump has the understanding of a \u201cfifth- or sixth-grader.\u201d\n\nNews of Mattis\u2019 departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.\n\nSome of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri.\n\nTrump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with him.\n\nThat assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a \u201cfifth- or sixth-grader.\u201d Mattis has denied having said that.\n\nA major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin. The defense secretary has characterized Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms.\n\n\u201c[Putin\u2019s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,\u201d Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.\n\nTrump, in contrast, has praised Putin\u2019s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russia\u2019s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations. Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters Mattis became the latest high-profile appointee to leave the Trump administration.\n\nMattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement. Iran was following the pact\u2019s rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015.\n\nTrump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.\n\nMattis opposed Trump\u2019s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects.\n\nHis most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trump\u2019s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad\u2019s regime in that nation\u2019s civil war.\n\nEven then, Mattis\u2019 recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president. Trump overruled the defense secretary and unilaterally ordered the military assault.\n\nMattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.\n\nReince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

Scott Applewhite/ASSOCIATED PRESS House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California talks to reporters as Congress tries to pass legislation to avert a partial government shutdown Thursday.\n\nDemocratic leaders on Thursday tapped Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) to head a revived U.S. House panel on climate change, all but ending a dramatic monthlong effort to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nCastor\u2019s appointment came as a surprise to proponents of a Green New Deal. The move also kicked off a controversy as the six-term congresswoman dismissed calls to bar members who accept money from fossil fuel companies from serving on the committee, arguing it would violate free speech rights.\n\nDespite weeks of protests demanding House Democrats focus efforts next year on drafting a Green New Deal, the sort of sweeping economic policy that scientists say matches the scale of the climate crisis, Castor told E&E News the plan was \u201cnot going to be our sole focus.\u201d\n\nShe then suggested that barring members who have accepted donations from the oil, gas and coal industries from serving on the committee could be unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can do that under the First Amendment, really,\u201d she said.\n\nThat reasoning echoed arguments Exxon Mobil Corp. made in court as recently as this year to defend its funding of right-wing think tanks that deliberately produced misinformation about climate science to stymie government action on global warming.\n\nSoon after the remarks were published, Castor walked back the statement in an interview with HuffPost, calling it an \u201cinartful answer.\u201d\n\nBut she said she did not know whether, as chairperson, she could bar members on the committee from serving if they accepted fossil fuel donations.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s a discussion we need to have in the caucus,\u201d Castor said.\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning upset, essentially returning Democrats to the original plan leaders laid out before the protests began in November. The announcement comes as a loss for Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Her meteoric rise and devoted base made it seem as if she were poised to win the burgeoning cadre of leftist Democrats a beachhead in a select committee that, even with limited capacity, would have demonstrated tangible power in Washington.\n\nBut, if it\u2019s defeat, it\u2019s bittersweet. The campaign, seemingly quixotic at first, shifted the stagnant climate policy debate not just to the left but, for the first time, in the direction of policies that could make a dent in surging global emissions and curb soaring income inequality. Coupled with back-to-back United Nations and federal reports that showed climate change already rapidly worsening, the effort established a new litmus test for lawmakers, breaking the binary of whether or not a politicians \u201cbelieves\u201d in the science of human-caused warming.\n\nThe movement gained stunning support in just a few weeks. A poll released Monday found 81 percent of registered voters supported the policies outlined under the Green New Deal resolution \u2015 including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last Friday, more than 300 state and local officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to sit on our hands as our planet burns,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday in a tweet. \u201cFor young people, climate change is bigger than election or re-election. It\u2019s life or death.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez will even get a seat on the select committee.\n\nChris O'Meara/Associated Press Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) at a campaign rally in 2012.\n\nAsked if she accepted money from fossil fuel companies, Castor said, \u201cI cannot think of a contribution from an oil company or fossil fuel company, but I cannot say without going back and with a fine-toothed comb that there wasn\u2019t something in the past.\u201d\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Castor accepted more than $73,000 from the energy and natural resources sector over her 12-year tenure in Congress, including $60,000 from corporate political action committees. The League of Conservation Voters gave Castor an 86 percent score last year on its ranking, which is based on her voting record. She had a 93 percent lifetime score.\n\nShe said she would consider taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a vow overseen by a handful of progressive groups including proponents of a Green New Deal. Asked what the decision hinged on, Castor said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at year-end with a possible shutdown and I think the important thing is looking at folks for the committee who are ready to serve,\u201d she said.\n\nThe restoration of the select committee on climate change puts an end to a month-long effort to replace it with a panel focused specifically on crafting a Green New Deal, an umbrella term for a suite of policies that would include shifting the United States to 100 percent renewable energy over the next decade and guaranteeing high-wage, federally backed jobs to workers in outmoded industries.\n\nThe proposal stormed into mainstream political debate over the past month after protesters from the progressive groups Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats held sit-ins in Pelosi\u2019s office. The demonstrations came in response to what they saw as plans for a tepid response to the climate crisis when the party takes control of the House next month.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a left-wing firebrand with a powerful online following, joined the protests and proposed swapping Pelosi\u2019s plan to restore the climate select committee with a plan for a panel devoted to the Green New Deal.\n\nFor a few weeks, it seemed likely to happen. More than 40 incoming or sitting House Democrats pledged to support the resolution, and nearly half a dozen senators announced their support for the effort, including at least three likely 2020 presidential contenders.\n\nBut the proposal ruffled feathers in Washington. Incoming chairmen of committees that traditionally oversee energy and environmental policy complained that a Green New Deal select committee would strip them of legislative power. And Beltway veterans privately expressed frustration that a cadre of insurgent freshmen, some of whom toppled long-time allies in primaries, were using their grassroots popularity to call shots.\n\nSusan Walsh/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nDemocratic leaders responded in kind, declining to contact activists or Ocasio-Cortez before announcing plans to ignore the resolution and restore the previous climate select committee instead.\n\nRepresentatives from Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats confirmed they were not told of the decision until they read about it on E&E News. Castor said she \u201cchatted with Rep.-elect Ocasio-Cortez, but not specifically on this.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sunrise Movement said a select committee \u201cthat makes a plan for implementing a Green New Deal is an opportunity for Democrats in the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a mandate to create a plan and a requirement that its members don\u2019t take fossil fuel money, we are deeply concerned that this committee will be just another of the many committees we\u2019ve seen failing our generation our entire lives,\u201d Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movement\u2019s co-founder, said in a statement.\n\nLater Thursday evening, Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the group would continue the fight.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi has the power to determine whether or not the Select Committee for a Green New Deal lives or dies,\u201d Weber said. \u201cSunrise Movement\u2019s position is and will continue to be that it\u2019s not over until she makes it clear that it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nBut, earlier this week, Democratic leaders announced that a Green New Deal select committee would lack subpoena power, seemingly sounding the death knell for the resolution.\n\nCastor said the select committee she agreed to chair would likely have subpoena power, but not legislative power. She said she did not know yet which individuals or companies she would use that power to investigate.\n\n\u201cI honestly thought the Democratic Party leaders would see this opportunity,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group championing the Green New Deal proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating to see a fellow Democrat basically parrot the talking points of the Koch Brothers when it comes to the very common-sense idea that any politician who accepts donations from the fossil-fuel corporations should not be allowed to legislate on climate change.\u201d\n\nBut Castor\u2019s appointment won praise from establishment environmental groups.\n\n\u201cRep. Kathy Castor is an outstanding choice to help lead the House\u2019s renewed focus on climate change,\u201d John Bowman, senior director for federal affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. \u201cAs a longtime environmental champion, few are better suited to help shine a bright light on the threats Americans face from the climate crisis and advance the solutions we urgently need.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Shutdown Drama Over Long-Promised Wall Goes To Season Finale", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turmp-shutdown-finale-border-wall_us_5c1c19ffe4b0407e9078d6ab", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump brought government-shutdown fever to a boil on Dec. 20 with a tweet threatening a veto of a two-month spending package if it did not provide funds for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Will the president sacrifice the start of a golfing vacation at his Florida resort to demand money for his border wall? Or will he find some way to claim he has \u201cwon\u201d on the issue and fly south on schedule?\n\nOr will he truly defy expectations by rejecting a temporary spending bill and going to Palm Beach anyway amid a partial government shutdown?\n\nAmericans will find out, one way or another, in this season\u2019s finale of the Donald Trump presidency Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump brought shutdown fever to a boil with a tweet threatening a veto of a two-month spending package \u2014 before appearing to talk himself down at a bill signing, where he said he wanted money for \u201cborder security\u201d and a physical barrier but not making specific demands about either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,\u201d Trump said in prepared remarks he delivered just before he signed this year\u2019s farm bill into law. He added that money must also be there for some type of barrier. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can do. Hopefully, that will all come together.\u201d\n\nNotably, though, Trump did not name a dollar figure for what he would need to sign the bill. Nor did he state what project or projects would have to be funded.\n\nThe spending bill extension passed by the Senate late Wednesday continues funding at a $1.6 billion annual rate for refurbishing and upgrading the existing fence on about one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 thus meeting both of Trump\u2019s stated requirements.\n\nWhether that\u2019s enough for Trump\u2019s hard-core base is unclear.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally, said the word from residents in his district was \u201cget it done\u201d and that \u201cwe build it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I heard very loudly and very clearly from my constituents is they don\u2019t want us to just give up on this particular issue, and so it\u2019s important that we fight on their behalf,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump earlier in the day wrote on Twitter that the Senate-passed bill was not good enough. \u201cWhen I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW),\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!\u201d\n\nHours later, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Meadows and fellow Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) met with Trump at the White House, after which Ryan said Trump made it clear he would not sign what the Senate passed.\n\n\u201cThe president informed us that he will not sign the bill that came up from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security,\u201d Ryan said afterward.\n\nThat, though, was not long before Trump seemed to soften his demands at the farm bill signing.\n\nIf Thursday\u2019s spending bill crisis seemed familiar, that\u2019s because it was a repeat of an episode from earlier in the year, when Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the entire government funded through the end of the budget year in September.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget director held a press briefing the day before the scheduled signing and assured reporters that Trump would sign the measure, even though it had no money for the border wall.\n\nBut that night and the following morning, Trump\u2019s readiness to approve a spending package that was that big but did not include even a single dollar to build the wall that he had promised was hammered on by Fox News hosts. Trump responded with a tweet suggesting he would veto the package. Congressional Republicans scrambled to talk Trump out of that threat.\n\nTrump wound up signing the bill, claiming he was doing so because of all the money it contained for the military, and vowed not to sign another one if it did not include wall money.\n\nBut he has since approved two more funding bills for the Department of Homeland Security that did not contain money for the border wall. The first was in September, at the urging of congressional Republicans who warned that a shutdown so close to the November midterms would hurt them. The second was two weeks ago, because of the death and subsequent state funeral of former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nAnd Thursday\u2019s heightened, then lowered shutdown tensions follow a week of such oscillations. Last week Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), that he would be \u201cproud\u201d to shoulder the responsibility for a partial shutdown.\n\nSince then, though, the White House sent signals that Trump was seeking to avoid a shutdown. First, it said that a compromise number between the $1.6 billion that Democrats support and the $5 billion that Trump wants would be acceptable. And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday that Trump would be able to find money for his wall from other sources.\n\nCritical coverage on Fox and by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in the past two days appeared to have yet again pushed Trump toward favoring a veto. Limbaugh on Thursday told his listeners that Trump had, during the program, assured him that he would veto a bill that did not pay for his wall.\n\nTrump promised many hundreds of times during his campaign that American taxpayers would not have to pay anything for his 30-foot-tall, concrete \u201cgreat wall\u201d because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But nearly two years into his presidency, Trump has yet to publicly broach the subject even a single time with that country\u2019s leaders.\n\nThe make-Mexico-pay part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexico\u2019s president at the time, according to leaked transcripts published by the Washington Post, Trump told Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "In Rare Statement, Mitch McConnell Says He's 'Distressed' Over Jim Mattis' Resignation", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-jim-mattis_us_5c1c55f2e4b0407e9078fc16", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he is \u201cparticularly distressed\u201d over the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who announced Thursday he would be leaving early next year after irreconcilable policy differences with President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s essential that the United States maintain and strengthen the post-World War II alliances that have been carefully built by leaders in both parties. We must also maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes, and recognize that nations like Russia are among the latter,\u201d McConnell said in an unusually blunt statement on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cSo I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis, who shares those clear principles, will soon depart the administration.

What added to the consternation was the list of grievances Mattis detailed in a remarkable letter Thursday, in which he said he and Trump had differing views on countering Russian and Chinese authoritarianism, as well as the utility and importance of alliances across the globe.\n\n\u201cBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,\u201d Mattis said in the letter.\n\nMattis was also reportedly incensed by Trump\u2019s decision this week to unilaterally and abruptly withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a move lawmakers fear will allow the self-described Islamic State to thrive and cause further instability in the region.\n\nIn his statement, McConnell urged Trump to nominate a replacement for Mattis who agrees with Mattis\u2019 worldview.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that the president must now choose a new Secretary of Defense.

They predicted 100 people would show, and ended up hosting more than 300, even having to turn some people away.\n\n\u201cI almost cried when I saw there was a line down the block,\u201d Stevenson recalled. \u201cFor so long I was like, \u2018Is this just me who wants to see something like this?\u2019\u201d\n\nJacquie Ray Alison Stevenson, one of the event's co-founders.\n\nThat feeling subsided as soon as she heard what Jasmine Newkirk, one of the dancers, called \u201cdeafening\u201d cheers. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so confident in myself than when I took my robe off to reveal my plus-size body in lingerie,\u201d Newkirk said. \u201cEver.\u201d\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just powerful for the dancers. Flores, who worked the door of the event, said the impact the show had on participants was major. \u201cI had people coming up to me in tears saying it was the most inspiring thing they\u2019d ever seen,\u201d she said.\n\nDancer Seraphina Rose called the reaction one of the most empowering parts of the experience. \u201cIt was hearing from the audience that watching all of us perform and take ownership of our bodies made them go home and dance naked in their bedroom mirror and/or cry in happiness,\u201d she said.\n\nThicc Strips\u2019 dancers all echoed a similar, sweeping message for media and the way it pushes society\u2019s narrow view of beauty: Simply, that the media is wrong, that it\u2019s time to see more realistic bodies, that there is an audience for them and that it\u2019s time to stop putting people \u2015 namely women \u2015 in boxes.\n\nJacquie Ray Vanessa Gritton dances for her audience during Thicc Strip.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what I am and what I\u2019m not,\u201d Flores said. \u201cI am fat AND beautiful, and if I want to jump on stage and show the world what my body is capable of, no one can stop me.\u201d\n\nStevenson said the group has already started talking about the next event and its hopes to include anyone who wants to experience something like this. \u201cIt\u2019s such a challenge, but once you accept and conquer it you feel ten times better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain, but it really feels like you\u2019ve grown so much just showing people your tits [laughs].\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Amazon Gives Access To 1,700 Alexa Audio Home Files To The Wrong Guy", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-alexa-1700-audio-files_us_5c1c6edce4b0407e9079044d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Amazon\u2019s Alexa has been caught eavesdropping again.\n\nWhen a German Amazon customer requested his archived data to review, he received a link to 1,700 Alexa audio files that belonged to a complete stranger.\n\nThe files provided much of the same kind of recorded information that would likely be collected by a bug planted in someone\u2019s house.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Jim Mattis, Defense Secretary, Resigns in Rebuke of Trump\u2019s Worldview", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/jim-mattis-defense-secretary-trump.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-21 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.\n\nMr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States\u2019 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far.\n\nOfficials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.\n\nMr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed.

Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\n\nOne core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO\u2019s 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.\n\nSimilarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model \u2014 gaining veto authority over other nations\u2019 economic, diplomatic, and security decisions \u2014 to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies.

The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department\u2019s interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February.
