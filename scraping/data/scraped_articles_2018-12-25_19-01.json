I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it,\" he said.\n\nAs uniformed servicemen were beamed into the Oval Office via satellite from US bases in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar -- but not war zones like Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria -- Trump said he was pleased to see rich nations like Qatar -- \"There are many, many ways of pronouncing it,\" Trump observed of the Gulf nation -- chipping in for regional security efforts.\n\n\"It will be nice when we can ask for a lot less money for our military,\" Trump said, without referring specifically to recent decisions to draw down troops in Syria and Afghanistan. \"We're, right now, the policemen of the world and we're paying for it. And we can be the policemen of the world, but other countries have to help us.\"\n\nAnd though he expressed confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who spooked investors on Monday by making public his calls with bank CEOs to check on their liquidity, Trump again faulted the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too quickly, worrying investors and causing stocks to tumble. He insisted the market was ripe for buyers.\n\n\"I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy,\" he said. \"Really a great opportunity to buy.\"\n\nTrump has spent the past several days cooped up in the White House, leaving only on Christmas Eve for an evening service at the National Cathedral. Originally planning to spend the holiday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump canceled the trip after the partial government shutdown went into effect.\n\nHe's the first president to spend Christmas at the White House in 18 years; the last was Bill Clinton in 2000. George W. Bush spent the holiday at Camp David during his eight years in office, while Barack Obama traveled to his native Hawaii.\n\n\"I love the White House, but I wasn't able to be with my family. I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family, my family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting,\" Trump explained on Tuesday -- speaking presumably about his adult children, since first lady Melania Trump returned to the White House on Monday to spend the holiday with him.\n\nHe claimed, without evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall -- and support him in his mission.\n\n\"Many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall,\" he claimed, though didn't identify who the workers were.\n\nHe insisted in lengthy remarks the prolonged shutdown was the fault of Democrats, and repeated his demands a border barrier be funded before the government can reopen. In a sign the deadlock will continue, Trump announced he would travel to Texas in late January to observe part of the wall being built.\n\nBut he did not offer any new method of getting Democrats to sign off on funding, beyond saying he was always willing to meet with Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and the presumed incoming House speaker, Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Instead, he decried his political opponents as preparing for \"presidential harassment\" once they gain control of the House in January.\n\n\"We know how to handle that,\" Trump said. \"I know how to handle that better than anybody.\"\n\nDescribing the opposing party as hypocrites for what he claimed was onetime support for a border wall, Trump transitioned sharply into a screed on Comey, who he fired early in his term.\n\n\"Everybody hated Comey, they thought he did a horrible job. The Democrats hated him. They were calling for his resignation. They were calling for his firing,\" Trump said. Some Democrats faulted Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Later, Trump's firing of Comey was viewed by many Democrats as a way to short-circuit the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\n\"Once I fired him, everybody said, 'Oh, why did you fire him, why did you fire him?'\" Trump said, waving his hands in irritation."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump sets completion date for border wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/xt32NYYnPiA/trump-border-wall-completion-date-sot-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

In a shortened Christmas Eve session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 600 points after a bizarre attempt by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday to calm investors by consulting with the CEOs of top banks backfired . Losses were compounded by another of Trump's Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve -- following revelations that he has asked if he can legally fire the independent central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nThe Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n\nTrump turns to Twitter while \"all alone\" in the White House\n\nWhile many Americans gathered with their families and with his vacation to the \"Winter White House\" at Mar-a-Lago iced by the shutdown, the President spent the day at the White House blasting critics -- including Democrats who have refused his demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that shuttered the government at midnight on Friday.\n\n\"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\" Trump wrote in what may have been a tongue in cheek tone in his 10th tweet of the day.\n\nEventually Trump wouldn't be so alone in the executive mansion -- first lady Melania Trump, who decamped to Florida before the shutdown took hold, rejoined the President in Washington Monday night to speak with children who called to track Santa's flight around the world. During those calls, Trump asked one 7-year-old child , \"Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7 it's marginal, right?\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the President lashed out at Brett McGurk, his special envoy for eradicating ISIS, who followed Defense Secretary James Mattis by resigning in protest at Trump's hurriedly announced Syria withdrawal. He hit out at \"Little Bob Corker,\" the outgoing Tennessee senator who has criticized him over Syria and the shutdown. He also insisted he did like allies -- but said many took advantage of the US \"both in 'Military Protection and Trade...' \"\n\nA senior administration official told CNN's Jim Sciutto that national security decision-making has \"basically stopped working\" and decisions are \"made on a whim on phone calls.\" The official added the Syria withdrawal was \"a complete reversal\" and it was done \"without deliberation, no consideration of risks.\"\n\nAmerican allies and partners are \"shocked and totally bewildered\" and the Syrian Democratic Forces \"don't believe this is happening,\" the official said.\n\nIt all added up to a feeling of a White House that is hurtling out of control and a President who is becoming increasingly emotional and vexed at a time when he faces mounting legal and political pressure from special counsel Robert Mueller. He is also days away from a new era of punishing Democratic oversight when the new Congress convenes in early January.\n\nThe loss of Mattis -- who was seen around the world as a check on Trump's erratic national security decision-making -- has raised anxiety about his presidency to previously unmatched levels.\n\nOf course, many Trump supporters voted for disruption and to rattle the Washington establishment when they sent him to the White House so are likely to be less concerned than Washington insiders about the febrile Christmas mood.\n\nBut the President's irascible temper is also detracting from his top achievements at the end of the year, including low unemployment and a strong economy despite market turmoil. The passage of a groundbreaking criminal justice bill has also been overshadowed and there is little talk about his most enduring legacy win -- the new majority he and the Senate GOP engineered on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe President seemed to have his loyal base in mind by engineering a shutdown drama that appears to have no easy exits, but allows him to make a political stand cheered on by the conservative media.\n\n\"AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!\" he tweeted at one point on Monday, likely with those voters in mind.\n\n\"Hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm\"\n\nBut the frenetic Christmas Eve spectacle was stunning even by the President's standards, and prompted the two top Democratic leaders, the likely House speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to issue a joint statement.\n\n\"It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve -- after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,\" the statement said.\n\nAs the shutdown lumbered through its third day, with no end in sight, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas arrived to gavel in the chamber for a pro-forma session that only exemplified the lack of action between the White House and Democrats towards a resolution. He resorted to quoting the earthy wisdom of a former Senate majority leader and President to capture the sense of futility and political dislocation.\n\n\"LBJ said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm and just take it. That's about where we are,\" he said.\n\nBut in one sign that the festive spirit can triumph over Washington's humbug, the National Parks Service announced the reopening of the National Christmas Tree, thanks to support from the National Park Foundation -- a group of philanthropic organizations and donors.\n\nThe popular Yuletide tourist spot had been closed after a man tried to climb the tree and damaged it. The government shutdown then prevented the National Park Service from reopening it.\n\nThe shutdown is the third this year and has sent hundreds of thousands of federal employees home for Christmas unsure about their upcoming paychecks.\n\nAt the same time, the stock market is careening south with much of the blame being put on the confusion coming from Washington.\n\nMnunchin has had to reassure investors Trump won't fire Powell and left major bank CEOs \"totally baffled\" with a weekend call asking them about the state of their businesses. More criticism from Trump toward the Fed sent markets reeling Monday, as the Dow closed down 653 points before shutting up shop early for Christmas Eve.\n\nMnuchin's intervention was just the latest development that sparked uncertainty in the days running up to the holiday.\n\nA surprise announcement that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery for cancerous growths on her lung added to the frenetic mood in Washington, as the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Trump by knocking back his new restrictions on asylum seekers who cross the southern border.\n\nAnd more mystery is brewing in the highest court in the land after Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused an order holding an unnamed, foreign-government owned company in contempt over a court case related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nIt all adds up to a Christmas that is feeling less and less merry and bright on Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump tweets 'poor me' as shutdown continues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/mBKiWbHtSSI/trump-christmas-eve-shutdown-tweets-abby-phillip-lead-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Howell quoted emotional lines of testimony from Warmbier's mother and recounted grim details of his treatment in North Korea that underpinned the judgment.\n\n\"An American family, the Warmbiers, experienced North Korea's brutality first-hand when North Korea seized their son to use as a pawn in that totalitarian state's global shenanigans and face-off with the United States,\" Howell wrote.\n\nNorth Korean officials detained Warmbier in 2016 as he tried to leave the country after spending five days there on a commercial tour. Warmbier, then a student at the University of Virginia, was accused by the government of stealing a political poster from a restricted floor in his hotel.\n\nWarmbier returned to the United States in June of 2017 after negotiations led by the Trump administration. Then 22 years old, Warmbier was blind and deaf and had sustained severe brain damage from his time in detention. He died less than a week later in his hometown of Cincinnati.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Fred and Cindy Warmbier thanked Howell and called the decision a \"significant step on our journey.\"\n\n\"We are thankful that the United States has a fair and open judicial system so that the world can see that the Kim regime is legally and morally responsible for Otto's death. We put ourselves and our family through the ordeal of a lawsuit and public trial because we promised Otto that we will never rest until we have justice for him,\" they said in the statement.\n\n\"As a family, mother, father, sister and brother, we would like to thank all those who knew and loved Otto, and for all those who supported us and our mission to hold Kim liable for his actions,\" they said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe damages awarded to the Warmbiers included $45 million for pain, suffering and grief, and more than $6 million in economic losses that Otto Warmbier would have earned in life based on his exceptional talent, according to an economist's model.\n\nHowell wrote in her opinion that the Warmbiers had established \"ample evidence\" that the damages requested in their suit, which was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in April, met statutory requirements because they arose from \"North Korea's barbaric mistreatment of Otto, including 'torture,' 'hostage taking,' and 'extrajudicial killing.' \"\n\nA North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that Warmbier had been tortured while in North Korean custody, according to a 2017 report by the country's state-run news agency KCNA.\n\nHowell's ruling does not guarantee an immediate windfall for the Warmbiers, however.\n\nNorth Korea did not respond to the lawsuit -- Howell's opinion was rendered as a so-called \"default judgment\" -- and the country has no free assets in the US that the family could make a claim for.\n\nJUST WATCHED Analyst: North Korea needs to provide detailed list of arsenal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Analyst: North Korea needs to provide detailed list of arsenal 04:18\n\nAny damages eventually won by the Warmbiers would likely come from North Korea's frozen US assets, which amounted to about $63 million in 2017, according to the Treasury Department's Terrorist Assets Report, and those potential payments would be limited to the compensatory damages in Howell's opinion -- a narrow portion of their larger award.\n\nRequests for comment sent to North Korean officials in New York were not answered.\n\nSteven Perles, an attorney who has won billion-dollar Foreign Soverign Immunities Act judgments for victims of terror attacks, said these cases are brought not for the money, but for the \"deterrent value.\"\n\n\"It's not about enriching the Warmbiers here. Nothing can bring their son back, nothing can compensate them,\" Perles said. \"But if they can really take money away from the North Koreans, maybe the North Koreans or some other would-be bad actor would think twice before doing this to somebody else. That's the only reason you do this.\"\n\nA few hours after Howell's opinion was published, President Donald Trump said Monday afternoon that he had been briefed by his team working on North Korea and he was looking forward to a second summit with Kim. He made no mention of the judgment.\n\n\"Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea -- Progress being made.

She first called Salt Lake City Police on October 13 to say that she had been blackmailed for money, and the dispatcher advised her to talk to University of Utah police.\n\n\"I've contacted them already, I just wanted to talk to you as well,\" McCluskey said. \"Yeah, I was just concerned because I wasn't sure how long they were gonna take.\"\n\nA week later she called Salt Lake City Police again to follow up on the case and said it had been a week since her last update. But again the dispatcher referred her to the school's police, which had jurisdiction over the case.\n\nMcCluskey's parents, Jill and Matthew McCluskey, posted a rebuttal to the review of her case, according to CNN affiliate KUTV . Their rebuttal lays out a number of instances in which University of Utah police failed to properly escalate what, they say, had become an increasingly dangerous situation.\n\n\"We respectfully disagree with the conclusion that Lauren's murder could not have been prevented,\" the parents wrote. \"There were numerous opportunities to protect her during the almost two weeks between the time when our daughter began expressing repeated, elevating and persistent concerns about her situation and the time of her murder.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Hundreds more migrants may be released in El Paso on Christmas, officials say", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/01RxXgoRUMQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Hundreds more migrants are expected to be released in El Paso, Texas, on Christmas Day and Wednesday as the community works to accommodate hundreds already released at a bus station over the last two days, officials said.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dropped off more than 200 undocumented immigrants Sunday night outside a Greyhound bus terminal in El Paso without an apparent plan for housing them, police said.\n\nDozens more were dropped off at the station Monday, according to US Rep.-elect Veronica Escobar, D-Texas.\n\n\"I believe it was around 60 (on Monday), so thankfully it was a more manageable number than the 200 the day before,\" Escobar told CNN.\n\nThe man Escobar is replacing in Congress, US Rep.

This collaboration ensures that migrants who have been processed by ICE do not end up on the streets of El Paso, homeless, hungry and without support.\n\n\"The federal government has an obligation to provide humane, temporary holding facilities for these migrants in their custody until they can be accepted by NGOs like Annunciation House.

Love is a writer and commentator based in Philadelphia. He contributes to publications including Atlanta Black Star, WHYY and Al Jazeera. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The debate over the n-word has returned, as a 2011 video featuring Chris Rock and Louis C.K. discussing the term resurfaced over the weekend. The exchange between the comedians raises questions about the role that white and black people play in perpetuating the n-word and its racist history.\n\nIn the \"Talking Funny\" video clip, Rock and Louis C.K. are accompanied by Ricky Gervais and Jerry Seinfeld. Louis C.K. states that \"when a black guy gets rich, it's countdown to when he's poor again.\" Rock replied, \"He's the blackest white guy I f*cking know.\"\n\n\"You're saying I'm a n****r?\" Louis C.K. asks.\n\n\"Yes, you are the n****rest fucking white man I have ever met,\" Rock replied. Although Louis C.K. and Gervais -- who also used the word -- were amused, Seinfeld appeared uncomfortable, offering that \"I wouldn't use it anywhere,\" seemingly in reference to the n-word.\n\nLouis C.K. then said, referring to himself and Rock, \"we say n****r on stage.\"\n\nThe video clip reminds us that racism remains a complex and challenging part of American life. The n-word, in particular, has a troubling and nuanced past. While racism is something that more people in society need to discuss and address, the n-word is a different story.\n\nIn many ways, the n-word is highly contextualized. On the one hand, the word has been used for hundreds of years as a symbol of repression, a weapon of white slave masters, colonizers and segregationists to dehumanize people of African descent, to make them feel as if they are less than, slaves or simply the \"other.\"\n\nIn short, the word embodies hate and trauma. If you are African-American and a white person has called you the n-word within the context of a racist assault, as I have experienced, you know the feeling of rage that races through your heart -- the sense that you have been violated and denigrated.\n\nOn the other hand, some black people have seized ownership of a tool of oppression and turned it on its head -- taking a word that symbolizes racial hatred and degradation, and rebranding it as a gesture of love and respect. Think of comedian Larry Wilmore at the 2016 White House Correspondents Dinner, when he called President Barack Obama \"my n*gga.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to comedians. Comedians generally enjoy more leeway on race and other controversial issues, as their art often becomes a powerful tool to illuminate subjects in ways that other professions are unable.\n\nStill, using the n-word is fraught with danger for white comedians, in particular. Take Bill Maher , who used the word on his HBO talk show during a 2017 interview with Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. When Sasse told Maher, \"We'd love to have you work in the fields with us\" in Nebraska, Maher responded, \"Work in the fields? Senator, I'm a house n*****.\" Maher apologized the following week, with Ice Cube on hand to take him to the woodshed for an intervention. Ice Cube explained why Maher's use of the word was a problem. \"It's like a knife, man. You can use it as a weapon or you can use it as a tool. ... It's not cool because when I hear my homie say it, it don't feel like venom. When I hear a white person say it, it feel(s) like that knife stabbing you, even if they don't mean to.\"\n\nAlso appearing on the show was Symone Sanders, former press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who weighed in on Maher's use of the term \"house n*****\" as being offensive to black women. \"As a white person in America, you would've been the master, the slave owner. ... It was mostly black women who were enslaved in the house, who were raped, who were beaten daily, day in and day out,\" Sanders said . \"They endured physical and mental abuse. For a lot of people in America, that was like slap in the face to the black community, particularly to black women.\"\n\nBecause of the history of the n-word, and because we live in a world where certain groups of white people continue to use it to objectify black people, the word is off limits to white people -- yes, even comedians. It's a point that Seinfeld clearly understood in the video.\n\nBut not all criticism should be reserved for the white comedians. Rock rightly has faced condemnation for failing to call out Louis C.K. For example, Jemele Hill tweeted , \"I know black folks who are completely comfortable with white people saying the n-word in their presence. Have had to tell a few white folks that I'm not that black person. Still it says something the only person who was uncomfortable was Seinfeld.\"\n\nPerhaps some white people will be confused about the outrage over the n-word, especially when they see Rock and other black people who are seemingly fine with non-white people using it, but they should remember that in general -- and this part is key -- black people have told white people they no longer have the right or \"privilege\" to use America's most potent, racially-charged and baggage-laden word.\n\nWe live in a nation that fails to educate the public and address the racism that gave birth to it, so even in the safe space of comedy, free speech has limitations, and consequences in the public sphere. If black people are telling you it's not only not funny but deeply offensive, perhaps you should listen.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI agree that Rock should not have participated in the n-word laugh fest. In fact, he should have used the occasion as a teachable moment -- to school his fellow white comedians on their misguided ways. He should have said that it's problematic for white people to use the n-word because it denigrates people of color and stirs up a painful history, and perhaps even more frighteningly, the prospect of a painful future.\n\nBecause one thing is clear: if black people aren't their own advocates, few others will be."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump wallows in his woes during Christmas Day talk with troops", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/y8M7_Uhupjg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In President Donald Trump's Christmas Day telling, the drugs are flowing over the border, the Federal Reserve is imperiling the economy and the Democrats are preparing to harass him with oversight requests.\n\n\"It's a disgrace, what's happening in our country,\" Trump fumed, seated behind the Resolute Desk on Tuesday, after decrying Democrats as hypocrites and recalling -- unprompted -- his firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\n\n\"But other than that,\" he said, his hands gesturing outward, \"I wish everybody a very merry Christmas.\"\n\nIf most Americans were taking a break from their workplace woes on Christmas morning, the President was wallowing in them, even as he worked to project a festive demeanor amid a partial government shutdown and troubling economic news.\n\nCelebrating the holiday at the White House instead of his Palm Beach estate, Trump used a phone call session with American troops to advance his case for a border wall, his isolationist foreign policy views and his insistence that his campaign did not collude with Russia.\n\nTrump acknowledged the standoff with Democrats over funding for his long-promised border wall has no foreseeable end date.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it,\" he said.\n\nAs uniformed servicemen were beamed into the Oval Office via satellite from US bases in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar -- but not war zones like Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria -- Trump said he was pleased to see rich nations like Qatar -- \"There are many, many ways of pronouncing it,\" Trump observed of the Gulf nation -- chipping in for regional security efforts.\n\n\"It will be nice when we can ask for a lot less money for our military,\" Trump said, without referring specifically to recent decisions to draw down troops in Syria and Afghanistan. \"We're, right now, the policemen of the world and we're paying for it. And we can be the policemen of the world, but other countries have to help us.\"\n\nAnd though he expressed confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who spooked investors on Monday by making public his calls with bank CEOs to check on their liquidity, Trump again faulted the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates too quickly, worrying investors and causing stocks to tumble. He insisted the market was ripe for buyers.\n\n\"I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy,\" he said. \"Really a great opportunity to buy.\"\n\nTrump has spent the past several days cooped up in the White House, leaving only on Christmas Eve for an evening service at the National Cathedral. Originally planning to spend the holiday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump canceled the trip after the partial government shutdown went into effect.\n\nHe's the first president to spend Christmas at the White House in 18 years; the last was Bill Clinton in 2000. George W. Bush spent the holiday at Camp David during his eight years in office, while Barack Obama traveled to his native Hawaii.\n\n\"I love the White House, but I wasn't able to be with my family. I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family, my family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting,\" Trump explained on Tuesday -- speaking presumably about his adult children, since first lady Melania Trump returned to the White House on Monday to spend the holiday with him.\n\nHe claimed, without evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall -- and support him in his mission.\n\n\"Many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall,\" he claimed, though didn't identify who the workers were.\n\nHe insisted in lengthy remarks the prolonged shutdown was the fault of Democrats, and repeated his demands a border barrier be funded before the government can reopen. In a sign the deadlock will continue, Trump announced he would travel to Texas in late January to observe part of the wall being built.\n\nBut he did not offer any new method of getting Democrats to sign off on funding, beyond saying he was always willing to meet with Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer and the presumed incoming House speaker, Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Instead, he decried his political opponents as preparing for \"presidential harassment\" once they gain control of the House in January.\n\n\"We know how to handle that,\" Trump said. \"I know how to handle that better than anybody.\"\n\nDescribing the opposing party as hypocrites for what he claimed was onetime support for a border wall, Trump transitioned sharply into a screed on Comey, who he fired early in his term.\n\n\"Everybody hated Comey, they thought he did a horrible job. The Democrats hated him. They were calling for his resignation. They were calling for his firing,\" Trump said. Some Democrats faulted Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Later, Trump's firing of Comey was viewed by many Democrats as a way to short-circuit the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\n\"Once I fired him, everybody said, 'Oh, why did you fire him, why did you fire him?'\" Trump said, waving his hands in irritation."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says no end to shutdown until border barrier funded", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/MKdAoqfllUc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday the government won't reopen until funding is secured for his border barrier, and he plans to go to the border in January to visit a new stretch of wall.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open.

Both sides seem entrenched in their opposing stances and it's possible parts of the government could remain closed until the new Congress is seated in the first week of January, when Democrats will take control of the House.\n\nTrump repeated a claim made a day earlier -- without explanation -- that he'd recently approved 115 miles worth of border barrier.

In a shortened Christmas Eve session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 600 points after a bizarre attempt by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday to calm investors by consulting with the CEOs of top banks backfired . Losses were compounded by another of Trump's Twitter attacks on the Federal Reserve -- following revelations that he has asked if he can legally fire the independent central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nThe Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n\nTrump turns to Twitter while \"all alone\" in the White House\n\nWhile many Americans gathered with their families and with his vacation to the \"Winter White House\" at Mar-a-Lago iced by the shutdown, the President spent the day at the White House blasting critics -- including Democrats who have refused his demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that shuttered the government at midnight on Friday.\n\n\"I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\" Trump wrote in what may have been a tongue in cheek tone in his 10th tweet of the day.\n\nEventually Trump wouldn't be so alone in the executive mansion -- first lady Melania Trump, who decamped to Florida before the shutdown took hold, rejoined the President in Washington Monday night to speak with children who called to track Santa's flight around the world. During those calls, Trump asked one 7-year-old child , \"Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7 it's marginal, right?\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the President lashed out at Brett McGurk, his special envoy for eradicating ISIS, who followed Defense Secretary James Mattis by resigning in protest at Trump's hurriedly announced Syria withdrawal. He hit out at \"Little Bob Corker,\" the outgoing Tennessee senator who has criticized him over Syria and the shutdown. He also insisted he did like allies -- but said many took advantage of the US \"both in 'Military Protection and Trade...' \"\n\nA senior administration official told CNN's Jim Sciutto that national security decision-making has \"basically stopped working\" and decisions are \"made on a whim on phone calls.\" The official added the Syria withdrawal was \"a complete reversal\" and it was done \"without deliberation, no consideration of risks.\"\n\nAmerican allies and partners are \"shocked and totally bewildered\" and the Syrian Democratic Forces \"don't believe this is happening,\" the official said.\n\nIt all added up to a feeling of a White House that is hurtling out of control and a President who is becoming increasingly emotional and vexed at a time when he faces mounting legal and political pressure from special counsel Robert Mueller. He is also days away from a new era of punishing Democratic oversight when the new Congress convenes in early January.\n\nThe loss of Mattis -- who was seen around the world as a check on Trump's erratic national security decision-making -- has raised anxiety about his presidency to previously unmatched levels.\n\nOf course, many Trump supporters voted for disruption and to rattle the Washington establishment when they sent him to the White House so are likely to be less concerned than Washington insiders about the febrile Christmas mood.\n\nBut the President's irascible temper is also detracting from his top achievements at the end of the year, including low unemployment and a strong economy despite market turmoil. The passage of a groundbreaking criminal justice bill has also been overshadowed and there is little talk about his most enduring legacy win -- the new majority he and the Senate GOP engineered on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe President seemed to have his loyal base in mind by engineering a shutdown drama that appears to have no easy exits, but allows him to make a political stand cheered on by the conservative media.\n\n\"AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!\" he tweeted at one point on Monday, likely with those voters in mind.\n\n\"Hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm\"\n\nBut the frenetic Christmas Eve spectacle was stunning even by the President's standards, and prompted the two top Democratic leaders, the likely House speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to issue a joint statement.\n\n\"It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve -- after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,\" the statement said.\n\nAs the shutdown lumbered through its third day, with no end in sight, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas arrived to gavel in the chamber for a pro-forma session that only exemplified the lack of action between the White House and Democrats towards a resolution. He resorted to quoting the earthy wisdom of a former Senate majority leader and President to capture the sense of futility and political dislocation.\n\n\"LBJ said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hailstorm and just take it. That's about where we are,\" he said.\n\nBut in one sign that the festive spirit can triumph over Washington's humbug, the National Parks Service announced the reopening of the National Christmas Tree, thanks to support from the National Park Foundation -- a group of philanthropic organizations and donors.\n\nThe popular Yuletide tourist spot had been closed after a man tried to climb the tree and damaged it. The government shutdown then prevented the National Park Service from reopening it.\n\nThe shutdown is the third this year and has sent hundreds of thousands of federal employees home for Christmas unsure about their upcoming paychecks.\n\nAt the same time, the stock market is careening south with much of the blame being put on the confusion coming from Washington.\n\nMnunchin has had to reassure investors Trump won't fire Powell and left major bank CEOs \"totally baffled\" with a weekend call asking them about the state of their businesses. More criticism from Trump toward the Fed sent markets reeling Monday, as the Dow closed down 653 points before shutting up shop early for Christmas Eve.\n\nMnuchin's intervention was just the latest development that sparked uncertainty in the days running up to the holiday.\n\nA surprise announcement that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery for cancerous growths on her lung added to the frenetic mood in Washington, as the Supreme Court dealt a blow to Trump by knocking back his new restrictions on asylum seekers who cross the southern border.\n\nAnd more mystery is brewing in the highest court in the land after Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused an order holding an unnamed, foreign-government owned company in contempt over a court case related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nIt all adds up to a Christmas that is feeling less and less merry and bright on Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump: Democratic oversight of my administration could amount to 'presidential harassment'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/GJKJN4C_Vpk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Democratic attempts at oversight in the coming Congress could amount to \"presidential harassment.\"\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office, Trump again denied any collusion between his team and Russia when he was questioned about the investigative powers Democrats will assume come January.\n\n\"It's probably presidential harassment and we know how to handle that.

She estimates that based on postings by parents, as many as 1 in 10 children were told that the paralysis was all in their heads when they first sought medical care.\n\nExperts who study the art and science of diagnosis say the problem goes beyond this one rare disease. They say that in general, when presented with a puzzling disease, physicians too often leap to a diagnosis of a psychiatric problem.\n\n\"Mental disorders become the default position to deal with medical uncertainty,\" said Dr. Allen Frances, former chair of psychiatry at the Duke University School of Medicine. \"It's widespread, and it's dangerous.\"\n\nDr. Mark Graber, president emeritus of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, added, \"It's a tendency that physicians have when they can't find a physical cause.\n\n\"It's bad.

He diagnosed Bailey with a mental condition called conversion disorder\n\nSheehan told the doctor off.\n\nBailey Sheehan was diagnosed with AFM after her mother disagreed with an initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I said, 'You've been with my child for 15 minutes, and you think it's psychological? Get out of my face,' \" she remembered.\n\nSheehan said the doctor hinted that she was unstable.\n\n\"He said, you know, 'moms with new babies don't get enough sleep,' \" she said.\n\nBailey's regular pediatrician, who'd known the girl since birth, disagreed with the diagnosis and pushed for further testing. That's when the MRI showed that she had AFM.\n\nArmed with the correct diagnosis, Bailey received treatment for AFM, including extensive physical therapy, and four years later is walking again.\n\n\"We were lucky that her pediatrician was such an advocate for us, but I don't know if everyone's that lucky,\" Sheehan said.\n\nSheehan says she understands why doctors didn't immediately think of AFM for her daughter, because the disease was not well-known four years ago. But there are several other causes of paralysis in children, and she wonders why her daughter didn't get a full round of testing for those.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist who's seen cases of AFM across the country, said that even this year, when AFM has made headlines nationally, parents have told him that doctors have missed the disease and suggested that their children were faking their paralysis.\n\n\"The stories I can tell are maddening and saddening,\" said Greenberg, associate professor of neurology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nFour years later, Sheehan says, she still feels the scars from her daughter's misdiagnosis.\n\n\"You feel violated and wrongly accused,\" she said.\n\nThe dangers of false certainty\n\nThough there's no data indicating how frequently doctors misdiagnose physical conditions as psychiatric ones, experts in the field of diagnosis say they see it all too often.\n\nIt typically starts when a patient has a perplexing illness and doctors feel a need to come up with a diagnosis.\n\n\"Doctors are uncomfortable with not having answers,\" Frances said.\n\nThe consequences can be \"catastrophic,\" he said, because a misdiagnosis can lead to a patient receiving treatment for a disease they don't have and missing out on treatment for the disease they do have.\n\n\"False certainty is much more dangerous than uncertainty,\" he said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians declined requests for comment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGraber, who is also professor emeritus of medicine at the Stony Brook University in New York, said part of the problem is that medical students are taught that physical symptoms sometimes have a psychological basis.

This brings the number of illnesses to 216 people across 38 states since the outbreak began in November 2017.

The illnesses occurred between April 2017 and this November, but nearly half of the illnesses began in October and last month. Five patients have been hospitalized, and one person died.\n\n\"Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to raw turkey and raw chicken products has been identified as the likely source of the outbreak,\" a public health notice from the agency said. \"Many of the individuals who became sick reported eating different types of turkey and chicken products before their illnesses occurred.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, the cases in Canada have the same strain of salmonella as those in the US outbreak.\n\nHealth investigators have identified the outbreak strain of salmonella in samples of raw turkey pet food, raw turkey products and live turkeys, the CDC said.\n\nThe recalled raw ground turkey products were produced at Jennie-O's Faribault, Minnesota, facility between October 22 and October 23. The recalled packages are marked on the side with establishment number P-579 and were sold in 1-pound, 2.5-pound and 3-pound packages.\n\nOn November 15 , the company issued a recall of more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products from its Barron, Wisconsin, facility.\n\nPatients who were interviewed by outbreak investigators reported buying a variety of different brands of raw turkey products from many different stores. \"A single, common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified that could account for the whole outbreak,\" the CDC said.

He called it a much wider problem across the industry, even without the ongoing outbreak. \"We know the issue of salmonella isn't specific to us,\" he said.\n\nState health officials in Arizona and Michigan identified salmonella bacteria in unopened packages of Jennie-O ground turkey from the homes of two patients with salmonella illness. This bacteria was \"closely related genetically\" to the bacteria from the patients. \"This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating turkey,\" the CDC said.\n\nLykken said, \"As always, turkey remains safe to consume when handled and prepared properly. Jennie-O has information available on its website with step-by-step instructions on how to safely prepare and enjoy turkey.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers should not eat any recalled products and should take steps to prevent salmonella illness. That includes washing hands and thoroughly cooking turkey to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, as measured by a food thermometer. Washing raw turkey is not recommended because it can spread germs.

Many of these young boys \"don't have fathers that are present.\"\n\n\"We see quite a lot of femicide [killing of a woman or girl] in South Africa,\" he explained.

This involves having open debates around self-awareness, exploring how the men behave and how they carry themselves. They learn that \"you are not less of a man if you say 'I am sorry,'\" said Chabalala.\n\n\"We play board games, Scrabble, chess. We also try to make it fun.\"\n\nThese safe spaces have now been rolled out in schools and other community venues such as local churches and gardens in the town.\n\nAccording to Chabalala, the Young Men Movement is a direct response to the crisis of masculinity today as societal norms, such as those around sexuality, demand conflicting behaviors from men.\n\n\"We expect girls to hold on to their virginity for quite some time and for boys to sow their seeds, forgetting that for them to actually lose their virginity, they are sleeping with another girl,\" he said.\n\nThey are accused of not being manly enough because they are 16, 18 or 19 years old and haven't had sex, Chabalala explains.\n\nA boy takes part in a \"walk a mile in her shoes\" march protesting violence against women in Gugulethu in 2016.\n\nHe says that teaching men to \"respect women\" is a crucial part of the group's aim.\n\n\"It's about working on the liberation of their thinking, them accepting certain concepts in a more progressive way,\" he said, adding that most men can't open up about these things with family or friends.\n\nAlpheus Atjil, now a 19-year-old agricultural science student at the University of Pretoria, 50 miles away, has been coming to meetings in Pankop since they launched in 2015. He says he joined because most of his friends attended group meetings, but he has since found them invaluable.\n\n\"You cannot talk to your parents about such things,\" said Atjil referring to relationships, and for whom the group is a brotherhood.\n\nThe group has helped facilitate those discussions among peers, he says. He's moved to campus in Pretoria but still tries to attend meetings once a month.\n\n'What it is to be a man'\n\nIn research, hegemonic masculinity -- toxic masculinity -- concerns those things that describe what it is to be a man, often things that are bad, violent or aggressive, says Malose Langa, associate professor of psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nMen say that in order \"to be celebrated, you need to be tough; you need to be emotionless.\"\n\nGoing against this, \"trying to be different,\" is not an easy path, he said. \"Such voices are not known, are not popular. They are not celebrated.\"\n\nBut this culture can't be easily corrected, Langa believes. \"There needs to be space, but it depends who is facilitating those conversations and what are the messages.\"\n\nHe says apartheid is partly to blame for the way young black men in South Africa have learned to socialize. \"With our history, prior to 1994, you needed to know how to use a gun, and post-1994, many young men struggle to get out of those identities.\"\n\nMen take part in the \"Not In My Name\" march in 2017, in Pretoria against sexual abuse and violence towards women.\n\nReducing crime\n\nRape culture is ever-present in South Africa, with an estimated 138 of every 100,000 women in the country having been raped in 2016 and 2017, according to recent data from Statistics South Africa\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA 2016 study found that parental absence, bullying and harassment were associated with men who commit rape.\n\nAtjil believes that many \"boys and men who are the perpetrators didn't have leaders and men to lead them on the right path.\"\n\nThe Young Men Movement is trying to change this, by educating men against violence toward women.\n\nRebecca Helman, a researcher at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and the South African Medical Research Council-UNISA's Violence, Injury, and Peace Research Unit, says \"women are from an early age swiftly molded into being nurturing and caring, but male children are not at all. And then it comes to the point where they become fathers, and we are surprised when they just opt out.\"\n\nHelman often conducts surveys with men about masculinity and says she knows too well the effects of toxic masculinity. She was raped three years ago and has used the experience to dedicate her time to changing attitudes.\n\n\"He was a young guy. He was high on drugs, and I don't even know how old he was. He may have been 17 or 18. He said, 'why are you crying?' and I said, 'do you think this is nice for me?'\" she recalled.\n\n\"I don't know if this was what triggered it, but he stopped with the rape, and you could see he was quite distressed with what he had done.\"\n\nShe says she immediately went to the police and reported the rape, but her attacker was never caught. If he had been caught, she said, he would very likely \"experience the same violence in prison.\"\n\n'Calling out other young men'\n\nHelman believes that community based groups like the Young Men Movement need to work together to create spaces of engagement.\n\n\"Young men really need to be calling out other young men,\" she said. \"But what happens once those men leave the safe space? Because a lot of the research shows that there is a high cost to being a different kind of man.\"\n\nChabalala admits, \"things are not going to change overnight,\" and says the group is very slowly \"reconstructing how men socialize\" in their environment.\n\nEach member takes turns to host meetings in their homes and some now have different group branches at soccer practice and in their church, he explained.\n\nThe Young Men Movement now runs projects across Pretoria about providing support networks and learning together, including a book club at which members meet twice a month and discuss books and insights gained from reading.\n\nToday, the group discussions are extending beyond masculinity, to learning and skills development to also provide a future for these men.\n\n\"At my school, we used old-fashioned pen and paper,\" Atjil said. \"In our village, most people don't experience a lot of things, simple things like computers. The group prepared me for that at university.\"\n\nAtjil who comes from a rural community in Pankop says the vital life skills he has learned from Young Men Movement has allowed him to adjust to city life in Pretoria, and in the future for work and relationships."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Hawaii named healthiest state, Louisiana ranks last in new report", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/3pAvFeIyZdg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the new year approaches, many people focus on improving their health -- but how does where you live rank when it comes to health?\n\nHawaii now ranks as the healthiest state in America, beating out Massachusetts to return to the top spot in a new report by the United Health Foundation , a nonprofit division of UnitedHealth Group , which also owns the insurance company United Healthcare and Optum.\n\nHawaii, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Utah are the five healthiest states of the year, while the five least healthy are Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and, coming in last, Louisiana, according to the annual America's Health Rankings report, released last week.\n\nThe report has been conducted annually for the past 29 years.\n\n\"A rank means that you overall are healthier than the states below you in the rank and are overall less healthy than the states above you in the rank,\" said Dr. Rhonda Randall, chief medical officer of UnitedHealthcare National Markets and a senior adviser to the America's Health Rankings report.\n\n\"The report provides a benchmark of how the health of each state's population has changed year over year, by comparison to other states, and insights into challenges and successes. The states that are in the top five on the list have areas where they could improve. The states that are in the bottom five have areas that they have done well,\" she said. \"So every state has some areas where they're challenged and some areas where they have some really strong measures around their health.\"\n\nLast year, the five healthiest states were the same but in different order: Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont, Utah and Connecticut. The least healthy last year were West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Previously, Hawaii had a five-year reign as healthiest state.\n\n'Obesity has hit an all-time high'\n\nTo create the rankings, the report takes into account 35 health factors and examines them by state.\n\nThose 35 measures fall into categories: \"the behaviors that we are choosing in our lifestyle; the community and environment where we live; the public policy that happens at a state level; and the clinical care that we receive when we go to the doctor and the hospital ultimately influence the outcomes around our health,\" Randall said.\n\n\"A scientific advisory committee looks at each one of those measures and determines, based on scientific evidence, how much of an impact that measure has on the overall health of a population,\" she said. \"Then, the states get a ranking for each individual measure, and then they get an overall ranking.\"\n\nThe data in the report also provided a snapshot of the nation's overall health, which Randall said revealed both concerning and encouraging trends.\n\n\"Starting with the thing that concerned us the most, obesity has hit an all-time high. The obesity rate in America for the adult population, for the first time in the history of producing this report, is up 5% in the past year. It hit 31.3% for 2018,\" Randall said.\n\nIn other words, nearly one in three US adults is obese.\n\nObesity rates also appeared to be high in many of the states ranked as least healthy. For instance, the prevalence of obesity in West Virginia is 38.1%, nearly double the prevalence in Colorado, where it is 22.6%, according to the report.\n\n\"Another thing that concerns us that we found in this report was that premature death increased 3% in the past year. That means years of life lost before people are reaching the age of 75,\" Randall said.\n\n\"That often has correlation with a number of factors -- things like our lifestyle choices, living with more chronic diseases,\" she said. \"We also know that the suicide rate has increased as well, and that would contribute to the increase in premature death rate, along with other causes.\"\n\nThe report measured the suicide rate as the number of deaths due to intentional self-harm per 100,000 deaths recorded on death certificates, and the data showed that America's suicide rate has increased 16% since 2012.\n\nJUST WATCHED CDC: US life expectancy drops, suicides rise Replay More Videos ...

That childhood poverty measure decreased 6% since the prior year,\" she said.\n\n\"We're also seeing there are more mental health providers available than in prior years,\" she said. \"That measure looks at mental health providers of all degrees, so it looks at psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health professionals, marriage and family therapists as examples, and so that number has increased nationally.\"\n\nWhat's behind the state-by-state differences\n\nSome of the state-by-state differences in the rankings could be explained by social determinants of health, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines social determinants as the complex social structures and economic systems that can drive most health inequities, such as access to health care or education.\n\n\"If you think about the things that cause premature death -- heart disease, perinatal deaths, tobacco-related diseases -- in many ways, those are spurred by social determinants,\" Benjamin said.\n\nFor instance, \"Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana continue to be at the bottom, and that kind of carries up to the Arkansas and Tennessee region. When you look at some of the challenges they have, it's still around tobacco use and poverty and, to some degree, physical inactivity,\" he said. \"Those are the things that we know result in fundamentally poor health outcomes.

As an example, the smoking trend in the United States has come down consistently over the 29 years of this report.

Fact. Why?\n\nSince records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.\n\nIn not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth.\n\nIn 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000.\n\nAnd that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years.\n\nIn fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal.\n\nIt is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable.\n\nMore surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century.\n\nBut why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories.\n\nIt's all about evolution\n\nThe first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born.\n\nThat is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems.\n\n\"At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,\" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford.\n\nSo more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes.\n\nIn fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer.\n\nSperm and timing\n\nThere are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg.\n\nThese include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position.\n\nOne popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Male sperm are the best swimmers but female sperm live longer\n\nConversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced.\n\nParents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.\n\nThere is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions.\n\nSurvival in the womb\n\nIf planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on gender, then could something else be happening during pregnancy?\n\nIf there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand.\n\nSome research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths.\n\nScientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why.\n\nWhat we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Spinal surgery for unborn babies

the NHS for the first time from April.\n\nMore than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.\n\nIt often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties.\n\nThe condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility.\n\nSpinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College

executive of charity Shine, said: \"Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress.\"\n\n'Life-changing treatment'\n\nAmong the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex

Every variety of chestnut is affected.\"\n\nOver the last three years since the infestation first arrived in the area, countless trees have died. Over the generations each plot of land, or finca, has been divided between offspring with the chestnut proving the most lucrative of all the crops.\n\nAlthough cork and other trees grow in abundance, most farmers depend on chestnuts that are exported to France for specialist processing.\n\nIn order to limit the damage, some farmers are burning the infected trees to protect those who aren't affected. \"This is increasing the risk of forest fires,\" says Antonio Pulido.\n\n\"It is also adding to urban drift as young people in the villages see their future disappearing in front of their eyes.\"\n\nImage copyright Richard Duebel Image caption Here, sweet chestnuts are prepared at a local restaurant.

Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings.\"\n\nIt's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community.\n\n\"I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,\" he explained.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Apollo 8 astronauts prepare for launch\n\nHis former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic.\n\n\"I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,\" he told 5 Live. \"I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that.\"\n\nBut asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary.\n\n\"I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense.\"\n\nApollo's legacy\n\nReflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a \"great endeavour\" and agreed that it had won the space race.\n\nAnders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be \"Earthrise\" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: \"When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose here\u2026 it sort of dawned me,\" he said.\n\n\"And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform.

One is the Emirati Ahmed Mansoor jailed for 10 years, the other the Bahraini Nabeel Rajab jailed for five. I know both men and am proud to call them friends. The fact that their appeals will be heard at a time when the attention of the West will be otherwise engaged in festive celebrations is no coincidence. Rather, it is a cynical ploy.\n\nThe authorities in both countries would much prefer that the outcome of the appeals is largely ignored. Both myself and the many human rights organisations that follow their cases fear that the appeals will be dismissed. The justice systems in both the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain are highly politicised and have no real independence from the ruling families.\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about Ahmed Mansoor and Nabeel Rajab and the extraordinary courage they and their families have shown over years of harassment, arrests and imprisonment.\n\nAlthough they have campaigned always peacefully for free media, freedom of expression and association and for democratic reform, they have been treated as security threats by their governments when, in fact, they are great patriots.\n\nAhmed Mansoor, the father of four young children, was the winner of the prestigious 2015 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders. He once joked with me that he was \"the last man talking\" in the UAE and the region about human rights violations. He pretty much was. Almost every other activist in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is in jail, in exile or silenced by the fear of what the authorities will do not only to them but also to their loved ones.\n\nAhmed and his family have paid a heavy price for his human rights advocacy.\n\nIn early 2011, after signing a petition calling for democratic and economic reforms, he was subjected to an online smear campaign which, he told me, was orchestrated by the state security apparatus. \"Twitter, Facebook, text messages, television and radio spread false information about me to create an environment of hatred,\" he said. It was a campaign that included many death threats.\n\nIn April of that year, he was arrested, held in jail for nearly eight months and convicted, together with three other human rights proponents, of \"insulting the rulers\" in a trial that was widely seen as grossly unfair.\n\nOn November 27, 2011, Ahmed was sentenced to three years in jail. The next day, thanks largely to an international outcry, he and the others sentenced with him were pardoned.\n\nBy the time he was released, he had already lost his job as a senior engineer in a telecommunications firm. Subsequently, the government refused to issue him a Certificate of Good Conduct, citing his conviction. Without the certificate, he couldn't be employed in either the private or public sectors. His passport was confiscated and he was banned from travel, a ban which the authorities refused to lift so he could receive the Martin Ennals Award in person in Geneva.\n\nThen, in March of 2017, he was seized and taken to an unknown place. His family had no idea where he was and had virtually no contact with him. He was denied access to a lawyer of his choosing. Nearly a year after he was taken, he was brought to court, sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined one million dirham ($272,300) after being convicted of \"insulting the 'status and prestige of the UAE and its symbols' including its leaders\" and of \"seeking to damage the relationship of the UAE with its neighbours by publishing false reports and information on social media.\"\n\nNabeel Rajab, whom I have known since 2007, was arrested in June 2016 and held on remand for more than a year and a half, much of that time in solitary confinement. In February of this year, he was brought to trial, swiftly found guilty and handed the five-year term. He was convicted of \"disseminating false rumours in time of war\", for \"offending a foreign country\" and for \"insulting a statutory body\" for tweets critical of the war in Yemen and for the mistreatment of detainees in Bahrain's Jau prison.\n\nNabeel had already spent several years in and out of jail for his persistent refusal to cease his peaceful criticism of the extensive human rights abuses of the Bahraini regime. Like Ahmed Mansoor, he understood that to continue the journey for freedom and democratic reform would inevitably mean more jail time. He had a small bag packed by the door, waiting either for the midnight raid to take him away or for the morning phone call instructing him to present himself at the office of the public prosecutor.\n\nLike Ahmed's family, Nabeel's family - his brave wife Sumaya and their children - have suffered greatly. His son Adam has courageously carried on the struggle to keep his father's name in the public domain.\n\nIn all the time I have known Nabeel, he has never once doubted that his cause was rightful, nor that the justice must be obtained through peaceful means. He fears that constant harassment and ongoing repression by the state will lead only to more violence. As he told me once:\n\n\"There is no place for peaceful protest. All marches are banned and you can't talk on Twitter. There is no tolerance for any criticism. The government is filling the jails with human rights activists and opposition politicians, all of us advocates for peaceful change.\"\n\nHe also once told me that the authorities had offered him his release with only one condition: that he ceases and desists from criticising the regime. He told me those were not terms he could ever contemplate accepting.\n\nAnd I remember asking Ahmed why he continued on his lonely fight. He said: \"The only way to counter repression is by revealing it. And yes there is always that possibility that I will go back to jail. But if [activists] do not talk, who will?\"\n\nAhmed Mansoor's appeal is scheduled for December 30, Nabeel Rajab's the next day.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump: Shutdown Won't End Until Wall Funded", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reiterates-government-shutdown-will-not-end-until-demand-for-wall-funding-is-met/4715450.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "The partial shutdown of the U.S. government has moved no closer to a resolution, with President Donald Trump asserting on Tuesday the shutdown will continue until his demand for funds to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall are met.\n\n\"I can't tell you when the government is going to be open.

While the daughter has a case for asylum pending, an immigration judge on Friday denied the mother's request to reopen her immigration case.\n\n\n\nShalyn Fluharty, who is managing attorney of the Dilley Pro Bono Project and representing the mother and daughter, said that the teen has tried to take her own life at least once in detention and that she needs her mother.\n\n\n\n\"Her psychological well-being is in a critical state,\" Fluharty said.\n\n\n\nThe mother and daughter were initially allowed out of detention while their immigration cases proceeded, but ICE detained them both in June. The daughter had her 15th birthday in detention last week.\n\n\n\nThe Dilley facility, which has a capacity of 2,400, is used by ICE to hold mothers and daughters together. Fluharty said she had never heard of anyone being detained at Dilley for six months. An agreement known as the Flores settlement bars the prolonged detention of immigrant children.\n\n\n\nFluharty said the teen and her mother fear that she would be sexually assaulted or killed if sent back to Honduras.\n\n\n\nBut if the mother was deported and the daughter kept in the U.S., the teen would likely be placed in a government facility for unaccompanied minors. That's what occurred with hundreds of children earlier this year after their parents were deported under a zero-tolerance immigration policy that led to large-scale family separations.\n\n\n\nMore than 14,000 minors were in government custody last week, many in large, crowded facilities that pediatricians and mental health experts say are unsuitable for children.\n\n\n\n\"That choice is fundamentally unfair and should never be posed to a child,\" Fluharty said.\n\n\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who has visited several facilities in Texas to call attention to immigration detention, met with the detained Honduran mother during a visit to Dilley and has called attention to her and her daughter's case.\n\n\n\nMerkley questioned whether the U.S. government was using the threat of deporting the mother to force the teen to give up her own asylum case.\n\n\n\n\"This is a form of psychological pressure,\" Merkley said Monday. \"We need to have the best interest of the child in mind, and that means not separating her from the mother and not keeping her in prison.\"\n\n\n\nFluharty said she plans to appeal the mother's case Wednesday after the government holiday for Christmas. It's unclear whether immigration courts will be open due to the partial government shutdown that began Saturday.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for ICE said the agency could not comment on the case due to the shutdown.

Posting updates to her department's website, or photocopying missives to send to constituents, she said, was mostly one-sided.\n\nBut after she set up an official Facebook page for Quang Ninh province, the conversations started to flow in both directions, between Chi and the local residents or businesses. That's why, when it comes to social media, she thinks more civil servants need to catch up with the rest of the country.\n\n\"Social media, especially the Facebook application, is really used a lot in Vietnam,\" said Chi, who is deputy head of the province's investment promotion and support office. \"But for public agencies that use it as a tool to interact with people and businesses, it's still not necessarily used a lot.\"\n\nFacebook on charm offensive\n\nEven as governments around the world are demanding more accountability and transparency from Facebook, public officials in Vietnam are looking for more ways to use the website. And Facebook is happy to oblige.\n\nThe company is on something of a charm offensive in Vietnam, where it has roughly 42 million members, nearly half the country. Besides sending top officials to visit Vietnam last year, Facebook has been instructing small businesses on how to sell their products on the site, and now it is giving civil servants like Chi advice for engaging with the public.\n\nThe chance to win some good will in Vietnam comes at a time when pressures are piling up on Facebook both inside the country and abroad. Globally, it has been accused of complicity in plots to convince voters to vote for Brexit or for candidate Donald Trump, as well as in what the United Nations calls ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The company reportedly paid for research that could damage its critics' and competitors' reputations, as well as gave users' data to dozens of other firms without consent.\n\nNew cyber law\n\nIn Vietnam, the government told advertisers to boycott Facebook and other sites in response to users' postings that criticized the one-party state. Next month, the country will enact a cyber law requiring firms to store data domestically, which Facebook opposes.\n\nBut those troubles were not front and center at a workshop in Ho Chi Minh City this month where a company representative gave bureaucrats tips on making a Facebook page.\n\n\"We have to understand and put more attention to the social aspect of the platform,\" said Noudhy Valdryno, who handles government outreach for Facebook. \"That means you have to understand your followers, who are they, where do they live, what are their interests? Then you can formulate an accurate strategy to engage with your followers.\"\n\nThe workshop included suggestions for government officials, such as posting updates on Facebook at regular intervals, shooting videos vertically to retain the attention of mobile users, and encouraging conversations among followers on the page.\n\nTech companies welcome\n\nThe event was an example of how Vietnamese officials are open to working with the tech company. It is so ubiquitous in the Southeast Asian country that when Vietnamese people say \"social media\" they mean Facebook, and when asked what newspapers they read, they give the answer: Facebook.\n\n\"What we're talking about is effective use of technology in this day and age to achieve our goals,\" said Le Quoc Cuong, vice director of the Ho Chi Minh City department of information and communications. \"What we're looking for is being effective, being engaging and enhancing cooperation between the government and the people.\"\n\nChi says more Facebook data would help her better engage with residents around Quang Ninh, a northeastern province that hugs the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Chinese border on another. She would like regular reports, perhaps every month, with information to help analyze the province's fan page, from key words to number of \"likes.\" So as many people worldwide have begun to decry tech companies for abusing and cashing in on users' data, there are those who still continue to see untapped potential in gathering further data."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "US SpaceX First National Security Mission", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-spacexfirst-national-security-mission/4713597.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSpaceX continues making news in 2018.

And a conversation with Erdogan on Dec. 14 was central to Trump\u2019s Syria move, The Associated Press reported, after Erdogan asked why U.S. forces still needed to be in the country, given the success of efforts against the ISIS insurgency there. Trump\u2019s sudden agreement on that point caught Erdogan \u201coff guard,\u201d according to the AP, and Trump quickly directed top aides to start arranging a drawback \u2015 a policy shift that almost no one in his national security circle supported and that led to the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and top State Department official Brett McGurk.\n\nIt\u2019s true that bombing and ground support for local partners by the U.S. and allies since 2014 has drastically shrunk the ISIS presence, which mushroomed amid Syria\u2019s civil war. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s political rise and presidency have been associated with politically popular criticism of U.S. intervention abroad \u2015 this is something he can say he has delivered on to his voters \u2015 and he has received some praise for the decision from detractors of the national security establishment like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nBut critics of the decision have gained traction by highlighting the rushed way it seems to have been made over the objections of Trump\u2019s advisers, and the Sunday message helps them by suggesting that he is to at least degree being guided by his long-running fixation with strongmen. Using \u201cstrongly\u201d and saying Erdogan \u201cis a man who can do it\u201d echoes Trump\u2019s previous niceties about the Turkish president, who has jailed dozens of journalists, and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2015 and hints more at a feeling than a sober national security assessment.\n\nFrom a strategic viewpoint, betting on Erdogan in such a big way is risky. His priorities in Syria don\u2019t neatly align with those of the U.S.: While Washington prioritized weakening ISIS, he helped with that fight but was largely fixated on Kurdish militants who also became stronger as Syria fell into chaos. American policymakers have been supporting the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, which Erdogan dislikes and is ideologically linked to a rebel group that has battled the Turkish government for decades. For him, taking on a larger role in Syria will likely mean trying to curtail the Kurds\u2019 power.\n\nAdditionally, Erdogan\u2019s past relationship with ISIS is murky. While his government has targeted by the group and has cracked down on its networks in Turkey, for years it turned a blind eye to the flow of fighters and money to extremist groups involved in the opposition to Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom Erdogan wanted to see ousted.\n\nThe Turkish leader has softened on Assad but continues to support fighters in Syria who may have turned on the formerly U.S.-backed Kurds. And in the course of adjusting his Syria policy and dealing with other issues like Western criticism of his record on human rights, Erdogan has grown closer and closer to Putin \u2015 a problem for the leader of a NATO member country and another reason U.S. officials are wary of fully following the Turkish lead.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest message will likely only fuel a controversy that now has even commentators close to his administration publicly fretting."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Pakistan's Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Sentenced To 7 Years For Corruption", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pakistans-former-prime-minister-sharif-sentenced-to-7-years-for-corruption_us_5c20c85ce4b0407e907d3e50", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "ASSOCIATED PRESS Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif arrives to appear in a court in Lahore, Pakistan, on Oct. 8, 2018.\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 An anti-graft tribunal sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to seven years in prison for corruption on Monday, drawing criticism from his party, which said the decision was a \u201cblack spot\u201d on the justice system.\n\nThe verdict came after Sharif was removed from power last year over corruption allegations.

The toy trains were not whirring. Even the nearby bathrooms were locked.\n\nThe national Christmas tree, symbol of a country\u2019s seasonal cheer, instead stood as an icon of a government in paralysis, as the partial shutdown stretched into the holiday with an array of federal services frozen, some 800,000 public servants either idled or about to be and the disruption to the broader public bound to grow when the quiet spell ends later this week.\n\nAlready facilities at many national parks were shuttered, if the parks were accessible at all, and thousands of federal buildings were to remain closed when the work week resumed unless President Donald Trump and members of Congress quickly break through a budget impasse that the White House said could drag on into 2019.\n\nUnder cloudy skies in a brisk wind on the third day of the shutdown, the capital put on little holiday wonder for visitors like Greg Forcherio of Columbia, Maryland, a government contractor with no office to work in after the holidays as long as federal buildings stayed closed. He, his wife and their toddler on Monday came to see the giant, glittering spruce tree brought from Colorado to serve as the national Christmas tree, normally a focal point for Washington holiday visitors.\n\nBut a locked chain-link fence blocked access to the site and the nearby White House visitor\u2019s center and its bathrooms were closed, with a hand-scrawled sign directing visitors to portable toilets, which also were chained shut. \u201cKind of annoying when you\u2019ve got young children,\u201d Forcherio said.\n\nAccess to the site was restored later Monday and finally, as night fell on Christmas Eve, the lights returned. The government had announced a day earlier that it would be sealed off because of the shutdown and because repairs had slowed after an episode of vandalism on the tree before the weekend. It reopened with money from the National Park Foundation, a charity.\n\nAssociated Press A National Park Service employee closes the gate to visitors at the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse near the White House.\n\nA labor organization representing U.S. Treasury employees said Monday that federal workers around the country were cutting back on spending and changing holiday plans with family because of the shutdown.\n\n\u201cJust in case anyone still thinks a partial shutdown over a holiday weekend is harmless, think again,\u201d Tony Reardon of the National Treasury Employees Union said in a statement. \u201cYour friends and neighbors around the country who work for the federal government are already showing signs of financial stress.\u201c\n\nIn the mountain town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Taylor Futch said the shutdown has already put extra stress on her family, whose sole income comes from her husband, a wildlife biologist who works with black bears for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. With two young daughters, the couple is facing an $800 land payment due at the beginning of January as well as a mortgage, car payment and the usual bills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to gather up a couple things just in case I need to start selling stuff on Facebook or eBay,\u201d she said. \u201cIf his paycheck doesn\u2019t get here on Friday, we may not have enough for the mortgage.\u201c\n\nFederal workers at the agencies affected by the gap in appropriations go unpaid as long as the shutdown lasts. They were expected to get retroactive pay once the impasse was broken.\n\nThe shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some still accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operating with money from states or charitable groups and others locked off. Arizona and Utah officials implemented plans to keep open Grand Canyon, Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks and provide services such as public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.\n\nConcession operations such as lodges remained open, and Utah\u2019s money for parks in that state included visitor centers.\n\nAmong sites closed outright: in the southwest alone, Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified National Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.\n\nOf the roughly 800,000 federal employees facing deferred pay, more than half were deemed essential, such as U.S. Secret Service agents and Transportation Security Administration airport agent. About 380,000 were to be furloughed.\n\nLegislation ensuring that workers receive back pay was expected to clear Congress.\n\nThe immediate impact was blunted by the timing of the shutdown \u2014 spanning a weekend and now Christmas Eve and Christmas, both federal holiday days. But there was little chance to solve anything before Thursday at the earliest, when the House and Senate return to work.\n\nTrump stayed at the White House, canceling plans to spend the holidays in Florida, and kept up a torrent of tweets on Monday about his critics and his insistence on money for a border wall, the issue at the heart of the budget dispute.\n\nNot far from those quarters, Terri Lyons, visiting from Rockville, Maryland, with her 27-year-old daughter as they do every Christmas, found the lights off at one of her favorite monuments, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, when she visited Sunday night.

It\u2019s the most produced, consumed and traded vegetable oil in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), perhaps making a palm oil-free life seem impossible, but its consumption should be on everyone\u2019s radar.\n\nBarcroft Media via Getty Images An illegal palm oil plantation is seen in Aceh, Indonesia, shortly after its creation in June.\n\nThe good news is that many, including the WWF and Greenpeace, believe that it\u2019s possible to produce palm oil responsibly, though all sides appear to admit that there\u2019s still a ways to go.\n\nOne way to help curb palm oil demand is for people to reduce consumption. This can be done by checking ingredient labels, though palm oil is often listed as something else. Another way is to avoid processed foods, because palm oil is often an ingredient in other ingredients. (As a bonus, whole foods are often healthier for you.)\n\nAnother way to help is to purchase products that use sustainably sourced palm oil, many of which are certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and feature its label. Though there are debates on the RSPO\u2019s strength, many argue that it\u2019s wiser to use sustainable palm oil instead of totally boycotting palm oil because the palms produce more oil and require less land to grow than other oils, like rapeseed, sunflower and soybean.\n\nHere is a list of products to help you stay more palm oil-conscious this year.\n\nAle-ks via Getty Images Palm oil helps give chocolate a smooth and shiny appearance.\n\nChocolate\n\nPalm oil helps give chocolate a smooth and shiny appearance and keeps it from melting, making it an extremely popular ingredient, especially in chocolates that have soft or gooey features.\n\nDivine Chocolate is one brand that is not only palm oil free but also takes extra strides to give back to the communities that help produce it.\n\nGhirardelli\u2019s solid chocolate is palm oil free. Its products containing soft fillings may contain palm oil, but the company vows that it will be from sustainable resources.\n\nLindt\u2019s solid chocolate bars are also free of palm oil, opting for 100 percent cocoa butter instead. Its chocolates with fillings, like the Lindor Truffles, use palm oil that is sustainably sourced, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nGodiva also uses sustainably sourced palm oil and is a member of the RSPO.\n\nHershey is another company that has committed to using sustainably sourced palm oil. It has received a high rating from the WWF.\n\nsubjug via Getty Images Palm oil helps make ice cream smooth and creamy.\n\nIce Cream\n\nLike chocolate, palm oil helps make ice cream smooth and creamy.\n\nCoconut Bliss is also free of palm oil, with the organic, non-diary ice cream using coconut to achieve its creamy texture.\n\nCookies And Chips\n\nThe Cookie Department, based in Portland, Oregon, produces cookies that are free of palm oil. Its products are available in stores and online.\n\nPepperidge Farm offers a number of palm oil-free snacks and cookies, including its Sugar Cookies, Lemon Cookies, Chessman Cookies, Milano Milk Chocolate Cookies, Milano Sweet Toffee Cookies and Goldfish crackers (excluding the Goldfish Grahams).

Let\u2019s be realistic: probably not. A new you is a tall order! But by setting a few smart, specific New Year\u2019s resolutions, it\u2019s entirely possible to improve certain areas of your life.\n\n\u201cThe key is to not be too broad,\u201d said Amanda Stemen, the owner of FUNdaMENTALs, a psychotherapy and coaching group in Los Angeles. \u201cYour resolutions need to be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely.\u201d\n\nWith smart goal setting in mind, we asked our readers to tell us the New Year\u2019s resolutions they plan to make for 2019. Below, Stemen and other therapists and life coaches rate how achievable some of those goals are, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 the most achievable.\n\n1. I spend a lot of time on social media, especially Instagram. How do I cut back without dealing with FOMO?\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThe feasibility of this goal depends on the industry this person works in. Many of us have jobs or run businesses in which it\u2019s necessary to stay connected and active on these networks. In that case, pulling back requires some intention and careful goal planning, said Kate Stoddard, an associate marriage and family therapist at Wellspace SF in Northern California.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re someone who likes to post a lot outside of the job, ask yourself why you\u2019re posting and what you want from it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone who likes to scroll endlessly, try making your feed intentional by spending 10 whole seconds on each post and deciding if this is something you want to follow or not.\u201d\n\nIf your job allows, try taking a full social media break from the sites you find particularly addictive and see how you feel.\n\n\u201cFrom there, decide if social media is something that you want to continue using or not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to control how and why you use it, not the other way around.\u201d\n\n2. I\u2019ve been spending too much money on Postmates and other food delivery apps. Next year, I resolve to use those apps less and cook more.\n\nHow achievable it is: 4/5\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a financial strain to initiate some change in our lives, said Ryan Kelly, a psychologist in Charlotte, North Carolina. There are some tangible payouts for this goal, so it\u2019s likely to stick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the stress relief of saving some money and the pride of cooking healthy meals will increase the likelihood of success here,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure you set a specific goal \u2015 for instance, I used to order four times a week, this year I\u2019ll order two times a week \u2015 and plan for food preparation (e.g., shopping list for simple, appetizing meals).\u201d\n\neclipse_images via Getty Images Plan for your meal prep and you'll be less likely to order pricey takeout.\n\n3. I need to be more proactive about my dating life, but I loathe opening the dating apps on my phone. This year, I\u2019m going to be better about following through with matches.\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThis can be a tough one to stick to because it\u2019s so easy to get overwhelmed by the potential matches or feel hopeless that you\u2019re ever going to meet the right person, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who specializes in counseling men. Sometimes, it pays to give yourself a breather from the apps.\n\n\u201cA woman I\u2019m counseling has struggled with the results she\u2019s gotten from dating apps for the past year and has decided to back off and go more old school by trying to meet and get to know people in person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s being more intentional about going to her local market, where she\u2019s had pretty good success, and participating in activities like fun runs and Meetups.\u201d\n\n4. I want to invest more in the friendships that I already have and be a more thoughtful friend. How do I accomplish this without making myself feel like my to-do list is just getting longer?\n\nHow achievable it is: 3/5\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating this one. Keeping up with friends when you already have a frenzied schedule is going to take some effort and intention, said Alena Gerst, a psychotherapist in New York City. Plus, it requires effort from all parties.\n\n\u201cIt takes two to invest in a friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully your friend will be equally interested rejoining forces with you on being more present. If you try a couple of times and your effort is not reciprocated, it\u2019s time for a more heart-to-heart talk or to accept the friendship as is.\u201d\n\nTom Werner via Getty Images Quality time together takes two.\n\n5. In 2019, I would like to start eating more mindfully. Sometimes I eat not because I\u2019m actually hungry but because I\u2019m bored, stressed or in need of a break.\n\nHow achievable it is: 2/5\n\nMindful eating is a great goal, but first you\u2019ll have to dig a little deeper and figure out what\u2019s causing you to feel stressed or bored and to seek relief in the fridge, said May Bartlett, a life coach at Wellspace SF.\n\n\u201cFor the goal of mindful eating to be successful, it needs to be paired with a willingness to shift your relationship with your emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we eat out of boredom or stress, it\u2019s typically a way to escape the sensations that are associated with those emotions. In order to stop the habit of eating when we aren\u2019t hungry, the first step is to be mindful of the sensations we\u2019re trying to avoid and see what happens when we sit with them.\u201d\n\n6. My husband and I are used to mindlessly scrolling through our phones when hanging out. I want 2019 to be filled with more quality time, so I\u2019m resolving to not use my phone during dinner and ask my husband to do the same.\n\nHow achievable it is: 4/5\n\nIf this person\u2019s husband gets on board, this resolution should be a cinch, Kelly said. The difficulty is that smartphones are notoriously rewarding. \u201cOur phones provide a lot of pleasure through dopamine, stress relief by decreasing cortisol and are ingrained in our daily lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems like this person has the resolve, a clearly defined goal (no phones at dinner), and best of all, you have each other. Accountability goes a long way, especially for tough goals. Put your phones in a drawer before you eat (turned off) and hold each other responsible. Do it for each other, if not for yourselves.\u201d\n\n7. I want to bring more excitement into my life and make special memories with my family. Does this necessarily mean I need to spend more money on weekend activities?\n\nHow achievable it is: 5/5\n\n\u201cMoney = fun\u201d is a societal trap that\u2019s way too easy to fall into. You don\u2019t have to spend more money on activities in order for family time to be memorable, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThis goal is very doable with a little creative thought and effort. Think about how a child will sometimes have more fun playing with the box a birthday gift came in than the gift itself,\u201d he said. \u201cDo a search online for resources with lists of fun family activities. You\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to find that there are a lot of options where the cost can be kept really low.\u201d\n\nImages By Tang Ming Tung via Getty Images Fun doesn't have to set you back financially\n\n8. I want to start getting up earlier during the week so I start my day on a less hectic, anxiety-ridden note. Ideally, I\u2019d like to consistently have enough me time in the mornings to do things like exercise, journal or meditate.\n\nHow achievable it is: 2/5\n\nThis one might be hard to pull off because it doesn\u2019t include a game plan for how the person will pull off waking up earlier, Stemen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too broad,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what time they want to get up or when they\u2019ll go to bed. This goal will be more achievable when they set a time and activities they want to do and come up with a realistic plan to achieve it.\u201d\n\n9. I want to find a charity or organization to volunteer with in 2019. I try to contribute financially to different causes where I can, but I would like to be more giving when it comes to my time.\n\nGrade: 4/5\n\nCompared with some other resolutions, this goal is easy to achieve, Maryland-based psychologist Samantha Rodman said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "This State Wanted To Expand Healthcare For The Poor.

Voters rejected the citizen initiative last month, 53 to 47 percent. Three other red states passed similar measures the same day.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nPerhaps the chief takeaway from the rejected citizen initiative to expand Medicaid in Montana last month is this: Be careful when you poke a giant.\n\nMontana was one of four red states with Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and the only one where it failed. And the reason why, many close observers both inside and outside of the state agree, almost certainly came down to a tactical decision to link expansion to an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax.\n\nSupporters thought that strategy would boost their effort with voters, but it attracted Big Tobacco into the fight, along with the $17.2 million it spent, much of it on a television advertising blitz. Opponents raised nearly $19 million to defeat the measure, finance reports filed with the state show.\n\nProponents, with about $9.7 million to spend, simply couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\n\u201cIt was impossible with the money we had to compete,\u201d said one of the leaders of the coalition, who spoke with Stateline but asked not to be named because the coalition has not yet publicly addressed what went wrong. The tobacco interests \u201cgot too far ahead with their messaging.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, this activist said, it may have been a mistake to combine Medicaid expansion and a tax that targeted a deep-pocketed opposition.\n\nThe tobacco industry went nowhere near the other states where Medicaid expanding initiatives appeared on November\u2019s ballot: Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Medicaid expansion plans passed comfortably in those states, but the Montana version fell decisively, 53 to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cThe basic lesson is that if you create a big political target, don\u2019t be surprised if people pay attention to it,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cIf you propose to raise tobacco taxes, don\u2019t be surprised if tobacco pushes all its chips in. The same happens when you try to raise soda taxes.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is a government-supported health insurance for the poor, and each state has an option to expand that program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nAdam Searing, an associate professor at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, noted that the only difference between Montana and the three other states was the inclusion of a specific tax in the Montana initiative. That inclusion diluted the central message of the ballot measure, he added.\n\n\u201cBasically it seems the more you focus on that central issue of expanding affordable health care to more working class people, the more successful you are likely to be,\u201d Searing said of the success in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that advocates in other non-expansion states might want to take to heart as they continue their fight \u2014 which they are vowing to do, despite the ruling earlier this month by a federal judge in Texas that the entire ACA, including the Medicaid expansion provision, is unconstitutional.\n\nMany legal analysts on both the left and the right say the decision by U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in a lawsuit brought by Republican governors and attorneys general from 20 states is unlikely to stand. In any case, the ACA will remain in place while the ruling makes its way through the appellate courts, perhaps ending up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fairness Project, an advocacy group that reportedly spent $6 million in support of the initiatives in November, names Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming as states where Medicaid expansion initiatives could reach the ballot in 2020. Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the project, said the ruling in Texas hasn\u2019t dampened the group\u2019s conviction that most Americans support expansion.\n\nIn a tracking poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation the week after the midterm elections, 59 percent of voters in non-expansion states said they favored expansion.\n\nIn Montana, Medicaid already had been expanded by law in 2016 to include any adult with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line. In 2018, that translates to $16,753 for an individual. Before the expansion, only Montana low-income adults who were caregivers, pregnant or disabled qualified for Medicaid.\n\nBut that 2016 expansion had been set to expire in July 2019. The ballot proposal last month, Initiative 185, would have made the Medicaid expansion permanent. (The other three states will see expansion for the first time.)\n\nNow it will be up to the Republican-controlled legislature to determine the future of the expansion in Montana, a high priority for popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C., have adopted Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nExpansion proponents in the Treasure State think their losing campaign this fall, which entailed a grassroots operation, will pay off with a legislative victory in the winter.\n\nThe pro-expansion campaign, said Jessica Rhoades, Bullock\u2019s health policy adviser, \u201ccreated a volunteer network of very motivated nurses and doctors who can go into the legislative session with a strong base of support behind them.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming Montana House speaker, said court ruling in Texas is worth paying attention to, but it won\u2019t halt work in Montana to craft a Medicaid expansion program that\u2019s financially sustainable. \u201cWe\u2019re still forging ahead,\u201d Hertz said.\n\nThe legislative session begins Jan. 7, and lawmakers already are crafting bills in preparation for upcoming hearings, Hertz said. Republicans are interested in cost-control measures that could include performance audits and work requirements for single, able-bodied adults, he said.\n\nMontana Senate President Scott Sales, also a Republican, agreed that expansion proponents will still have the votes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d spoken to me a few days before the court ruling, I\u2019d say Medicaid expansion is going to pass in some form; I think that\u2019s still the case,\u201d Sales said.\n\nFinancial mismatch\n\nThe $19 million raised in opposition to the campaign, 91 percent of it from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, is more than twice the amount spent on Montana ballot measures since at least 2006, data compiled by FollowTheMoney showed. The nonprofit, which tracks campaign spending, found it was also more than $7 million above the amount spent by all candidates in the last Montana gubernatorial election, in 2016.\n\nSupporters of Initiative 185 raised $9.7 million, also more than previous Montana ballot measures. That coalition \u2014 Healthy Montana for I-185 \u2014 included groups representing hospitals and health care providers in the state as well as advocacy groups representing the poor, retired people and labor unions. It also included state chapters of national organizations that support efforts to end diseases, such as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\n\nProponents say the financial mismatch doomed the initiative even as pre-election polls had shown voters evenly divided on the measure. Montana State University, for example, reported in late October that 41.4 percent of Montana voters were in favor of expansion versus 40.8 percent against, with a 2 point margin of error.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this article, Chuck Denowh, the spokesman for Montanans Against Tax Hikes \u2014 created for the Medicaid campaign \u2014 and president of the Montana Group, a Helena political and public relationship consulting firm, said he was on a family vacation and couldn\u2019t respond. He did not respond to a request to designate someone else with the organization. Altria did not respond by deadline to a request for an interview.\n\nOther factors besides big spending by tobacco may have contributed to the loss.\n\nThe ballot language began with a description of the tax increase, and that didn\u2019t help, said Jesse Cross-Call of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy and research think tank in Washington. \u201cUnless you were intimately aware of it before going into the voting booth, it was hard to know what was at stake. It looked like the initiative was about raising taxes rather than extending health care to more people.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s measure proposed a general sales tax increase and the initiatives in Idaho and Nebraska left it up to the legislature to decide how to pay for the expansion.\n\nBut, according to Rhoades, early polling suggested that linking a tobacco tax to expansion would improve its chances. That doesn\u2019t appear to have been the case.\n\nCoalition members pushed for the tobacco increase not only as a source of financing for the expansion, but also as a discouragement to smoking, which itself, Healthy Montana claimed, costs Montanans $440 million in health care every year.\n\nThe initiative would have increased the tobacco tax by $2 for a pack of 20 cigarettes. It also would have increased taxes on snuff and created a tax on vaping.\n\nFewer uninsured in Montana\n\nBy March of this year, Montana\u2019s Medicaid had extended benefits to 94,000 newly eligible beneficiaries, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. Bullock\u2019s office said expansion, along with other elements of the Affordable Care Act, reduced the uninsured rate in the state from 15 percent in 2015 to 7.4 percent today.\n\nIn its economic analysis, the university report said expansion has injected $350 million to $400 million of new spending into the state each year. That money has generated about 5,000 new jobs and will produce about $270 million in personal income in each year between 2018 and 2020, the report found.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs, with its portion gradually falling to 90 percent by 2020. That\u2019s compared with 65.5 percent for traditional Medicaid.\n\nThe proponents of Initiative 185 said the increased tobacco taxes, which they estimated would\u2019ve raised an additional $74 million a year by 2023, would pay for that extra 10 percent.\n\nThe university report estimated that after 2020, when the federal match drops to 90 percent, the increased state tax revenue from the economic activity generated by the expansion would be enough to cover the state\u2019s expansion costs without raising taxes or creating new ones.\n\nThat is the position Bullock has taken in urging the legislature to pass expansion next year. The governor\u2019s proposal does not call for an increase in tobacco taxes but would include a small increase in taxes on medical providers.\n\nBut that was not the message of the initiative\u2019s opponents, who ran ads claiming \u2014 falsely, proponents say \u2014 that the proposed tobacco increase would not cover expansion costs. All Montanans would end up footing the bill, their ads proclaimed.\n\nThe looming question, of course, is what will happen in the legislature. Some of those who led the campaign for expansion have told Stateline they are pessimistic, fearing legislators who are inclined to vote against can now point to the election results to justify a \u201cno\u201d vote.\n\nCasey Schreiner, the incoming House minority leader and supporter of expansion, said he wasn\u2019t overly worried.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the legislature sees the benefit of taking the sunset off,\u201d the Democrat told Stateline, referring to the July 2019 expiration of the current Medicaid expansion plan. \u201cEverybody understands what happened, that a large amount of money got dumped into Montana and the initiative was mischaracterized as a tax increase rather than expanding health care."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Doctor's Note Policies Punish Students For Being Poor", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-doctors-note-policies-poverty_us_5c1bfc6fe4b05c88b6f66933", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s said that during the holidays, all roads lead home \u2015 or, for those who have access, to the doctor.\n\nThe holiday season is like being invited to a white elephant gift exchange only to find out that each beautifully wrapped box contains a different variation of stomach virus, cold, strep or the flu. Sick students need to stay stay home and miss school. And doctor\u2019s notes verifying a student is sick and unable to attend class have become as elusive and rare as one of Willy Wonka\u2019s infamous golden tickets for millions of children in America.\n\nIn a country like the U.S. (in which adequate health care is far from an easily accessible human right), it\u2019s ridiculous that students are still required to provide a note from a medical practitioner to receive an excused absence. Such policies disproportionality affect economically disadvantaged youth and youth of color and serve as yet another reminder that our educational and medical systems are designed to set certain students up for failure.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are often synonymous in America \u2015 1 in 3 black, Native American and Hispanic children live in poverty, compared to 1 in 10 white children. Children who live in poverty are more likely to go uninsured than children who don\u2019t, and the total number of uninsured young people in America is on the rise.\n\nFor the 3.9 million children living without health care coverage, the very ability to go to the doctor when they\u2019re sick and to get \u201cpermission\u201d to miss school is little more than a dream. And while many uninsured children qualify for some type of government coverage, their ability to obtain that coverage is often out of their hands. Parents who lack coverage for themselves (for any variety of reasons) are often unfamiliar with the inner workings of America\u2019s health care system and therefore don\u2019t know how to seek government assistance for their kids.\n\nThe necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents.\n\nMedicaid is often depicted as the be-all, end-all answer for those who can\u2019t afford health care, but Medicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI was raised by a single mother who worked multiple jobs, and as a young child, I received Medicaid coverage. As my family transitioned into different income brackets, I lost that coverage and went without health insurance entirely when my mother made enough money to keep food on the table and gas in the car but made too much to qualify for government assistance. Once we could afford our own private health insurance coverage, we were still often unable to afford the copays and out-of-pocket expenses necessary to utilize the medical system. Our story is just one of many like it.\n\nEven students who do have adequate health care coverage (and can therefore obtain one of those elusive doctor\u2019s notes to excuse their school absences) are ultimately reliant on other factors outside of their control when they need to see a physician. Many times, a simple cold, stomachache or other illness can be cured with home remedy and rest. The necessity of a doctor\u2019s note, even for children with insurance, can place undue financial stress on parents whose work situation doesn\u2019t give them the flexibility to accompany their kid to the doctor.\n\nIf a parent\u2019s schedule does allow for a trip to the physician, the high cost of copays, deductibles and prescriptions mean many Americans must scrape together what should\u2019ve been that week\u2019s grocery, gas or electric bill money just to provide their child\u2019s school with a slip of paper. And this doesn\u2019t even take into account the inherent assumption that all parents have access to private or public transportation, a luxury many often take for granted. For 45 percent of the American population, public transit is nonexistent where they live.\n\nMedicaid coverage often perpetuates a cycle that keeps families who strive to rise above the poverty line in fear of losing affordable health care if they do.\n\nI know from experience that for families in situations like these \u2015 who lack adequate health care or who are barely able to afford the coverage they do have \u2015 a certain set of criteria must be met before going to see the doctor for one of those notes. How bad does it hurt? Is it broken? Is your temperature \u201ctoo high\u201d? Depending on the answers, we either stayed home or went to school anyway.\n\nThis is the kind of criteria we\u2019ve forced upon economically disadvantaged youth. Kids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nYou might be wondering: Does it really matter if a child has unexcused absences? What\u2019s the big deal? Schools often create their own policies as to what qualifies as an excused or unexcused absence. If an administration decides a missed class for health reasons without a note from a physician is \u201cunexcused,\u201d it can impact students\u2019 grades; many teachers take these absences into consideration when calculating a student\u2019s overall letter grade. And in many districts across America, if a student has unexcused absences, they lose the ability to participate in extracurricular activities and sports as punishment.\n\nIn more extreme cases, students with multiple unexcused absences over an extended period of time are considered truant. This can leave parents facing hundreds of dollars\u2019 worth of truancy fines and even time behind bars. Penalties like these have a far greater negative impact on youth who already come from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nKids learn at a young age that health care, and the ability to take full advantage of what the system has to offer, is a rich man\u2019s game.\n\nWe have a misconception here in America that children have access to health care via their school nurse, and that the nurse can excuse a child\u2019s absence based on their own diagnosis. While this does happen, not all students have access to this kind of care; only about 82 percent of public elementary and secondary schools have full- or part-time nurses on staff (the number is even lower for private institutions). Students who can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s note and who don\u2019t have access to a school nurse find themselves in a lose-lose situation when it comes to their attendance record.\n\nDoctor\u2019s note policies have no place in our K-12 schools. We shouldn\u2019t punish America\u2019s children for being denied their basic human right to health care (or for having parents without the financial means to take advantage of the health care they do possess).\n\nWhat we need are policies that are empathetic toward our country\u2019s economically disadvantaged youth. If a parent says their child\u2019s absence is health-related, that absence should be considered excused \u2015 case closed. And because these policies are determined by local educational agencies, changes will only come via discussion at a local level \u2015 school boards, parent-teacher associations, town hall meetings and other public forums.\n\nEconomically disadvantaged youth and youth of color are already perpetually discriminated against in America\u2019s schools. The least our educational system can do is remove one stressor from the equation.\n\nUntil then, doctor\u2019s notes will continue to provide opportunity and access only to those who can afford it."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Health Care In Texas Is A Nightmare For Women Restaurant Workers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-restaurant-workers-sexual-health-care_us_5c1a7690e4b0446830f95b5c", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Emily Jaschke Texas is one of the worst states for reproductive health. Chef and restaurant owner Erin Smith founded a group that aims to help women access affordable reproductive care.\n\nBeing a woman in the restaurant industry has its challenges \u2015 from sexual harassment, to unfair compensation to inadequate access to health insurance. Being a woman in the restaurant industry in Texas presents a whole additional set of obstacles.\n\nJust 14 percent of restaurant employees across the country receive health insurance benefits from their employers, meaning many rely on publicly funded resources for health care. But that\u2019s not so simple in Texas: These types of health centers in the state meet only 10 percent of the need, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nTexas is also one of the worst states for reproductive health. In 2011, for example, the state cut its family planning budget by two-thirds, which led to an increase in teen abortions and births. That same year, it also rejected federal funding for a Medicaid women\u2019s health program, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nWomen\u2019s health care became a huge concern for Erin Smith, owner of Feges BBQ in Houston. Her outrage grew when Donald Trump became president. \u201cAt each step in the political process over the past two years, everything\u2019s so uncertain, and we need to take a stand and let people know the threat women are facing in health care, especially in Texas,\u201d Smith told HuffPost.\n\nIn 2017, the chef helped form I\u2019ll Have What She\u2019s Having, an organization fronted by chefs, bartenders and servers that\u2019s raising money and awareness to combat the assault on women\u2019s health care in Texas. The group\u2019s footprint is small, but it offers resources to women in an area where the need is great.\n\nIHWSH has helped its nearly 200 members, all of whom are women in the restaurant industry, access free gynecological exams. \u201c[Exams] are typically not covered under insurance,\u201d Smith said, adding, \u201ca lot of the women are not provided insurance through employment, and most don\u2019t have insurance on their own.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the group raised and donated more than $210,000 to local organizations that prioritize women\u2019s health, including Planned Parenthood and The Rose, which provides breast cancer detection and treatment services to reduce deaths by the disease.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we become sexually active, we have very few healthcare paths as women. We are either actively preventing pregnancy, not actively preventing pregnancy, actively trying to conceive, or pregnant,\u201d Smith wrote in an essay for Food and Wine. \u201cBecause of this reality, more women are driven away from fields that do not provide easier and more affordable access to healthcare and other valuable resources.\u201d\n\nSmith gained a new level of understanding for her cause in 2018, when she learned she was pregnant. She\u2019s fortunate to be the owner of her restaurant, she said, because it allowed her to come up with a viable maternity leave plan for herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very healthy pregnancy, but that\u2019s not the norm for everybody,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf there\u2019d been something that went wrong where the doctor put me on bedrest, I really don\u2019t know what we would have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my eighth month,\u201d she told HuffPost in December. \u201cI\u2019m going to the doctor all the time now. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s something a lot of restaurants are able and willing to accommodate. The restaurant industry in general is made up of mom-and-pop small businesses. You can\u2019t put all the onus on the employer \u2014 there needs to be some help from the government so small businesses can accommodate.\u201d\n\nFeges BBQ does not provide its employees with an insurance policy, but Smith said that if one of her employees becomes pregnant, she would do everything she could to be supportive, including offering paid leave.\n\n\u201cWe would try to work something out to offer some paid time off but would need to guarantee they\u2019d come back,\u201d she said, adding that she would offer both maternity and paternity leave. \u201cIf any of the guys in our business have a baby, we would want to give them some time off, too, because they\u2019re a critical part of the parenting process.\u201d\n\nStill, Smith said that the lack of women\u2019s resources puts them at a severe disadvantage, including in their ability to climb the corporate ladder. Without a proper system in which women can be both parents and professionals, this won\u2019t change, she said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see women in leadership positions in this business or other industries \u2014 unless women make the decision not to have families.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "On Christmas, Trump Again Lobbies for Border Wall", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/us/politics/trump-border-wall-shutdown.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-25 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "The president, who canceled his 16-day vacation to his Florida estate and instead remained in Washington, continued to offer contradicting assertions about the fate of his signature campaign promise.\n\n\u201cI can tell you it\u2019s not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they\u2019d like to call it,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, a nod to the \u201cartistic slats\u201d he has started advocating instead of the concrete wall he once promised. \u201cI\u2019ll call it whatever they want.

In the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s surveys, an index above 50 indicates the economy is in expansion; its most recent reading was 62.1 for the manufacturing sector and 60.7 for services.\n\nThe most concrete warning signal is coming from financial markets. But the bond market is generally more closely tethered to economic ups and downs than the stock market, and while it is suggesting slower growth ahead, it is not at recessionary levels.\n\nFor example, the two-year Treasury bond yielded 2.56 percent at Monday\u2019s close. That\u2019s still higher than the roughly 2.4 percent where the Fed\u2019s benchmark overnight rate now sits. You would expect that if a recession were imminent, the two-year yield would fall lower, reflecting expectations of Fed rate cuts to combat the downturn.\n\nAt this point in December 2007, which we now know was the beginning of the Great Recession, the Fed\u2019s target interest rate was 4.25 percent. But the bond market was already pricing in more cuts in the years ahead, with the two-year yield ending the year at 3.12 percent.\n\nMost economic and financial indicators are not pointing toward some economic collapse in 2019, but rather to a return to the kind of moderate economic growth that was completely normal from 2010 to 2017.\n\nIn this story, 2018 has been the aberration \u2014 fueled by a commodity boom and the temporary effects of tax cuts.
