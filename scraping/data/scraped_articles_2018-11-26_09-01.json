Border crossings were closed in both directions for several hours, and it did not appear that any migrants breached the frontier.\n\nSunday's events will further electrify political tensions in Washington as it gets to work after the Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of a month of transition and increasing vulnerability for the President.\n\nTrump and Congress are already facing a two-week deadline to fund the government or risk a partial federal shutdown. Trump's White House is on edge as he mulls the fate of key players ahead of a staff reshuffle. The President is also keen to make the most of his final month of a GOP monopoly on power in Capitol Hill, and finally win funding for his border wall. He is also pushing an apparently reluctant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to act on a criminal justice bill -- one of the few bipartisan initiatives this year.\n\nTrump is also set to travel to another big international summit this week -- the G20 in Argentina -- that carries the habitual possibility that he could again fall out with other world leaders. The trip will also bring him face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the most contentious moment in US-China relations for decades as a trade war rages between the two powers.\n\nDemocrats lining up investigations\n\nMost ominously for Trump, Democrats are positioning themselves to unleash an unprecedented regime of investigation and oversight against his White House as soon as they take the reins of power in January, while special counsel Robert Mueller grinds away ever closer to the President's inner circle\n\nJust how miserable things could get next year for the President were revealed by incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. The California Democrat vowed to bring acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress to probe whether he was appointed with the express purpose of disrupting the Mueller investigation.\n\nHe said the President was not being honest in casting doubt on the CIA's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSchiff also said the new Democratic House would investigate whether the President's response to this and other foreign policy questions was being influenced by a \"hidden hand\" of investments or past or business ties.\n\n\"Is his personal financial interest driving US policy in the Gulf? Is it driving US policy vis-a-vis the Russians? We don't know, but it would be irresponsible not to find out,\" Schiff said.\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who will head the House Oversight Committee, vowed proportionate investigations.\n\n\"The American people said to us through this election, 'We want accountability. We want to check on this President of the United States.' But they also said something else. They said, We want you to solve our problems.'\" Cummings said.\n\nA glimpse of how Washington will change\n\nThe prospects of flying subpoenas and administration officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill points to crucial dynamics ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nHow will the President react? Will Democrats overreach and play into McConnell's warnings of \"presidential harassment?\" Can the President leverage Democratic opposition to court suburban voters who deserted him in the midterms? Or will any revelations either from congressional probes or Mueller prove to be so serious that they bury his White House in scandal and put his entire presidency at risk?\n\nTrump could emerge from a period of retooling in his administration facing even fewer restraints from subordinates than has already been the case.\n\nKey officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly are waiting to see if they will be retained. And Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he's getting irked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over recent stock market losses.\n\nMnuchin is not currently thought to be threatened, but the report, and the President's frequent tweeting about oil prices and the markets, does appear to hint at some nervousness over the future of the economy, which in its currently roaring state is the best argument for his 2020 reelection hopes.\n\nIn a glimpse into the feudal nature of life in Trump's orbit, his former political aide Corey Lewandowski writes in his new book that enemies of the President are \"embedded\" in the White House and government agencies and trying to thwart his agenda, according to The Washington Post.\n\nTrump has often embraced moments of converging threats and challenges to stoke an atmosphere of chaos in Washington that bolsters his standing with his political base and puts his opponents off balance.\n\nBut he now faces a test of his political strategy since his method -- for instance, using inflammatory rhetoric about immigration -- appears to have hurt Republicans in House races, even if it boosted Senate contenders.\n\nFor now, there is no sign of an adjustment: Trump broke convention in his Thanksgiving calls with troops by injecting political rhetoric about immigration and trade and boasting about his success.\n\nHis recent behavior, including a feud with Chief Justice John Roberts, either betrays an inability to rein in his relish for confrontation or a strategic decision that the wrecking ball approach is the best way to ensure his reelection.\n\nBack on the border\n\nTrump spent part of the weekend highlighting the migrant caravan.\n\n\"If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!\" Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nHe may return to the topic on Monday in a pair of rallies for Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is facing a runoff amid controversy over her past racially-tinged comments and actions.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the incoming administration in Mexico has agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain south of the US border while their applications were processed, in what would be seen by Trump as a victory.\n\nThe new government however denied in a statement to CNN that a deal had been done.\n\nThe politics of immigration will bear watching in the weeks ahead since they are crucial to Trump, who tends to resort to extremes and Democrats who do not wish to come across as soft on border issues.\n\nOne Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst, who faces a potentially tricky Iowa re-election race in 2020, hinted at the delicate nature of an issue that electrifies Trump base but can alienate more moderate voters on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nShe said she would prefer that Trump not follow through on his threat to close the US border, though pointed to the reports from Mexico to argue his rhetoric could be working.\n\n\"I certainly think the President sees results any time that he does bring up an issue, and he does lay down certain reasons why he's doing what he's doing,\" Ernst told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nErnst also said she hoped that Trump would not honor threats to partially shutter the government if he does not get his border wall funded.\n\nTrump said last week that if there was ever going to be a shutdown over the border wall, now would probably be the time to do it.\n\nCongress averted a shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government. The package did not, however, include money for Trump's wall. Instead, lawmakers passed a shorter-term spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies, until December 7.\n\nIt's not clear either side really wants a shutdown. If precedent is any guide, it's also possible the funding crunch could be put off by short-term deals that run until the end of the year or beyond.\n\nThe calculations could also influence other priorities in the mix, including disaster funding requests for fire-ravaged California, and a drive by Democrats and some Republicans to shield Mueller.\n\nBipartisan anger over Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia could also complicate deal making, with both sides conscious of how actions now could play out in the new political reality next year."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Mexico says it will deport migrants who rushed border", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/H9dySBvoNBQ/mexico-migrants-us-border-watt-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Mexico's government says it will deport 500 migrants who tried to rush the US border at the San Ysidro port of entry.

Video of the scene showed a cloud of tear gas that sent people running and screaming, including families with young children.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection said the migrants threw projectiles that struck several agents.\n\n\"Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents' safety,\" the agency said on Twitter.\n\nMigrants on the Mexico side of the border take cover from tear gas fired by US agents.\n\nThe incident marked an escalation of tensions that have been mounting since groups of Central American migrants began arriving in Tijuana a few weeks ago on their journey to attempt to gain entry to the United States.\n\nThe migrants' presence has drawn demonstrators -- for and against them -- and threats from President Donald Trump to close the US-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Tijuana's mayor has called on the Mexican government and the international community for help.\n\nThe melee closed one of the world's busiest international crossings, San Ysidro Port of Entry, to vehicle and pedestrian traffic for several hours. By Sunday afternoon, CBP reopened crossing lanes in both directions to pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nMigrants run along the Tijuana River near the US-Mexico border after US agents threw tear gas to disperse them.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry said federal and local authorities stopped the migrants Sunday from crossing the border illegally. Those identified as having tried to illegally cross will be processed for deportation to their home countries, the ministry said.\n\nBy Sunday night, Tijuana police had arrested 39 people, the agency said on Facebook.\n\nThe Interior Ministry described Sunday's incident as \"acts of provocation\" and warned that far from helping the migrants' cause, it could result in a serious incident on the border.\n\nHow the incident began\n\nThe incident began with a march to the border that organizers said would be peaceful. In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro on Sunday in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.\n\nIn Mexico, the march started at the Benito Ju\u00e1rez Sports Complex -- where most of the migrants are staying -- and continued to the border.\n\nMigrants clash with law enforcement near the US-Mexico border in Tijuana.\n\nAs they reached the border area, some protesters split off toward multiple locations, CBP said. Some attempted to enter through San Ysidro and were turned away, the agency said. Others tried to enter \"directly east and west of the border crossing.\"\n\nAfter they were prevented from entering the port of entry, some of the migrants \"attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.\n\n\"DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our front-line operators, or violates our nation's sovereignty,\" Nielsen said.\n\nThe mayor of Tijuana said on Sunday that he would not let the migrants' actions damage the city's relationship with its neighbors across the border. Residents of Tijuana work, study and visit the United States each day, and the border closures affect them, too, Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum Buenrostro said on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nThe mayor previously said he will not commit city resources to the migrants, including money or public services. He called on the Mexican government -- specifically, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his secretary of domestic affairs -- to provide assistance.\n\n\"The people of Tijuana will not pay for the stay of these migrants. I will not send Tijuana into debt, just like I have been able to avoid the last two years,\" he said in a November 22 Facebook post.\n\n\"We are dealing with a humanitarian crisis and the federal government must step up to its responsibility!!!\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Photos: Unrest at the US-Mexico border", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/4Dd72ReMKtU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images Central American migrants climb a metal barrier on the Mexico-US border near El Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, on Sunday.

Is it the plight of Central American migrants who are seeking asylum in the United States? Or an \"invasion\" at the southern border with Mexico? As always, it depends on the news sources you choose.\n\nSince mid-October Fox News and President Trump's focus on the \"caravan\" has risen and fallen almost in tandem. Fox has labeled the situation a \"crisis\" and Trump has vowed not to let the migrants cross the border.\n\nThe TV coverage subsided right after the midterm elections, but picked up again by mid-November. And for the better part of a week, Fox's pro-Trump talk shows have been on high alert for the impending arrival of the migrants. The network's banners have been practically screaming about it. A graphic onSaturday night called it \"BATTLE FOR THE SOUTHERN BORDER.\"\n\nNick Watt was As is so often the case, these situations call for more reporting, less shouting. Case in point, CNN'swas live from the San Ysidro Port of Entry on Sunday evening as officials from both the US and Mexico worked to disperse a group of migrants. The use of tear gas was top of mind -- as illustrated in an instantly iconic Reuters photo.\n\nHopefully someone will be able to interview the woman in the photo , and hopefully the \"BATTLE\" hype will be replaced by robust reporting in the days to come.\n\nTrump was watching CBS...\n\nThis was a case of superb timing by \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nScott Pelley had a story Correspondenthad a story on Sunday's program about family separations at the border. The president was evidently watching, because he tweeted soon afterward, calling it a \"phony story\" and labeling the newsmagazine \"fake.\" Why? Because \"we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration.\"\n\nBut numerous reporters said Trump was full of it. Some said he \"lied,\" others said the tweet was \"false.\"\n\nThe Houston Chronicle's Lomi Kriel, who was covering the breakups earlier than anybody, tweeted that Trump \"had a blanket policy to separate parents & kids at the border, incl. kids as young as 18 months and some who were still breastfeeding.\"\n\nAnd NBC's Jacob Soboroff, who was inside the camps, tweeted that Trump \"is the only president to *ever* systematically separate migrant children from their parents as a stated deterrent policy.\"\n\nEither Trump doesn't understand his own policy, or he's misleading his followers on purpose.\n\nA \"channel\" for Trump's fear-mongering?\n\nNick Kristof Over the weekend, New York Times columnist wrote about how newsrooms allowed themselves \"to be manipulated by President Trump to heighten fears about the immigrant caravan.\"\n\nObviously, he wrote, \"there were many journalists who pushed back on the president's narrative, but on the whole I'm afraid news organizations became a channel for carefully calculated fear-mongering about refugees.\"\n\nI think that's a commonly held concern. But there's also a counterargument, expressed by Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty. She said newsrooms used the \"caravan\" to \"dig deeper into the forces that put people on this treacherous path of migration.\"\n\nTumulty was one of my guests on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources.\" With the expectation of a new \"caravan\" news cycle, I started Sunday's show by talking about the two Americas living side by side -- in different news worlds -- one that's been hearing about dangerous immigrants, the other that's been hearing about the danger of manmade climate change. There's hardly any overlap between the two...\n\nPro-Trump talk shows ignored climate change report\n\nHundreds of scientists helped produce the climate assessment that came out on Friday afternoon. The government report countered Trump's climate claims... And it was mostly just ignored by pro-Trump shows and commentators. In my humble opinion, that's a form of climate change denialism.\n\nBut outside the pro-Trump bubble, there was widespread coverage of the dire new report. The warnings were played up high on news websites and nightly newscasts. There were followups on Saturday and Sunday. I was left wondering: Did this attempt at a \"news dump\" backfire?\n\nSorta, kinda. \"It didn't get totally buried,\" Daily Beast editor in chief Noah Shachtman told me . \"But I think it did kind of work.

The waitstaff apologized and instead the group decided to go to the Heritage Suite on the hotel's second floor, while they waited for a table.\n\nUnbeknown to Raichand, the small inconvenience would be the difference between life and death.\n\nNot far from the hotel, 10 men associated with the Islamist terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba quietly docked at the city's waterfront, close to the Gateway of India monument.\n\nThey hijacked several cars, including a police van, and split into at least three groups. At around 11 p.m., one of those groups entered the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.\n\n\"Destiny played a role that evening,\" recalled Raichand. \"Within 15 minutes, we heard loud sounds and started getting calls from reception to tell us that an incident was taking place. When we turned the TV on, we realized we were in the middle of a major terrorist attack.\"\n\nThe attack would become part of what remains one of the most violent and deadly terrorist attacks to have occurred on Indian soil.

For safety, they wanted us to stay in the restaurant,\" Nicholls, the Founding Director of security firm NSA Global and a former consultant to the South African Police Service's VIP Protection Unit, told CNN.\n\nAs Nicholls began to get a better understanding of what was unfolding, he decided to act.\n\nBob Nicholls\n\n\"It appeared that the terrorists were making their way up the hotel. I saw that the side of the restaurant was all glass. I called my team together and said, 'Listen, if these bad guys come up here, we're in a really bad position.' I took control and asked the guys to get an idea of what's around us, to make some educated plans.\"\n\nArmed with knives, meat cleavers and walkie-talkies from the kitchen staff, Nicholls and his team located a conference room that they could secure.\n\n\"We went through the kitchen and into this conference room. What we hadn't realized was there were around a 150 people there as there had been a conference,\" Nicholls said.\n\n\"We barricaded the doors, the elevator on our floor so no one could get up. I had my guys stationed outside, we were feeling confident. The last thing these guys would expect was a bunch of mad South Africans with meat cleavers.\"\n\nIt's estimated that around 450 people were staying at hotel at the time of the attack -- a third of which were now with Nicholls.\n\nIndian and foreign guests rush out of the Taj Mahal hotel, as news of the attack breaks out.\n\n\"All of us were in a different state of mind\"\n\nThat conference room was the Rendezvous Banquet Hall, where businessman Dilip Mehta, 65, was attending a dinner.\n\nMehta remembers the night vividly.\n\n\"At about 9.45 p.m., we went to take the elevator down, but hotel security stopped us saying there was a gang war on the ground floor. We were all quite anxious about what was going on but soon found out through the TV that it was a terror attack,\" Mehta, Managing Director of Pegasus Shipping, told CNN.\n\n\"A few people were calm, some had fainted or were in a state of shock under the tables.

These are the moments when you really reiterate your faith in God, but none of us were panicking.\"\n\n\"I was thinking about who was going to take care of my child because his entire family is here. Death is inevitable but it would have been too unfortunate for my little baby to be left alone without his family,\" said Raichand, who had left her one-year-old son at home with his nanny.\n\nThe Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which dates to the early 1900s, suffered extensive fire damage during the attack.\n\n\"We have a fighting chance against terrorists but fire is a different ballgame\"\n\nAs the situation intensified at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, plans were underway to make an escape.\n\nAfter a loud blast, Nicholls saw fire and smoke billowing from another section of the building.\n\n\"My concern was whether they had plans to blow the whole building up. If the fire came to our part of the building, we wouldn't be able to get out. We have a fighting chance against terrorists but fire is a whole different ballgame,\" said Nicholls.\n\nWith 150 people under his watch, any attempt to leave the hotel was going to be a challenge.\n\n\"I told everyone that we were going to go down the stairs very quietly. But with 150-odd people on a staircase, we were like sitting ducks. Two of my guys went ahead to make sure it was safe, we had two guys at the back. We'd move down to one floor, check the floor and then get everyone down. We did the same on the next floor. It took quite a while to get everyone down. We got out at around 3 or 4 in the morning,\" said Nicholls.\n\n\"We were asked to take off our shoes to avoid making noise because we never knew if there were still terrorists around who could hear us. No one spoke either,\" Mehta recounted.\n\nA few hours later at 7.30 a.m., Raichand and her family were climbing down ladders put up by firefighters.\n\nThe city remained under siege for the next three days.\n\n\"None of us slept. We were glued to the news. Chabad House was right next to our home. We could still see the fire from the Taj. We were witnessing everything,\" said Raichand.\n\nEmployees and guests of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel are recued by firefighters as fire engulfs the building's top floors.\n\n\"I go to the Taj every year for my birthday\"\n\nFor many of the survivors, the weeks and months that followed proved to be tough.\n\n\"I was traumatized for almost six months. I used to get up at night at 3 a.m., and just hold onto my bed. I'd get nightmares and hallucinations. I wasn't myself,\" said Mehta.\n\nGiven the nature of his occupation, Nicholls took a more pragmatic approach and arranged for counseling sessions as soon as he and his team returned home to Johannesburg.\n\nDilip Mehta\n\n\"At the time, we literally switched into work mode. There were moments of uncertainty because we realized we've got this room full of people that we're making decisions for,\" Nicholls reflected.\n\n\"It's what we do for a living. It wasn't a decision that we made. It was almost an instinct.\"\n\nBut time is a great healer, Mehta says, and the events from a decade ago have offered him a fresh perspective on life, he tells CNN.\n\n\"My objective now is to give back. There's a purpose for me to be here. My life took a 360 degree turn,\" he said.\n\nRaichand too decided to face her fears.\n\n\"For the next four, five years I couldn't celebrate my birthday. But now, I've taken it in my stride and I go to the Taj every year for my birthday.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "More than 140 whales dead after mass stranding in New Zealand", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/P3jIvXpE5Ro/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As many as 145 whales have died after being found stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand, conservation officials said Monday.\n\nTwo pods of pilot whales were discovered just over a mile apart on Mason Bay, Stewart Island, a sparsely populated island in the country's south.\n\nAuthorities were first alerted to the mass stranding by a hiker Saturday evening.

The bodies were recovered then,\" he said.\n\nThe Sentinelese: World's most isolated tribe\n\nThe Sentinelese have lived in complete isolation on the remote North Sentinel Island for tens of thousands of years. The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan.\n\nIndia has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders alive.\n\nPeople are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night.\n\nAnd while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations.\n\nThe island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports.\n\nAt least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011.\n\nHe returned to his boat twice before vanishing\n\nTraveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese.\n\nIndian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26.\n\nHe had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nJohn Allen Chau, right, was in Cape Town days before he traveled to North Sentinel Island.\n\nHe asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him.\n\nHe carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories.\n\nAfter he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15.\n\nThey stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said.\n\nHe returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said.\n\nBut that did not discourage him.\n\nHe returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat.\n\nOn the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back.\n\nThe fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed.\n\nAll seven locals who facilitated the trip have been arrested.\n\nHis diary reveals his last days\n\nIn excerpts from his journal, Chau described his time on the island and the challenges he faced. A tribesman shot at him with a bow and arrow, piercing a Bible he was carrying, he wrote in his diary, pages of which were shared by his mother with the Washington Post.\n\n\"I hollered, 'My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,'\" he wrote. Shortly after, a young member of the tribe shot at him, according to his account.\n\nIn pages left with the fishermen who facilitated his trip to the island, his musings are a clear indication of his desire to convert the tribe.\n\n\"Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?\" he wrote.\n\nHis notes indicate that he knew the trip was illegal, describing how the small fishing vessel transported him to the isolated island under cover of darkness, evading patrols.\n\nPlease do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed John Chau in a letter to his family\n\n\"God Himself was hiding us from the Coast Guard and many patrols,\" he wrote.\n\nBefore he left the boat for the last time, Chau wrote one final note to his family and gave it to the fishermen.\n\n\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people,\" it said. \"God, I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed -- rather please live your lives in obedience to whatever He has called you to and I will see you again when you pass through the veil.\"\n\nHe loved Jesus\n\nRaised in Vancouver, Washington, Chau was first drawn to the outdoors after discovering a rcopy of \"Robinson Crusoe\" while in elementary school, he said in an article several years ago in The Outbound Collective, a website and app that helps people discover the outdoors.\n\nHe and his brother would paint their faces with wild blackberry juice and run around their backyard with bows and spears made from sticks, according to the article.\n\nChau graduated from Oral Roberts University, where he got involved with Covenant Journey, the Christian ministry that takes college students on immersion trips to Israel, according to Staver, who is the group's chairman.\n\nChau traveled to Israel with Covenant Journey, and to South Africa on missions with a group at Oral Roberts, Staver said.\n\n\"John loved people, and he loved Jesus. He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\" Staver said in a press release. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nIn the Outward Collective article, Chau spoke of his earlier adventures, including hiking Table Mountain in Washington state on Christmas break while in college.\n\nChau said going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was on the top of his adventure to-do list, the article said.\n\nHe's not the first one killed on the island\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which is illegal for outsiders to land on.\n\nIn 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding North Sentinel Island after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International.\n\nAn image of a Sentinelese tribesman aiming a bow and arrow at a helicopter in 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nIn the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nFirst contact was made by the British in the late 1800s, when, despite their attempts to hide, six individuals from the tribe were captured and taken to the main island of the Andaman Island archipelago. Two captured adults died of illness while the four children were returned -- perhaps also infected with illnesses that the islanders' immune systems were unequipped to deal with.\n\nAnthropological expeditions were made to tribal groups in the island chain in the 1980s and 1990s, and \"gift-dropping trips\" continued until the mid-90s, but now all contact has ceased.\n\nThe Indian government has adopted an \"'eyes-on and hands-off' policy to ensure that no poachers enter (North Sentinel Island),\" according to India's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nTribe encounters are usually violent\n\nThe Andaman Island tribe is one of the last remaining isolated groups in the world.\n\nJonathan Mazower of Survival International, which campaigns for the protection of isolated tribes, says there are around 100 such tribes around the world. Most are found in the Amazon rainforest but there are many in New Guinea as well as in forests and islands elsewhere.\n\nWhen contact does occur, it can prove fatal -- tribespeople frequently attack intruders, and can also fall victim to common diseases like the flu, for which they have no immunity. \"Often, they are very fearful of outsiders -- with very good reason,\" Mazower said.\n\n\"Sometimes they will have in their collective memory a massacre, a violent incident, or a disease or epidemic -- so very often, there are well-founded reasons for these tribes to not want to have anything to do\" with the outside world, Mazower told CNN.\n\nWhile the Sentinelese are protected by Indian laws which make it illegal to intrude on their island, most uncontacted people do not have the same fortune, their habitats instead being encroached upon by unwelcome outsiders.\n\n\"The most important challenge, by far, is to protect their land,\" Mazower said. \"That is the absolute essential. If their lands are protected, which is their right under international law, then there is actually no reason they should not continue to survive and thrive."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "US closes major San Diego port of entry as migrants rush border", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/Ex0wH-5WDlY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) A major US-Mexico border crossing in San Diego was closed for hours on Sunday after a group of migrants on the Mexican side rushed the border area, leading US Border Patrol agents to fire tear gas at the group.\n\nAbout 500 migrants on the Mexican side of the border overwhelmed police blockades near the San Ysidro Port of Entry Sunday afternoon, two journalists at the scene in Tijuana told CNN.\n\nA migrant family runs from tear gas released by US border patrol agents near the fence between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego.\n\nAs the migrants tried to cross the border, authorities on the US side used tear gas to disperse them, the journalists said.

Meanwhile, Tijuana's mayor has called on the Mexican government and the international community for help.\n\nThe melee closed one of the world's busiest international crossings, San Ysidro Port of Entry, to vehicle and pedestrian traffic for several hours.

In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro on Sunday in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.\n\nIn Mexico, the march started at the Benito Ju\u00e1rez Sports Complex -- where most of the migrants are staying -- and continued to the border.\n\nMigrants clash with law enforcement near the US-Mexico border in Tijuana.\n\nAs they reached the border area, some protesters split off toward multiple locations, CBP said. Some attempted to enter through San Ysidro and were turned away, the agency said. Others tried to enter \"directly east and west of the border crossing.\"\n\nAfter they were prevented from entering the port of entry, some of the migrants \"attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.\n\n\"DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our front-line operators, or violates our nation's sovereignty,\" Nielsen said.\n\nThe mayor of Tijuana said on Sunday that he would not let the migrants' actions damage the city's relationship with its neighbors across the border. Residents of Tijuana work, study and visit the United States each day, and the border closures affect them, too, Juan Manuel Gast\u00e9lum Buenrostro said on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nThe mayor previously said he will not commit city resources to the migrants, including money or public services. He called on the Mexican government -- specifically, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his secretary of domestic affairs -- to provide assistance.\n\n\"The people of Tijuana will not pay for the stay of these migrants.

The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan.\n\nIndia has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders alive.\n\nPeople are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night.\n\nAnd while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations.\n\nThe island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports.\n\nAt least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011.\n\nHe returned to his boat twice before vanishing\n\nTraveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese.\n\nIndian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26.\n\nHe had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nJohn Allen Chau, right, was in Cape Town days before he traveled to North Sentinel Island.\n\nHe asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him.\n\nHe carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories.\n\nAfter he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15.\n\nThey stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said.\n\nHe returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said.\n\nBut that did not discourage him.\n\nHe returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat.\n\nOn the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back.\n\nThe fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed.\n\nAll seven locals who facilitated the trip have been arrested.\n\nHis diary reveals his last days\n\nIn excerpts from his journal, Chau described his time on the island and the challenges he faced. A tribesman shot at him with a bow and arrow, piercing a Bible he was carrying, he wrote in his diary, pages of which were shared by his mother with the Washington Post.\n\n\"I hollered, 'My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,'\" he wrote. Shortly after, a young member of the tribe shot at him, according to his account.\n\nIn pages left with the fishermen who facilitated his trip to the island, his musings are a clear indication of his desire to convert the tribe.\n\n\"Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?\" he wrote.\n\nHis notes indicate that he knew the trip was illegal, describing how the small fishing vessel transported him to the isolated island under cover of darkness, evading patrols.\n\nPlease do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed John Chau in a letter to his family\n\n\"God Himself was hiding us from the Coast Guard and many patrols,\" he wrote.\n\nBefore he left the boat for the last time, Chau wrote one final note to his family and gave it to the fishermen.\n\n\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people,\" it said. \"God, I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed -- rather please live your lives in obedience to whatever He has called you to and I will see you again when you pass through the veil.\"\n\nHe loved Jesus\n\nRaised in Vancouver, Washington, Chau was first drawn to the outdoors after discovering a rcopy of \"Robinson Crusoe\" while in elementary school, he said in an article several years ago in The Outbound Collective, a website and app that helps people discover the outdoors.\n\nHe and his brother would paint their faces with wild blackberry juice and run around their backyard with bows and spears made from sticks, according to the article.\n\nChau graduated from Oral Roberts University, where he got involved with Covenant Journey, the Christian ministry that takes college students on immersion trips to Israel, according to Staver, who is the group's chairman.\n\nChau traveled to Israel with Covenant Journey, and to South Africa on missions with a group at Oral Roberts, Staver said.\n\n\"John loved people, and he loved Jesus. He was willing to give his life to share Jesus with the people on North Sentinel island,\" Staver said in a press release. \"Ever since high school, John wanted to go to North Sentinel to share Jesus with this indigenous people.\"\n\nIn the Outward Collective article, Chau spoke of his earlier adventures, including hiking Table Mountain in Washington state on Christmas break while in college.\n\nChau said going back to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was on the top of his adventure to-do list, the article said.\n\nHe's not the first one killed on the island\n\nChau is not the first person to fall victim to the Sentinelese after intruding on their island, which is illegal for outsiders to land on.\n\nIn 2006, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding North Sentinel Island after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International.\n\nAn image of a Sentinelese tribesman aiming a bow and arrow at a helicopter in 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nIn the wake of the ruinous 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, a member of the group was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nFirst contact was made by the British in the late 1800s, when, despite their attempts to hide, six individuals from the tribe were captured and taken to the main island of the Andaman Island archipelago. Two captured adults died of illness while the four children were returned -- perhaps also infected with illnesses that the islanders' immune systems were unequipped to deal with.\n\nAnthropological expeditions were made to tribal groups in the island chain in the 1980s and 1990s, and \"gift-dropping trips\" continued until the mid-90s, but now all contact has ceased.\n\nThe Indian government has adopted an \"'eyes-on and hands-off' policy to ensure that no poachers enter (North Sentinel Island),\" according to India's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\nTribe encounters are usually violent\n\nThe Andaman Island tribe is one of the last remaining isolated groups in the world.\n\nJonathan Mazower of Survival International, which campaigns for the protection of isolated tribes, says there are around 100 such tribes around the world. Most are found in the Amazon rainforest but there are many in New Guinea as well as in forests and islands elsewhere.\n\nWhen contact does occur, it can prove fatal -- tribespeople frequently attack intruders, and can also fall victim to common diseases like the flu, for which they have no immunity. \"Often, they are very fearful of outsiders -- with very good reason,\" Mazower said.\n\n\"Sometimes they will have in their collective memory a massacre, a violent incident, or a disease or epidemic -- so very often, there are well-founded reasons for these tribes to not want to have anything to do\" with the outside world, Mazower told CNN.\n\nWhile the Sentinelese are protected by Indian laws which make it illegal to intrude on their island, most uncontacted people do not have the same fortune, their habitats instead being encroached upon by unwelcome outsiders.\n\n\"The most important challenge, by far, is to protect their land,\" Mazower said. \"That is the absolute essential. If their lands are protected, which is their right under international law, then there is actually no reason they should not continue to survive and thrive."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Lindsey Graham says Saudi crown prince will not get a pass if 'he's making the world a more dangerous place'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/aa6C8tzQw1w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Republican Sens.

A countdown clock in Alabama. Calls and texts encouraging potential challengers in Colorado. Just a few weeks after 2018's Election Day, the signs are clear: the 2020 Senate campaigns are already underway.\n\nDemocrats start 2020 in a solid position, though they remain in the minority in the upper chamber of Congress. Of the 12 Democratic seats up for re-election, only two are from states President Donald Trump won in 2016 -- Alabama's Doug Jones and Michigan's Gary Peters. Republicans have more seats to defend , with 22 GOP seats on the line.\n\n\"The map looks good for the Democrats \u2014 I'll tell you that,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the new chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN.\n\nDemocrats will have opportunities to flip seats and potentially win back the majority in 2020. But the party could face difficult races against Republican incumbents in purple states like Maine and Colorado. Democrats will also have to defend the most vulnerable seat currently on the map in the deep red state of Alabama.\n\nRepublicans optimistic in Alabama\n\nJones hopes that his campaign playbook of running on health care, against tariffs and carefully explaining his vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will allow him to save his seat.\n\nBut Republicans are confident they can take it back, presuming they put up a significantly stronger candidate than Jones' last opponent, Roy Moore, who lost by only a point and a half despite facing accusations of sexual assault, which he denied. Even before the 2018 midterms were over, the Alabama Republican Party was counting down the days on its website until Jones \"is unseated\" in the 2020 contest.\n\nOne question looming over the race is whether Jeff Sessions, who formerly held the Senate seat, decides to run after President Donald Trump fired him as attorney general. If Sessions shows signs of entering the race, that would change the political calculus for other Republicans considering a bid.\n\nSo far, at least one potential GOP challenger is publicly weighing the possibility of a run against Jones: Rep. Bradley Byrne of Alabama.\n\nSeth Morrow, a spokesman for the congressman, told CNN that Byrne has \"made clear he is interested in running,\" but isn't expecting to reach a final decision \"until next spring at the earliest.\"\n\nSome in the state seem to think Byrne's mind is already made up. \"He's running,\" Jonathan Gray, an Alabama Republican strategist, said in an interview. \"Has Bradley announced? Not publicly. But the conversations are happening.\"\n\nSupporters have encouraged Rep. Mo Brooks to run for Senate again after he ran in the 2017 Republican primary, but the congressman has told Byrne that at this time it is \"unlikely\" he will run in 2020, an Alabama Republican close to congressman Brooks told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if he would run again, Brooks told CNN, \"Bradley Byrne looks like he's running \u2014 talk to him.\"\n\nDemocrats look for pickups\n\nWith so many seats to defend, Republicans could defeat Jones and still lose the Senate. But it would be a tough slog for Democrats, who would then need to gain even more seats to win a majority, perhaps by winning the open seat left by the retiring Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl or by defeating incumbent senators like Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nFor now, they're jockeying for the opportunity. In North Carolina, \"the name people talk about most\" is state Sen. Jeff Jackson, according to Gary Pearce, a longtime strategist in the state, who added that others, including a woman or someone of color, may also emerge.\n\nIn Arizona, Grant Woods, the former state Attorney General and former chief of staff to the late Sen. John McCain, former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, Rep. Ruben Gallego and Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor who was elected to the House in the 2018 midterms, are on the list of potential candidates Democratic strategists have mentioned.\n\nIn Colorado, Crisanta Duran, the Democratic House speaker of the state's House of Representatives and Mike Johnston, a former state senator who ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2018, both told CNN they are considering a 2020 Senate run.\n\n\"I have had a great number of folks reach out to me and ask me if I would consider running,\" Johnston said. \"There has been a big increase in phone calls and text messages since election night.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaign draws attention to Maine\n\nIn Maine, Democrats are hoping to sweep out of office Collins, who will be the only Republican in New England's 33-person congressional delegation in the next Congress. In the past year, she has infuriated both liberals and conservatives alike with her votes to send Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and save the Affordable Care Act from repeal.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kavanaugh vote, one crowdfunding campaign has raised nearly $4 million to support a future challenger to Collins.\n\n\"I think that has piqued a lot of people's interest,\" Toby McGrath, a political strategist in Maine who ran both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in the state, said of the crowdfunding efforts. \"I think a lot of people will be thinking about running.\"\n\nEven Democrats in the state privately acknowledge, however, that Collins won't be easy to defeat. The Maine Republican has successfully won election to the Senate four times already and has frequently won by wide margins. Jared Golden, a Democrat who just flipped a Republican seat in rural Maine, touted in his advertisements that he worked as an aide to Collins.\n\n\"Overall, her votes have reflected pretty squarely what her constituency is looking for,\" said Lance Dutson, a strategist who worked on previous Collins campaigns. \"And when it comes down to making these tough, 50-50 calls, I think she does what she thinks is right and then moves forward from it.\"\n\nBut should Collins decide to run for re-election, she will likely face a tough environment with national interest in her race.\n\nA number of names have been floated as potential Democratic challengers to Collins.\n\nSara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, is \"seriously considering\" running, according to spokeswoman Mary-Erin Casale.\n\nOther names that have been talked about as potential challengers are Rep. Chellie Pingree, who unsuccessfully challenged Collins in a 2002 Senate race, and Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser in the Obama administration and fueled speculation that she might enter the race after she tweeted \"me\" last month in response to a tweet asking who would run for the Senate seat. Rice later said that she was \"not making any announcements,\" but she has continued to weigh in on Twitter with commentary on Collins.\n\nOther senators to keep an eye on\n\nWhile they'd likely not change control of the Senate, there are a number of other senators whose loss would change the makeup of the chamber. First-term senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, for example, is considering a run for governor.\n\n\"I think Gov. (John Bel) Edwards is taking our state in the wrong direction, and I think based on the extensive polling that I've done and I've seen there are only two people who can beat him: one is Scalise and one is me,\" Kennedy told CNN, referring to House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, who has rejected any interest in running for governor.\n\n\"I haven't made a decision,\" Kennedy added. \"I've enjoyed being in the Senate.\"\n\nThere are also rumors of retirements surrounding some members who have roamed the halls of the Capitol for decades.\n\nThe Cook Political Report notes that seven Republicans will be 70 or older at the time of the 2020 elections: Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, Sen. Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Sen. James Risch of Idaho, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n\nUnlike McConnell, who has already made moves to run for reelection, two of the oldest senators \u2014 Roberts and Inhofe \u2014 have not said whether they'd go for another six-year term.\n\n\"The first order of business\" for Roberts is \"finishing the farm bill\" that is \"critical to our (agriculture) economy, according to spokeswoman Sarah Little. \"With the ink on the 2018 election cycle barely dry, Senator Roberts would like to give Kansans a breather before the campaigning starts all over again.\"\n\nYet at least one member of Congress would consider running if Roberts, a fourth-generation Kansan, decided to retire after serving in the House and Senate for nearly 40 years. In interviews, Kansas political strategists note that Rep. Roger Marshall would be well-positioned to take over from Roberts should he decide to retire. Former Sen. Bob Dole, as well as current senators Roberts and Jerry Moran, all represented the massive first congressional district that Marshall now serves in the House.\n\nMarshall, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has delivered more than 5,000 babies, told CNN that he and his wife \"would talk seriously about\" running if Roberts, 82, retired. Marshall added that he would \"never, ever\" run against the senator, that he doesn't see Roberts retiring in the \"near future,\" that Roberts is doing a \"great job\" especially with the Farm Bill and that he considers the senator a mentor.\n\n\"I'll cross that bridge when we get to it,\" said Marshall. \"I think Senator Roberts is not going anywhere. I just can't emphasize enough that we're fully supportive of him.\"\n\nAs for Inhofe, 84, he told CNN he's \"not necessarily\" going to run again.\n\n\"Last time I ran, all they could say is 'Inhofe you're too old to be in the United States Senate,'\" said Inhofe. \"My response was, when I'm told to fly airplanes upside down, then I'm too old to fly in the United States Senate.\"\n\nInhofe noted that he still flies upside down.\n\n\"That's right \u2014 I qualify,\" he said. \"I have not made any plans to leave.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Schiff: 'We are going to bring Whitaker before the Congress'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/K4RzofD0XpE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) California Democratic Rep.

The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report's findings run counter to President Donald Trump's consistent message that climate change is a hoax.\n\nBut the science explained in these and other federal government reports is clear: Climate change is not disproved by the extreme weather of one day or a week; it's demonstrated by long-term trends. Humans are living with the warmest temperatures in modern history . Even if the best-case scenario were to happen and greenhouse gas emissions were to drop to nothing, the world is on track to warm 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWithout significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says.\n\nThe expense\n\nThe costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield.\n\nHeat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010.\n\nRed tides, or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent. When it comes to shellfish there will be a $230 million loss by the end of the century due to ocean acidification, which is already killing off shellfish and corals.Red tides,or algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- like those that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August -- will become more frequent.\n\nImpacts on our health\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says.

Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050.\n\nDependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures.\n\nAlong the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges.\n\nEnergy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said.\n\nThe number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days.\n\nSea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater.\n\nBy midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, \"possibly significantly.\"\n\nWhat can be done\n\nThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\n\nBut the The Defense Department is trying to understand what risk climate change poses to security.But the Trump administration has signaled that the country will pull out of international initiatives like the Paris climate accord, aimed at lowering global temperatures, claiming that these treaties have been unfair for the US economy.\n\nA report from the UN in October urged all governments to take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" to avoid disaster from climate change. That report predicted that the Earth will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030. It also suggested the world faces a risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nTime for action\n\nReactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community.\n\n\"If we're going to run this country like a business, it's time to address climate as the threat multiplier we know it is before more lives are lost,\" said Robert Bullard, an environmental scientist at Texas Southern University.\n\n\"In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon.\"\n\nScientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Dimming the sun: The answer to global warming?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/Vh-333qhojg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Scientists are proposing an ingenious but as-yet-unproven way to tackle climate change: spraying sun-dimming chemicals into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe research by scientists at Harvard and Yale universities, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters , proposes using a technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection, which they say could cut the rate of global warming in half.\n\nThe technique would involve spraying large amounts of sulfate particles into the Earth's lower stratosphere at altitudes as high as 12 miles.

The aim is to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS among addicts.\n\n\"You get here, have your methadone and you are not thinking about taking drugs. You are thinking about moving your life forwards,\" says Senegalese native Moustapha Mbodj, a former heroin addict for more than 30 years.\n\nWorkshop training and activities are intended to get patients back into work.\n\nThe service available to addicts is rare in this part of the world.\n\noffering clean needles and opioid substitutes. A CEPIAD's program is the only one of its kind in Senegal, and West Africa,offering clean needles and opioid substitutes. A 2017 report showed that out of 37 nations in Africa reporting drug use data to the United Nations, just eight offer this type of therapy to addicts.\n\n\"Most users are coming here because it's the only center really,\" says Mbodj, who is 58. He began snorting heroin after traveling to Paris in his early twenties to study for a degree in technology.\n\nBy the age of 27 he was jailed for dealing cocaine and deported home after serving a three-year sentence.\n\n\"My family put a lot of hopes on me. When I started using they were extremely disappointed. There was a lot of deception,\" he recalls. On returning home to Dakar he would steal things at home to sell and buy heroin.\n\nThe entrance of CEPIAD based within the grounds of Fann hospital in downtown Dakar.\n\nA local market for opiates\n\nOver 10% of injecting users in the country are living with HIV, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates, compared with less than one percent of the general population.\n\nThe country has seen a spike in opiates trafficked on their way to Europe creating an uncommon local market over the last decade according to the UNODC.\n\n\"Often what the traffickers are doing is they are paying their support staff not only in cash but in drugs,\" Pierre Lapaque, UNODC representative for West and Central Africa, told CNN.\n\n\"It's a very smart approach because you are creating a market in a region where there was absolutely no market ten years ago and it was just a transit area.\"\n\nA voluntary survey carried out by the French National Agency for Research against AIDS unearthed more than 1,300 injecting addicts in Dakar in 2011. Previously there were no official statistics on how many people in the country were injecting drugs. A 2010 study of six states in Nigeria provided the only data for West Africa as a region.\n\nProduce grown in the garden by patients goes to the center's canteen.\n\n'Harm reduction' through free needles\n\nSenegal's government reacted with a \"harm reduction\" program when the survey was released. Back then 18,614 free needles and 17,564 condoms were handed out to addicts over a two-year period.\n\nBy December 2014, the government opened CEPIAD, offering methadone, condoms and clean needles with money from its AIDS prevention budget and training from UNODC and various international partners, including from the US and France.\n\n\"When I came in 2015,\" says Mbodj, \"it allowed me to slow my life down a little bit and have time for myself to think about things.\"\n\nLater that year and with money from the country's National AIDS Council -- CLNS -- Mbodj was able to launch a community group for addicts, Sant\u00e9 Espoir Vie (SEV), which translates as \"health, hope, life.\"\n\nThe nonprofit operates independently of CEPIAD but a few members, including Mbodj, are paid mediators recruiting new patients for the clinic.\n\nThese mediators network the city's high drug-use areas every day to connect with addicts. There are 12 mediators that go out in teams of two.\n\n\"When we go into these drug hotspots people are very comfortable with us because we used to be users. We know how to approach them,\" says Mbodj.\n\nNurse Mamadou Ka cares for a new patient who is in observation in CEPIAD.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help'\n\n\"If they miss a treatment we go to their homes. This is the social component of our jobs. We have to sit down and talk to them and re-convince them. It's a lot of back and forth,\" said Mbodj.\n\n'I have some friends on the street who could help you out' and that's when I became a sex worker Former cocaine addict, 33\n\nMany of the patients believe the treatment and therapy offered at the center has saved them. They assume without it they'd still be using, in prison perhaps, or worse.\n\n\"For me at least it saved my life,\" says one woman, 33, who didn't want to be identified because she fears for her safety.\n\nShe would burn through 100,000 West African CFA francs ($175) worth of cocaine a day, funded through prostitution.\n\nA musician friend introduced her to crack cocaine at a club when she was 20. At first he bought the drugs.\n\n\"Then he lost his job so he said 'I have some friends on the street who could help you out' and that's when I became a sex worker,\" she recounts.\n\nA former addict is nearly two years into recovery from cocaine.\n\nBy the age of 22 she was selling herself on the streets. In 2013, she was jailed for 15 days for begging in public.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help. All I was thinking about was just getting money and smoking.\"\n\nShe was at risk because of the unprotected sex and the violence that came with a drug-fueled lifestyle.\n\n\"At night sometimes thugs would follow us and steal our money, they would threaten us with knives and call us druggies,\" she says.\n\nIn 2015, she became very ill. When her sister took her to the hospital she was referred to CEPIAD for treatment and was diagnosed as HIV positive. Initially when she started treatment with counseling and drug substitution she relapsed and would still use cocaine.\n\n\"I made an agreement with the doctor that if I get married I am going to completely stop,\" she says. \"I've been married one year and eight months. I met someone here at the center. He is on methadone treatment but he's sober.\"\n\nFormer addict Esther B\u00e2, 50, takes her daily dose of methadone. She first tried heroin at the age of 18.\n\nQuitting without a substitute drug, users say, is incredibly difficult.\n\nMauama, who prefers we don't use her last name because of the stigma her family would face, knows this first-hand.\n\nShe sought exile from heroin and cocaine addiction in Touba, a holy city in the Muslim nation some 200 kilometers from Dakar.\n\n\"I went there because they have no dealers, no drugs, it's completely conservative,\" she says. \"I took [opioid painkiller] Tramadol as a substitute to stop cravings but I'd last two months and go back to Dakar, get the drugs and go back up.\"\n\nHer routine of abstinence and relapse lasted seven years. Then she met outreach workers from CEPIAD who offered her an alternative.\n\n\"I have been coming every day for two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nComprehensive treatment\n\nAt CEPIAD, psychologists and doctors provide counseling, HIV services, skills workshops and help with reintegrating into family networks.\n\nPeer support workers who are themselves former drug users also offer help along the journey to a drug-free life.\n\n\"All of those things are a good part of a comprehensive approach to treatment,\" says Robin Clark, a professor in the Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health and Quantitative Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. He focuses on substance abuse and primary care.\n\nAs well as arts therapy, counseling is available to get addicts back into work.\n\nIt is crucial for such clinics to move beyond medication, he says of the use of methadone.\n\n\"There are a lot of psychosocial support just around daily living that really good effective centers try to offer to help people re-enter normal life after they have been unemployed, many people have been in prison,\" says Clark.\n\nApart from Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius are among the only eight countries in Africa offering 'harm reduction' approaches due to lack of funding and preference for faith-based and traditional healers.\n\n\"There are still challenges,\" admits Mbayang Fall Bousso, CEPIAD's health coordinator, who calls herself the organization's temple guardian.\n\n\"It's still only in Dakar and inside a hospital so not many people know it exists.\"\n\nThose making the daily commute face logistical challenges and she wants the clinic to run nationally.\n\n\"This way we can be able to reach out to those who are still not able or willing to come,\" says Bousso. \"To reduce the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, TB and of course to reduce the amount of users.\"\n\nSince CEPIAD opened, more than 700 addicts have sought reprieve here. Now, outreach teams are targeting M'bour, about 80 kilometers south of Dakar.\n\n\"It's a beach town. It's a very touristy town too with a lot of cocaine and heroin. Consequently a lot of users,\" says Mbodj. \"Every day I meet people that I think can be helped.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving: Watch out for these illnesses tied to recalled foods", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/i0SRD3w4u3Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is many Americans' favorite holiday because it is a time when family, friends, neighbors and strangers come together to share their favorite foods. Before you prepare your favorite dishes, take a moment to review the food recalls and illness outbreaks identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nJust two days before Thanksgiving, the CDC warned US consumers to not eat romaine lettuce , as it may be contaminated with E. coli.\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC. One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople have become sick in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has identified an additional 18 people who have become sick with the same strain of E. coli in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which also is investigating the outbreak, cautions that if you have any romaine lettuce at home, you should throw it away, even if you have eaten some and did not get sick.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted Thursday that the agency continues to investigate the source of the outbreak. \"We believe it's related to lettuce harvested from California. We hope to have more information by Monday isolating the growing region.\"\n\nGottlieb said the key is to get the current stock off the market and restock with new produce. Romaine lettuce will be harvested soon in Florida, Arizona and other regions.\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce. Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nTurkey products\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak. The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Romaine' calm: Funny and meaningful memes to 'lettuce' get through this recall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/zR3r1PvT6wg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Spinach.

After two frustrating weeks in their temporary camp in a municipal sports centre, about 500 migrants joined the peaceful march, carrying banners and chanting pro-migrant slogans.\n\nOnce they managed to get past the security cordon, though, it quickly turned into a dash for the border.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they were met with force. Tear gas was fired and the US and the Mexican authorities closed the San Ysidro border crossing .\n\nThat caused long delays in both directions and angered people like Jose Fajardo.

This year, it will be raised to a new level.\n\nThis year, it looks almost certain that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will attend. But he will do so amid accusations he ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThis is the likely conclusion that US officials have reached, but the US president seems less keen to definitively say this is what happened.\n\nMr Trump will attend, as will Germany's Angela Merkel (who has attacked the Saudi explanation for the murder), France's Emmanuel Macron (whose country imposed travel bans on people suspected of being responsible for the killing) and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan (in whose country the murder took place, and from where information incriminating Saudi Arabia has leaked).\n\nPlenty of world leaders will not want to be caught in photo opportunities cosying up to the crown prince. And plenty could happen on the sidelines, the consequences of which will slowly become clear.\n\n2) Lights out on one island?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nAll the electricity on one British island could be turned off at the end of the week.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nAbout 500 people live on the island of Sark in the English Channel, and one official there says they will all have to adopt \"a bit of a wartime mentality\" from this week.\n\nOn Friday, the island's electricity provider will withdraw its services. This is because it was ordered to reduce its prices earlier this year, a situation it says has caused it to lose a significant amount of money.\n\nThere was some concern all the residents may be forced to evacuate, but that looks unlikely to happen now. But they are having to find whatever alternative they can to keep the lights on - including an emergency generator and a plan to share whatever renewable energy is created on the island.\n\n3) All eyes on Mississippi\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nThree weeks on, the US mid-term elections are still not over. When people in Mississippi voted to pick one of the state's two senators on 6 November, no one candidate gained an overall majority. So now there will be another vote.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nAfter the mid-terms, Republicans have 49 Senate seats, and Democrats 43. Whatever happens on Tuesday, Republicans will still have more seats, but if Democrats are able to flip this seat in Mississippi, it could make it just a bit more complicated for Donald Trump's agenda to pass through the Senate.\n\nRepublican contender Cindy Hyde-Smith hasn't made things particularly easy for herself in the past few weeks, especially if she had any hope of capturing African-American votes.\n\nFirst, she was filmed making a joke about public hangings, in a state where African-Americans were lynched in the past (Hyde-Smith later apologised for any offence caused).\n\nThen, she appeared to crack another joke, about trying to suppress the registration of some of her opponent's voters.\n\nThe opponent in question, Mike Epsy, would be the first African-American senator in Mississippi. And while it's still unlikely Epsy will win, President Trump is coming to town to support his candidate. Just in case.\n\n4) Crunch moment for climate\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nThe 24th UN Climate Change Conference starts in Katowice, Poland, on Sunday.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nBack in 2015, in a historic deal, world leaders agreed a framework for combating climate change. Three years on, they're still struggling to agree how to put that plan into practice, and the Katowice talks hope to move the discussion further along.\n\nFor those developing countries keen for financial help to battle a worsening climate, time is of the essence.\n\nThe task has been made even more difficult by President Trump saying he intends to withdraw the US from the pact.\n\nBut now, it's also been reported that the Trump administration will host a side-event promoting the use of fossil fuels, as they did during last year's talks in Bonn, Germany.\n\nIt didn't go down very well then, either.\n\n5) Clash of the titans\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption British heavyweight Tyson Fury (L) is confronted by Deontay Wilder\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nAmerican boxer Deontay Wilder will put his world heavyweight championship on the line against Tyson Fury on Saturday.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nIf you're into boxing, this is the real deal: one of the most hotly-anticipated heavyweight bouts in years.\n\nBoth men are undefeated, and the winner will be at the front of the queue to face Anthony Joshua, who holds the rest of the world heavyweight titles.\n\nIf Fury wins in Los Angeles, it would mark the culmination of a remarkable journey.\n\nAfter becoming world champion in 2015, the Brit spent two and a half years out of the ring, was treated for depression, and (in his own words) \"ballooned up to 28 stone (392 lbs)\".\n\nNow, he has reportedly lost 10 stone, and says he's in the best shape of his life. On Saturday, the boxing world will find out if that is enough."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Matthew Hedges: British academic pardoned by UAE", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46341310", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:29", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright EPA/DANIELA TEJADA Image caption Matthew Hedges was jailed in the UAE for spying\n\nBritish academic Matthew Hedges, who was jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates, has been pardoned with immediate effect.\n\nMr Hedges, 31, denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD, but prosecutors said he confessed.\n\nHis wife, Daniela Tejada, who appealed for clemency, told Reuters that she \"cannot wait to have Matt back home\".\n\nThe UAE said the pardon was part of a series of orders issued on the country's National Day anniversary.\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the pardon \"fantastic news\".\n\nProsecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the charges in an Abu Dhabi court, which found him guilty of \"spying for or on behalf of\" the UK government, and was jailed for life last week.\n\nMr Hedges had always said he was innocent, and had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University.\n\nMr Hunt tweeted: \"Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges.\n\n\"Although we didn't agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Jeremy_Hunt Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges.Although we didn\u2019t agree with charges we are grateful to UAE govt for resolving issue speedily.But also a bittersweet moment as we remember Nazanin &other innocent ppl detained in Iran.Justice won\u2019t be truly done until they too are safely home. \u2014 Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) November 26, 2018 Report\n\nMr Hedges' family previously said that during the first six weeks of his detention he had been interrogated without a lawyer and consular access was unavailable.\n\nDespite not speaking Arabic, he was made to sign a document which transpired to be a confession, they added.\n\nMs Tejada said her husband had been left \"absolutely terrified\" by the prospect of serving a life sentence in the UAE and was suffering panic attacks.\n\nMr Hedges, who lives in Exeter, was arrested at Dubai Airport in May."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: Back my deal or risk more division, May to tell MPs", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46336772", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:30", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: \"I will make the case for this deal with all my heart\"\n\nRejecting the Brexit deal will be risky and lead to \"division and uncertainty\", Prime Minister Theresa May will say to MPs who oppose her plan.\n\nHer Commons speech comes after the 27 other EU leaders approved the terms of the UK's exit at a summit on Sunday.\n\nMrs May now has to persuade politicians in the UK Parliament to back the deal.\n\nBut cabinet ministers admit she faces an uphill struggle, with Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs set to vote against it.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will review its parliamentary pact with the Conservatives - which props up Mrs May's government - if the deal is approved by MPs.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said his party will oppose the deal, calling it \"the worst of all worlds\".\n\nThe prime minister has pledged to put her \"heart and soul\" into a two-week push to convince MPs to back the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and its future relations with the bloc.\n\nParliament will decide whether to accept or reject the package next month, in a vote which is likely to be on 12 December.\n\nHer campaign - which saw her appeal to the public in a \"letter to the nation\" at the weekend - could also include a TV debate with Mr Corbyn, the Daily Telegraph has reported.\n\nThe newspaper said Mrs May - who refused to take part in a head-to-head debate with the Labour leader before the 2017 general election - will challenge Mr Corbyn. Labour says he would \"relish\" a debate.\n\nIn her Commons statement on Monday, expected to begin at about 15:30 GMT, Mrs May will say that backing the deal would bring an end to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.\n\n\"Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest,\" she will say.\n\nShe will tell MPs to choose whether they want to back the deal and \"move on to building a brighter future of opportunity\" or reject it and \"go back to square one\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mrs May's Tory critics include Brexiteer MPs David Davis, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, as well as Remainers Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve and Jo Johnson\n\nThe prime minister, who will chair a meeting of her cabinet on Monday morning, will say she is \"absolutely\" sure there is no better deal on offer.\n\nHer fellow EU leaders made it \"very clear\" there would be no further negotiations if the deal is rejected, she is expected to add.\n\nOn Sunday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said anyone in Britain who thought the EU might offer better terms would be \"disappointed\" because this was the \"only\" deal.\n\nBut critics dispute that argument, saying the PM has capitulated on key issues and the EU would be willing to give ground to avoid a no-deal exit.\n\nThey are especially unhappy with deal around the issue of the Irish backstop - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - which aims to avoid the need for physical checks of people and goods at the border on the island of Ireland.\n\nThe backstop plan involves a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. It would also see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020.\n\nOpponents fear these proposals mean the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. The DUP accuse her of breaking her promise to them that Northern Ireland would never be treated any differently from the rest of the UK.\n\nAnalysis: 'No 10's carefully designed script'\n\nBy BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\n\nNo 10 is all too aware it is waging this campaign for its compromise against a wall of resistance.\n\nThere are doubts about elements of the deal inside cabinet, and the Tory backbenches are riddled with concerns.\n\nThe opposition parties and her supposed partners in government - the DUP - are all, so far, set against.\n\nBut the prime minister's chosen - and perhaps only realistic - political option at this moment is to keep pushing on with a deal that she believes allows us to leave the European Union without hurting the economy while putting the UK in charge of its own immigration policy.\n\nThere's irritation in government about the French president's warning over the long-term control of fishing rights.\n\nNoises off from other EU leaders who tried in the main to show a helpful face in Brussels yesterday are not part of Number 10's carefully designed script.\n\nThe leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries have made clear they still hope to negotiate fishing access in UK waters based on existing rights.\n\nAt the EU summit, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that if, in future talks, the UK was unwilling to make compromises over fishing, the negotiations for a wider trade deal could be slowed down, which could potentially lead to the last-resort backstop plan coming into force.\n\nWriting in Monday's Daily Mail, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged his colleagues who are considering opposing the deal to \"think again\", adding the public \"might not forgive us\".\n\nBut in the Daily Telegraph, deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds said the deal was \"Brexit in name only\" and the government must return to negotiations \"rather than waste any more time\".\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if Mrs May's deal was voted down by Parliament, she would either have to re-negotiate or \"there really ought to be a general election\" because she had \"failed so badly in these negotiations\".\n\nAnalysis commissioned by the People's Vote campaign - which wants another referendum on Brexit - claimed the deal would leave the UK \u00a3100bn a year worse off by 2030 than it would be if it had stayed in the European Union.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, whether the deal is sanctioned or not.\n\nEU leaders approved two key Brexit documents at the summit: the 599-page, legally-binding withdrawal agreement which sets out the terms of the UK's exit, and also the political declaration which sets out what the future UK-EU relationship might be like.\n\nIf the agreement passes through the UK Parliament, it needs to go back to the European Council for a vote and then be ratified by the European Parliament."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-46296249", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:31", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover\n\nMore than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks.

It is less common in women who have been through the menopause\n\nIt is a long-term condition that can have a significant impact on your life, but there are treatments that can help\n\nSymptoms include: Pain in your lower tummy or back (pelvic pain) - usually worse during your period; pain when going to the toilet during your period; feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your urine during your period; difficulty getting pregnant\n\nFor some women, endometriosis can have a big impact on their life and may sometimes lead to feelings of depression\n\nDiagnosis and surgery\n\nMs Roach had surgery following the diagnosis.\n\n\"Half of my left side of my organs had all fused together [because of scarring and adhesions]. I had cysts, I had internal bleeding. I had all kinds of things going on that I didn't anticipate,\" she said.\n\nShe had a second surgery for gallstone and gall bladder removal after problems caused by hormones she was taking, and a third after her pain recurred.\n\nDespite having the diagnosis, five GPs had said there was no underlying physical cause and it was only when she paid for a private scan that a large cyst was found and removed.\n\nImage copyright Alex Roach Image caption Alex Roach has undergone three operations due to the condition\n\nMs Roach, a member of the Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales group whose research led to the Welsh Government investigation, said it was vital there was greater understanding of the impact the disease had on the lives of the one-in-10 women it affected.\n\nShe missed lectures in university, had to sit exams shortly after surgery and had to scale down her hopes of getting a first-class degree. She was also told the condition had affected her chances of promotion at work.\n\nShe also knows she is likely to need surgery in the future and does not know how her chances of having children will be affected, adding her partner had \"been to hell and back with me\".\n\n\"There needs to be a recognition that there isn't enough being done to recognise and diagnose the disease. It's horrendous being in pain but it's even worse when you have no idea why,\" Ms Roach said.\n\n\"It's the leading cause for infertility and it would make a huge difference to my life, to so many different women's lives, if diagnosis could happen earlier and the damage prevented and the fertility preserved.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe report found current provision across all levels of service from GPs to specialists was not meeting need, and a lack of understanding of the condition led to delays in diagnosis, poor management of symptoms and negative outcomes for patients.\n\nThe report makes a number of proposals, including:\n\nEarly education in menstrual well-being from primary school age onwards and timely response to symptoms by GPs, with onwards referral for further investigation with an endometriosis specialist gynaecologist if necessary\n\nEach health board in Wales should identify one or more endometriosis consultant leads and provide a specialist nurse.

This could come back within the first 30 minutes on the surface.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption InSight will be using technologies that were proven on the 2007 Phoenix mission\n\nWhat is different about this mission?\n\nThis will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior.\n\nScientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal.\n\nThe first is a package of Franco-British seismometers that will be lifted on to the surface to listen for \"Marsquakes\". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of.\n\nA German \"mole\" will burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is.\n\nAnd the third experiment will use radio transmissions to very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: \"If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information.\"\n\nWhy do we need to know this?\n\nScientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time.\n\nInSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: \"The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bruce Banerdt: \"Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Tossing dead salmon is good for plants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46305004", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption For more than 20 years, students in a small corner of north-west US have been tossing dead fish\n\nNever mind silver bells and cockleshells, Mary should have tossed dead fish to help her garden grown.\n\nA team of US researchers has found that sockeye salmon carcasses has helped boost tree growth by up to 20%.\n\nOver a 20-year period, students from the University of Washington tossed dead fish from a stream on to a river bank.\n\nData shows the nutrients from the rotting flesh boosted growth in the area's trees.\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption Pacific salmon die shortly after returning to rivers to spawn\n\nWhat did the scientists do?\n\nFor two decades, students taking part in a long-term study on who/what was eating sockeye salmon in a stream in Alaska have been tossing fish carcasses on to one river bank in order to avoid double counting them during surveys.\n\n\"We would find carcasses on both sides of the stream, explained Prof Tom Quinn, who supervised the study.\n\n\"But we always tossed the carcasses on one side of the stream so effectively we were reducing the density of carcasses on one side and increasing the density of carcasses on the other.\n\n\"It was something of a natural fertilisation experiment.\"\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption In order to avoid counting carcasses twice, dead fish were hurled to a river bank\n\nWhat did they find?\n\nAfter taking samples from the surrounding trees of Hansen Creek, the scientists found that the fish carcasses (almost 300 tons over the 20-year period) had affected the growth rate of the trees.\n\n\"We took cores from live trees that we estimated to be at least 40 years old,\" observed Prof Quinn.\n\n\"We saw that the effect of the carcass manipulation was to accelerate the growth on that side.\n\n\"There was a significant increase in the growth of the trees on the side that we fertilised relative to how well they have been doing prior to the experiment.\"\n\nImage copyright Dan Dinicola Image caption Indigenous people have known for generations about the benefits fish carcasses provide\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nProf Quinn said the study highlighted the importance of long-term studies when observing ecological changes or influences because changes, such as dead fish fertilising soil, would not be detected in shorter studies."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Whale stranding in New Zealand leaves 145 dead", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46339763", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Almost 150 whales die in mass stranding\n\nA group of up to 145 pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on Stewart Island in New Zealand.\n\nThe animals were discovered by a walker late on Saturday, strewn along the beach of Mason Bay.\n\nAuthorities said half the whales had already died by then, while the other half were put down as it would have been too difficult to save them.\n\nIn separate incidents, 12 pygmy whales and a sperm whale also beached in New Zealand over the weekend.\n\n'A heart-breaking decision'\n\nThe pilot whales were beached in two pods about 2km (1.2 miles) apart on a remote beach on Rakiura or Stewart Island off the coast of South Island.\n\n\"Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low,\" Ren Leppens of the regional Department of Conservation (DOC) said in a statement.\n\n\"The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise.\"\n\n\"However, it's always a heart-breaking decision to make.\"\n\nThe DOC said in a statement that whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand and that there are about 85 incidents a year.

It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida.\n\nAnd, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation.\n\nWith warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life.\n\nThe White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate.\n\nSpokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was \"largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population\".\n\nThe world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity.\n\nWhat does the report say?\n\nThe US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society.\n\n\"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,\" the report says.\n\n\"Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.\"\n\nThe report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events.\n\nBut it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and \"to adapt to the changes that will occur\".\n\nWhat reaction has there been?\n\nEnvironmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action.\n\nBrenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not \"some problem in the distant future\".\n\n\"It's happening right now in every part of the country,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September\n\nThat view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice.\n\n\"While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,\" she said.\n\nFormer US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season.\n\n\"Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,\" Mr Gore said.\n\n\"The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.\"\n\nWhat does President Trump say about climate change?\n\nIn October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a \"political agenda\", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures.\n\nAfter taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAt the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.\n\nDuring his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was \"a hoax\". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: \"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.\"\n\nHow great is the climate threat?\n\nA report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes.\n\nThat means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops.\n\nIf the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Amazon rainforest deforestation 'worst in 10 years', says Brazil", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46327634", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The government blamed illegal logging for the rise\n\nDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has hit its highest rate in a decade, according to official data.\n\nAbout 7,900 sq km (3,050 sq miles) of the world's largest rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018 - an area roughly five times the size of London.\n\nEnvironment Minister Edson Duarte said illegal logging was to blame.\n\nThe figures come amid concerns about the policies of Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nDuring the 2018 election campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging forestry and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency.\n\nAn aide for the president-elect has also announced the administration will merge the agriculture and environment ministries, which critics say could endanger the rainforest.\n\nThe latest government data says most of the deforestation occurred in the states of Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1, and marked a 13.7% rise over last year's figures.\n\nMato Grosso is the top producer of grains in Brazil, and critics say expanding agriculture is also encroaching on the rainforest.\n\nMr Duarte blamed \"an upsurge in organised crime\" for the illegal deforestation, and said the country must broaden the fight against \"environmental violations and in defence of sustainable development of the biome\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Amazon is sometimes called the lungs of the planet\n\nSatellite data from the deforestation monitoring project known as Prodes informed the annual survey.\n\nWhile the rate does mark a significant rise from last year, when the rate of deforestation dropped 16% in a 12-month period, it still marks a 72% drop from 2004, when the Brazilian federal government launched measures to combat deforestation.\n\nIn that year, an area the size of Haiti - more than 27,000 sq km - was cleared from the rainforest.\n\nThe Amazon region holds the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is home to plant and animal species that are still being discovered by scientists.\n\nMost of its millions of square kilometres are inside Brazil, where under laws dating back to 1965, landowners must keep a percentage of their property forested."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Modern-Day Rudy Fulfills Dream Of Showering With Notre Dame Football Team", "article_link": "https://sports.theonion.com/modern-day-rudy-fulfills-dream-of-showering-with-notre-1830627943", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:06", "body_paragraphs": "NOTRE DAME, IN\u2014Welling up with emotion upon finally setting foot on the hallowed tile surface, college senior Anthony Harper fulfilled his lifelong dream Saturday after finally being allowed to shower with the Notre Dame football team. \u201cA lot of people told me I would never make it into these showers, but I knew that if I worked hard and never quit, I have what it takes to strip down and lather up with Notre Dame football,\u201d said Harper, who received an ovation from the team after coach Brian Kelly tossed him some conditioner and told him to \u201cget on in there.\u201d \u201cEvery week for the last three years, I would sit on the bench in this locker room and watch the team shower, wishing I could be in there with them.

For them, Hebron is more important than Jerusalem.\"\n\nWhen former Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced in October that another settlement had been approved to be built in Hebron for the first time in more than 20 years, the news wasn't a surprise for the Ewaiwes.\n\nOver the decades in Hebron, as illegal settlements were built in the heart of the city, the Ewaiwe family saw the city centre - once bustling with markets, shops and factories - disintegrate into a ghost town as poverty increased among its residents.\n\nIllegal settlements have been expanding across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, for decades, but there has been no accountability.\n\nThe latest settlement project - the sixth in Hebron's H2 district under Israeli military control - will be built on a former Israeli army base, comprising 31 settler homes at a cost of $6.1m in government funding.\n\nSurging settlements\n\nIt has been 50 years since Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the 1967 war, making it the longest lasting military occupation in the world, with no end in sight.\n\nOccupation and colonialism are legally justified only as a \"short-term and abnormal condition that is leading unhesitatingly towards self-determination and sovereignty\", Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote in his 2017 report to the General Assembly.\n\nYet, there has been a surge of tenders for settlement construction in the past two years since US President Donald Trump took office, according to Israeli organisation Peace Now.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018 there were tenders for 3,154 and 3,167 settlement housing units, respectively, compared with just 42 in 2016.\n\nIn March 2017, after two decades, the Israeli security cabinet announced plans to build a new settlement in the occupied West Bank.\n\nCurrently, there are some 600,000-750,000 illegal settlers living in about 150 settlements across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, built on land the Palestinians had envisioned for a future state.\n\nIt's a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, according to the UN, which forbids states from transferring their citizens to occupied land, as well as a presumptive war crime under the 1998 Statute of Rome that set up the International Criminal Court.\n\nAccording to Lynk, the two-state solution is on \"life support with a fading pulse\" and Israel's occupation has crossed the red line into illegality.\n\nLast month in a report to the General Assembly, he urged the international community to take action to stop Israel's annexation of the West Bank with its settlement expansion and annexation laws adopted since the beginning of 2017.\n\nFailing to do so will likely prompt Israel to formalise annexation into domestic law, Lynk warned, adding that most Israeli cabinet ministers have advocated for some form of annexation of the West Bank.\n\nMarking the 50th anniversary of Israel's occupation of the West Bank in 2017, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to never remove the illegal settlements.\n\n\"We are here to stay, forever,\" Netanyahu told settlers at the event. \"We will deepen our roots, build, strengthen and settle.\"\n\n'Annexation is in the air'\n\nWith its legislative measures that sought to apply Israeli law to the West Bank and the 2017 settlement regularisation law, which retroactively legalises settlements, Lynk told Al Jazeera that Israel is moving rapidly towards the stage where it may state that it will annex parts of the West Bank.\n\n\"I think annexation is in the air\u2026 Israel is being particularly bold over the last 20 months in accelerating the patterns of annexation. Indeed, I think we're at a stage where occupation is becoming indistinguishable from annexation,\" Lynk said.\n\nIsrael hasn't complied with more than 40 resolutions of the UN Security Council and about 100 resolutions of the General Assembly.\n\nThe Security Council needs to make sure that Israel complies with its obligations as a UN member under international law, Lynk said.\n\n\"Israel doesn't need to declare formal annexation for its annexation steps to be unlawful under international law, as long as it is taking steps to ensure the permanency of its settlements and trying to establish sovereign facts on the ground. That is sufficient for it to be illegal under international law,\" Lynk said.\n\nThe newest settlement to be built in Hebron is yet another reaffirmation of Israel's intention to remain permanently in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, Lynk said.\n\nFor Zleikha Muhtaseb, director of a women's cooperative in Hebron's H2, she worries the new settlement will bring more restrictions for Palestinians living and working nearby.\n\n\"We're worried because they keep expanding\u2026 With the new settlement, it will cause more violence. We already have very extreme settlers, but you never know how extreme the newcomers will be.\n\n\"The women's centre will be very close to the settlement; I think we will be in danger.\"\n\nLike the Ewaiwe family, the balcony in her house has also been fortified with a metal grid to prevent settlers from breaking in.\n\nFor the Ewaiwes, when settlers aren't paying them visits, then it's the Israeli forces. Last month they were renovating rooms on the ground floor to provide a home for their engaged son as he cannot afford to pay rent elsewhere.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nBut Israeli forces soon arrived and banned any renovation under a military order. They stacked up sandbags blocking access to the upper floor and set up barbed wire for extra measure.\n\nTheir son's wedding was planned for December but it has been delayed until they can find a solution.\n\nFor the Ewaiwes, the only way to deal with their difficult situation is to be patient. There is little else they can do.\n\n\"Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah [all thanks are to God],\" Nidal said, regarding their situation. \"What can we say about our life? We're alive.\n\n\"Despite the bad situation we're still living in our home\u2026 God helps us.\""}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Why is Pakistan reluctant to bring Lashkar-e-Taiba to justice?", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/pakistan-reluctant-bring-lashkar-taiba-justice-181121143620490.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Ten years ago today, India's financial capital Mumbai was rocked by gunfire and explosions. The attack lasted four days and left over 160 people dead. In the subsequent investigations, Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed, two leaders of Pakistan-based armed group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), were named as the suspected masterminds of the attack.\n\nIn December 2008, the Pakistani authorities arrested Lakhvi and kept him behind bars until 2015, when a local court released him on bail due to \"insufficient evidence\" provided against him.\n\nSaeed was put under house arrest following the Mumbai attacks but was set free in 2009. In 2012, the United States announced a $10m reward for any information that leads to his capture.\n\nOver the past decade and a half, LeT has gone through various transformations as it came under international and domestic pressure. Organisations affiliated with LeT include Jamat-ud-Dawa, Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation and Tehreek-e-Azadi Jammu and Kashmir - all led by Saeed.\n\nDespite all these name changes, the core of the LeT is very much alive and its activities extend across the country. So 10 years after the Mumbai attacks, why is Pakistan still unable to contain the movement?\n\nSecret ties\n\nMany believe the secret relationship between the Pakistani intelligence and the LeT - which was exposed during the subsequent investigations in India and the US - is the main reason behind Pakistan's reluctance to stamp out the movement. It is alleged that because of the support of the security apparatus for the group, no solid action has been taken against LeT. And there is very little the civilian authorities can do, even if they want to take action against the group.\n\nThe former head of the Federal Investigation Authority of Pakistan, Tariq Khosa, wrote in 2015 that even though his agency had uncovered enough evidence to prove the LeT was behind the Mumbai attacks, the courts had failed to convict anyone for the crime.\n\nPoliticians who have tried to push for the organisation to be held accountable have gotten in trouble. After Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif implied that the LeT was behind the Mumbai attacks in an interview with local newspaper Dawn earlier this year, a Pakistani court initiated a treason case against him and the journalist who published the interview for defaming national institutions.\n\nWhile those who question the group's actions and ability to operate with impunity are being harassed, the LeT continues to expand its footprint in the country under different guises, using charity organisations as fronts.\n\nOne such front, Jamat-ud-Dawa recently launched a political party called Milli Muslim League, allegedly as part of a military plan to push such groups into mainstream politics.\n\nThe party has not secured official registration with the Election Commission of Pakistan, but it openly backed candidates that contested the July general elections and performed much better than traditional political parties in some areas of the country - such as in Lahore where Sheikh Muhammad Yaqoub secured more votes than the Pakistan People's Party candidate Zubair Kardar. So how did the LeT manage to gain the trust of so many Pakistani citizens?\n\nLeT recruitment among Pakistan's poor\n\nThe tacit support LeT receives from the powerful military, which in many ways runs a \"parallel government\" in Pakistan, allows the organisation to operate freely in all corners of the country. The group focuses its efforts on areas where vulnerable Pakistanis are looking for help with subsistence.\n\nI have followed the group closely during my reporting missions in the country, and have seen how they run an expansive network of charity organisations. While this is a front that they use to justify their continued presence, it is also a way to win hearts and minds of Pakistanis, who they recruit for their political causes.\n\nI saw this happening multiple times, especially in the aftermath of natural disasters. The Pakistani state lacks the infrastructure to help its population in the aftermath of such disasters and it appears to have outsourced this role to such \"charity\" groups.\n\nDuring a reporting trip to south of Punjab province following a flood in 2014, I witnessed members of the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation helping out the affected population by bringing them food and providing them with shelter. When I asked one of them about their motives, he told me that their primary aim was \"to find new recruits for their movement\".\n\nIt is unlikely that the Pakistani authorities, and particularly the military, are unaware of LeT's recruitment activities among the poor. But the group is perceived to be focused on \"external enemies\" - i.e. to be practising its militancy elsewhere - and hence to pose no immediate threat to Pakistan.\n\nThis is why the LeT is allowed to operate freely to this day. And this is why we are yet to see any concrete action taken against those who are known to be masterminds of the Mumbai attack.\n\nBut this policy of allowing \"outward-looking\" militancy to continue to exist might soon backfire. In recent times, many former LeT operatives have joined other armed groups, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), that consider Pakistan an enemy and carry out attacks on Pakistani soil against the Pakistani population.\n\nFurthermore, we cannot possibly expect that instability and militancy in neighbouring countries will not eventually cross back into our territory and affect us as well.\n\nA decade after the Mumbai attacks, it really is time for Pakistan to change its policies and stop allowing hate groups to prosper within its borders. If it fails to take action, the likes of the LeT will continue to radicalise the Pakistani youth, push them towards violence and eventually harm the Pakistani society itself.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Health crisis: Papua New Guinea fights tuberculosis menace", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/health-crisis-papua-guinea-fights-tuberculosis-menace-181126082005786.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Earlier this month, world leaders assembled in Papua New Guinea for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit - the biggest event in the country's history.\n\nHowever, government critics say hosting the APEC summit was a costly affair, especially when the country faces many challenges.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:19", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Tariffs Tapping Into US Craft Beer Industry", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4673807.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move by the Trump administration to bolster the domestic industry and protect U.S. jobs, are just starting to have a far-reaching impact on different sectors of the U.S. economy, including the growing craft beer industry.

Moss had also fined Papadopoulos $9,500 and ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service.\n\nMoss also noted that two other judges had already upheld the constitutionality of Mueller's appointment and said there was only a \"remote\" chance that the new challenge would end with a \"contrary conclusion.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Papadopoulos is a relatively minor figure in the 18-month Mueller investigation.

Three employees had to pull the boy off a fence and carry him back into a building.\n\n\u200b14,000 children detained\n\nRecords obtained by The Associated Press highlight some of the problems that plague government facilities for immigrant youths at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been making moves in recent weeks that could send even more migrant children into detention.\n\nAbout 14,000 immigrant children are detained in more than 100 facilities nationally, with about 5,900 in Texas. Many crossed the border without their parents and are having to wait longer in detention to be placed with relatives or sponsors, who are being dissuaded to come forward out of fear they\u2019ll be arrested and deported.\n\nHundreds of children who were separated from their parents earlier this year were also detained in these facilities, but most of them have since been released to their parents.\n\nOvertaxed system\n\nAmid the global uproar over family separation, the Trump administration presented the facilities as caring, safe places for immigrant children.\n\nBut as records obtained by the AP show, the child detention system is overtaxed. Children are acting out, sometimes hitting each other and trying to escape, and staff members struggle to deal with escalating problems.\n\nDoctors have warned for months about the consequences of detaining children for long periods of time, particularly after most of them had fled violence and poverty in Central America and undertaken the dangerous journey to the U.S.\n\n\u201cBeing in detention can be a form of trauma,\u201d said Dr. Alan Shapiro, a pediatrician who works directly with immigrant children. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat children for trauma while we\u2019re traumatizing them at the same time.\u201d\n\nSexual abuse in Arizona\n\nSouthwest Key Programs, a Texas-based nonprofit, operates the facilities where the three incidents occurred. In Arizona, the organization agreed in October to close two facilities and stop accepting more children at others as part of a settlement with the state, which was investigating whether the organization conducted adequate background checks of staff. One former employee was convicted this year of sexually abusing multiple boys.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, Southwest Key is pushing to expand. It has sued Houston after local officials tried to stop the opening of a facility.\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it reported all three incidents on its own and that it was committed to correcting any problems.\n\n\u201cAs long as immigrant children are forced to leave their homes due to violence and poverty, we want to provide them with compassionate care and help reunify them with family safely and quickly,\u201d the group said.\n\nSouthwest Key\u2019s facilities are licensed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which inspects child detention centers and released inspection records to the AP.\n\nThe U.S. government has also set up a temporary facility in Tornillo, Texas, that isn\u2019t licensed by the state because it\u2019s located on federal property. There, roughly 1,800 children are housed in large tents at much higher costs than the licensed facilities. That\u2019s up from 320 in June, at the height of the family separation crisis.\n\nRepeated investigations\n\nOne facility that was repeatedly flagged was Casa El Presidente in Brownsville, Texas, operated by Southwest Key.\n\nAs parents were being arrested and separated from their infants and young children, Casa El Presidente became one of three Texas \u201ctender age\u201d facilities that took in their kids. A group of congressmen who visited in June said the facility had an infant room with high chairs and toys, where staff members were caring for babies.\n\nCasa El Presidente multiplied in size during the family separation crisis. According to the state\u2019s monthly head counts, the facility went from 56 children in June to 367 in the most recent count taken Nov. 15.\n\nA shift supervisor told a state inspector June 26 that more staff were quitting and that workers \u201cstruggle with implementing healthy boundaries for children of this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe admitted staff are afraid to touch the children,\u201d the inspector wrote in a report.\n\nThe supervisor said Casa El Presidente had to change its policy on restraining young children who were misbehaving, because holding them for too short a time was \u201cescalating instead of de-escalating.\u201d Southwest Key said an example of a typical restraint would be holding a child\u2019s arm or shoulder, and that it doesn\u2019t use mechanical restraints.\n\nThe facility was cited for improperly restraining a 6-year-old boy who tried in July to climb a playground fence and run away.\n\nThe boy was identified in an inspection report by his first name, Osman. Staff members told an inspector that two days before Osman ran to the fence, two other boys had placed his shoes in a toilet. Osman \u201calso expressed frustration about being in the shelter away from his family,\u201d the report said.\n\nThree staff members eventually carried Osman away from the fence and back into the building.\n\nThe same month, two boys named Luis and Franklin got into a fight after Luis apparently kicked a soccer ball that Franklin said belonged to him. An inspector who viewed the facility\u2019s video wrote that Franklin chased Luis and punched him, causing Luis to fall.\n\n\u201cFranklin starts to kick him, once again making contact and kicking Luis in the face,\u201d the inspector wrote. Employees \u201cnever make efforts to move Franklin away from Luis; the staff just hold him.\u201d\n\nThe inspector cited the facility for not properly intervening to stop the kicks.\n\nAt Casa Rio Grande in San Benito, Texas, one of the people living there was a 20-year-old who told the staff she was 17. An investigation report identified her as Julia.\n\nJulia told an inspector that she took a needle from a sewing class and used it to cut herself because \u201cshe felt alone.\u201d She hid her wrist for around two weeks under a sweater, but when she forgot to wear her sweater one day, a staff member spotted the marks.\n\nIn each case, inspectors interviewed other minors detained at the facility. According to the reports, the other youths said they were treated well, had enough food, and felt respected by the staff.\n\nJeff Eller, a spokesman for Southwest Key, acknowledged that staff morale has suffered this year because of the unprecedented demands.\n\n\u201cWe are against family separations at the border,\u201d Eller said. \u201cKeeping families together is better for the children, parents, and communities.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Memos to Nobody: Inside the Work of a Neglected Fed Agency", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/merit-systems-protection-board-mark-robbins-us-agency/4672801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Mark Robbins gets to work at 8:15 each morning and unlocks the door to his office suite. He switches on the lights and the TV news, brews a pot of coffee and pulls out the first files of the day to review.\n\nFor the next eight hours or so, he reads through federal workplace disputes, analyzes the cases, marks them with notes and logs his legal opinions. When he's finished, he slips the files into a cardboard box and carries them into an empty room where they will sit and wait. For nobody.\n\nHe's at 1,520 files and counting.\n\nSuch is the lot of the last man standing in this forgotten corner of Donald Trump's Washington. For nearly two years, while Congress has argued and the White House has delayed, Robbins has waited to be sent some colleagues to read his work and rule on the cases. No one has arrived. So he toils in vain, writing memos into the void.\n\nRobbins is a one-man microcosm of a current strand of government dysfunction. His office isn't a high-profile political target. No politician has publicly pledged to slash his budget. But his agency's work has effectively been neutered through neglect. Promising to shrink the size of government, the president has been slow to fill posts and the Republican-led Congress has struggled to win approval for nominees. The combined effect isn't always dramatic, but it's strikingly clear when examined up close.\n\n\"It's a series of unfortunate events,'' says Robbins, who has had plenty of time to contemplate the absurdity of his situation. Still, he doesn't blame Trump or the government for his predicament. \"There's no one thing that created this problem that could have been fixed. It was a series of things randomly thrown together to create where we are.''\n\nRobbins is a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, a quasi-judicial federal body designed to determine whether civil servants have been mistreated by their employers. The three members are presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed for staggered seven-year terms. After one member termed out in 2015 and a second did so in January 2017, both without replacements lined up, Robbins became the sole member and acting chairman. The board needs at least two members to decide cases.\n\nThat's a problem for the federal workers and whistleblowers whose 1,000-plus grievances hang in the balance, stalled by the board's inability to settle them. When Robbins' term ends on March 1, the board probably will sit empty for the first time in its 40-year history.\n\nIt's also a problem for Robbins. A new board, whenever it's appointed and approved, will start from scratch. That means while new members can read Robbins' notes, his thousand-plus decisions will simply vanish.\n\n\"There is zero chance, zero chance my votes will count,'' the 59-year-old lawyer says, running his fingers over the spines leather-bound volumes lined up neatly on a shelf. Inside are the board's published rulings. None of the opinions he's working on will make it into one of them.\n\n\"Imagine having the last year and half of your work just ... disappear,'' he said.\n\nDespite the choke of files piled up everywhere else, Robbins' office is remarkably orderly. Three paperweights rest on stacks of papers on his desk: a stone from Babel province, a memento from his time working for the State Department in Iraq; a model of the White House, to commemorate his tenure under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush; and a medallion bearing the merit board's seal. This job, which pays about $155,000 a year, \"has been the honor of my life,'' he says.\n\nIn the corner, a potted plant he rescued from a trash can outside his condo six years ago is now so tall that it's bumping up against the ceiling, growing in circles.\n\nHe swears it's not a metaphor.\n\nRobbins, a Republican, was excited when Trump won the election. The president chooses two board members of his or her own party, and the Senate minority leader picks a third. Robbins assumed he'd finally be in the majority after years of serving alongside Democrats, soon able to write opinions rather than just logging dissent.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nTrump was in office a year before he nominated two board members, a pair of Republicans, including Robbins' replacement. A third nominee, a Democrat, was named three months later, in June.\n\nAssuming they'd be swiftly confirmed, Robbins quickly began preparing for their arrival, leaving customized notes with comments and suggestions for the nominees based on their distinct personalities and experience on each case.\n\nHe'd at least impart a little wisdom, he thought.\n\nBut months went by and still no vote. Robbins said he was told the Democrats were refusing to confirm the two Republicans by unanimous consent, insisting instead on a full debate for each. In late September, the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs subcommittee that screens nominees told Robbins it probably would not be able to confirm the appointees before the end of the current Congress. That meant that the entire process, which typically takes several months when there are no complications, will begin again come January, with no guarantee the nominees will be the same.\n\nNow his pile of personalized sticky notes is bound for the trash, too.\n\nTall, slim and bald, Robbins is an eternal optimist. He sees the futility of the piles of paper and empty offices. But he's determined to keep the trains running, even if he's the only one on the ride.\n\n\"It's not like I'm sitting around on the sofa watching soap operas and eating bonbons. I'm still doing my job,'' he said. \"It's only when the agency stops working that people realize what we do and the value we bring.''\n\n\"Maybe someday they'll say, `Good old Robbins, he just kept plugging along.'''\n\nFrustrating? Yes. But at least it makes for a good story at parties.\n\n\"When I say to people, `And then my votes just disappear,' the crowd usually goes `Oh, no!''' he said. \"And there's empathy, there's real empathy.''\n\nThe board, established in 1978, is responsible for protecting 2.1 million federal employees from bias and unfair treatment in the workplace. The board handles appeals from whistleblowers and other civil servants who say they were mistreated or wrongly fired, and want to challenge an initial ruling by an administrative judge. The board also conducts independent research and writes policy papers destined for the president's desk.\n\nOr it used to.\n\nRobbins is quick to point out the staffing crisis began under President Barack Obama, back when Robbins' first colleague termed out without a replacement.\n\nOthers say it's the Trump administration's fault.\n\nTrump has lagged slightly behind his predecessors in nominating political appointees. As of Nov. 19, he had nominated people for 929 positions, compared with Obama's 984 and Bush's 1,128 at the same point in their presidencies. Congress has acted on just 69 percent of those nominations, according to data provided by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization promoting government efficiency.\n\nMax Stier, the partnership's CEO, blames the administration, the Senate and a dysfunctional system of appointing and confirming political nominees.\n\n\"There are many different flavors of the same problem,'' he said. He cited several other vacancies, including assistant secretary for South Asian affairs at the State Department, deputy secretary and undersecretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, among others. \"There is so much going on, but the underlying reality is that our basic government is suffering.''\n\nJohn Palguta, former director of policy and evaluation for the merit board, called the delay \"outrageous.''\n\n\"We're setting a new standard, and it's particularly severe and unfortunate at MSPB because of the structure of the agency. It just can't operate. And to let it go for this long, that's really unconscionable,'' Palguta said. \"The administration simply hasn't done its job.''\n\nSen. James Lankford, who chairs the Senate Home Security and Government Affairs' Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management said in a statement he understands the urgency in filling these positions.\n\n\"There are over 1,500 individuals waiting for their cases to be heard, but there are not board members in place which means the backlog cannot be addressed,'' said Lankford, R-Okla.\n\nRobbins keeps plugging away and the cases keep piling up.\n\n\"We are running out of space,'' he said, shimmying between towers of boxes in a storage closet close to 6 feet tall. More boxes are stacked against the hallway wall and piled up in the clerk's office.\n\n\"Any additional cases I work from now on are just, grains of sand on a beach.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Runners Who Dislike Litter Do Plogging", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4673808.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "Many athletes have been doing it for a long time without even knowing it is now a fitness trend.

In their wake, they have left shrinking communities that struggle to support multiple businesses, schools and hospitals.\n\nThis is a common theme in the Midwestern state of Iowa, whose population has grown by less than a million people in the past century. As family farms have consolidated into megafarms run by large corporations, rural residents have moved to cities like Des Moines, the state capital, or left the state altogether.\n\n\u200bShrinking rural America\n\nThe northwest region of Iowa has been hit especially hard, forcing those who remain to drive farther and farther for things like groceries, education and health care.\n\nAt its peak, the town of Mallard hosted several grocery stores and restaurants, four churches, a cinema and two schools, one of them private. Today, its population of about 265 supports little more than a gas station and a couple of bars. The 100-year-old Catholic Church closed last summer, and the public school will close next year, forcing students to ride on buses to a neighboring town.\n\nKayla Lanning, a former horse training assistant, takes it all in her stride.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to it. It\u2019s not any big deal to us to have to travel a little ways,\u201d she said. In her case, \u201ca little ways\u201d can mean a two-hour drive.\n\nWhen Lanning learned she would be giving birth to twins, she was told that she could either schedule a cesarean section at her nearest hospital, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, or travel to a better-equipped hospital 135 kilometers (85 miles) away. She and her husband, John, chose to make the long drive and avoid the C-section.\n\nLuckily for the Lannings, the drive to the hospital was uneventful, aside from a police officer pulling them over for speeding. The babies were delivered in the hospital, but prematurely; that meant being transferred to yet another hospital, even farther away.\n\nLanning admits to being a little \u201cirritated\u201d by the distances involved, but accepts it as the part of the trade-off for staying in Mallard.\n\n\u200bFewer options\n\nBut not everyone is able to make it to a hospital with a proper obstetrics unit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to get a call from an ER (emergency room), where they say, \u2018We have a patient. She started bleeding, she\u2019s 28 weeks along, and she came in here\u2019\u201d to a hospital with no such unit, said Dr. Neil Mandsager, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies.\n\nMany hospitals don\u2019t even have an ultrasound machine to check the status of a baby, said Mandsager, the medical director of obstetrics at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines. As a result, he travels about 865 kilometers (540 miles) each month to pay weekly visits to patients in rural health care centers.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t isolated to Iowa, which ranks 36th among the 50 states in terms of population density. According to a University of Minnesota study published earlier this year, \u201c18 million reproductive-age women live in America\u2019s rural counties, but over half of these counties have no hospital\u201d where a woman can give birth.\n\nBigger gaps\n\nMandsager said Iowa \u201cdoes a pretty good job of creating a system that works as best as it can for the pregnant woman, but there\u2019s still definitely some gaps, and these gaps are getting bigger as these small hospitals close.\u201d\n\nTypically, obstetrics services in one to three maternity hospitals or obstetrics units close in Iowa each year, but this year, the number has spiked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a year when eight [obstetrics units] closed. That\u2019s a pretty high number,\u201d he said.\n\nMandsager, along with Stephanie Trusty, a nurse clinician at the Iowa Department of Public Health, attributes the closings to concerns over quality of care, malpractice insurance, profitability and low patient volume. They say it\u2019s also difficult to attract and retain physicians.\n\n\u201cIn rural Iowa, delivering babies is not scheduled. If they\u2019re a single practitioner in a rural area, then they\u2019re on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You know, that\u2019s hard,\u201d Trusty said.\n\nIn addition, there is the worry that so few deliveries can impact a physician\u2019s and nurse\u2019s ability to keep up their skills. Trusty said she looked at the maternity records of the eight hospitals that closed their obstetrics units or shut down altogether this year and found that three of them averaged less than one birth per week.\n\nNew mothers surveyed\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Health for years has used a survey given to new mothers as a way to assess concerns. The patient survey collects data on issues such as distance traveled and quality of care received. Trusty said the survey has had an extremely high response rate. Of the 40,000 yearly births in the state, the department receives about 20,000 survey responses.\n\nSurprisingly, she said, those responses haven\u2019t reinforced their fears.\n\n\u201cWe asked \u2018did they have trouble getting prenatal care,\u2019 and very few were refused care, and most people said it was still easy to get access,\u201d Trusty said. \u201cOn how many miles they drove? The data didn\u2019t change for years and years, so we took it off our survey.\u201d\n\nThat was five years ago. Because of the large number of maternity ward closings this year, Trusty said they will reintroduce the question about \u201cdistance traveled\u201d in next year\u2019s survey.\n\nAs for whether couples may be dissuaded from settling in smaller towns because of these longer commutes, Lanning said it didn\u2019t factor into her decision.\n\n\u201cWe are so grounded here. John grew up here, and everything we know and do is here. So yeah, that doesn\u2019t affect that,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "NASA's Latest Mars Probe to Attempt Landing", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-latest-mars-probe-to-attempt-landing-/4672489.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "After traveling hundreds of millions of miles through space, NASA's latest Mars probe will arrive Monday at the Red Planet.\n\nScientists have carefully chosen where they want the probe, called InSight, to land, selecting a large volcanic plain named Elysium Planitia. They say the site has few rocks and less chance of wind gusts that could potentially knock over the lander.\n\nThe spacecraft will take a crucial six minutes to enter Mars' atmosphere, descend and land. During that time, InSight will decelerate from an initial speed of 19,300 kmh (12,000 mph) down to just 8 kmh (5 mph) when it touches down. To aid the landing, scientists have equipped InSight with a parachute, descent thrusters and shock-absorbing legs.\n\nIf all goes well, InSight will make the eighth successful landing on Mars.\n\n\"My heart is beating inside of my chest like a drum,\" NASA project manager Tom Hoffman said Wednesday during a news conference about the planned landing.\n\nScientists say they are trying to determine whether the craft needs a small nudge to put it in the proper place for landing. Since InSight launched May 5, scientists have made four small tweaks to its path to ensure it arrives on target. Engineers were able to skip an additional nudge because the other maneuvers went so smoothly, and they say they might also be able to skip the final adjustment scheduled for Sunday.\n\nBy the time it lands, InSight will have traveled 484 million kilometers (300.7 million miles). However, once the lander is on the Martian surface, it cannot move, as it is not a rover. Scientists say it is critical that InSight land in the correct location, because wherever it lands is where it will stay.\n\nNASA says the landing site has been particularly quiet in recent weeks, with few storms.\n\n\u201cWe're expecting a very plain day on Mars for the landing, and we're very happy about that,\" said Rob Grover who is overseeing the landing phase.\n\nOnce landed, Insight has a unique mission to explore Mars' interior. While other missions have sought to better understand the planet's surface and atmosphere, this is the first to focus exclusively on what is under Mars' surface.\n\nThe $850 million InSight mission is planned to last about two years and will try to gather an array of information, including Mars' below-ground temperature and seismic activity, as well as to carry out an underground mapping project.\n\nInsight is armed with a crane, heat probe and seismometer and is able to hammer 5 meters (16.4 feet) below the surface.\n\nScientists are hoping the mission will help answer questions about the composition and evolution of the planet and whether Mars was formed from the same mixture of materials as Earth.\n\nOnce InSight touches down, it will wait for 16 minutes to allow the dust that it kicked up to settle down again. Then it will deploy solar arrays, a critical step that will allow the lander to power itself for the next two years. InSight also has a battery system, but that will only last one day.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on Mars about 3 p.m. EST (2000 UTC) on Monday. Scientists hope to know quickly whether the landing was successful but say if communication with the spacecraft is delayed, they might not know InSight's status for several hours or even days.\n\nNASA's website will be broadcasting news of InSight's approach and landing all day Monday."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Ranchers Combat Overgrazing to Protect Climate", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ranchers-combat-overgrazing-to-fight-climate-change/4670713.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Meredith Ellis gets a bit rapturous about the little patch of earth under her feet.\n\nWhen she bought this northern Texas land several years ago, it was overgrazed and overrun with weeds. Now, she\u2019s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb. She picks a tiny patch of the green moss from between clumps of tall brown grass gone dormant with the fall chill.\n\n\u201cLook at all these little bits of biodiversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a little fantasy world going on in there.\u201d\n\nBringing it back has been a labor of love \u2014 love of the G Bar C Ranch where she grew up, and for the 4-year-old son she\u2019s raising here.\n\n\u201cEverything I do, I think about him now,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about his future, and what is this world going to look like when he\u2019s my age?\u201d\n\nEllis worries about the droughts, floods and other calamities he may face from climate change. She wonders if there even will be enough food to go around.\n\nIt\u2019s a big reason why she raises her cattle a bit differently than most.\n\nThe differences not only help to combat climate change. They also provide more clean water. They can even save ranchers money. And if one project goes forward, farmers may get financial rewards for making the changes.\n\nMeadows vs. lawns\n\nEllis\u2019s fields look like meadows. Her cattle forage among an assortment of thigh-high native grasses.\n\nOther ranches nearby look like giant lawns. Cows have grazed the grass monocultures nearly down to the ground.\n\nThe difference matters, says rangeland scientist Jeff Goodwin with the Noble Research Institute, because the native grass is \u201cnot only feeding this cow herd. It\u2019s also feeding the underground herd: the microbes, the biology in the soil. That\u2019s what really makes that soil an active, living, breathing system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a system with the potential to remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe more forage production that we\u2019re getting, the deeper the root systems, the more carbon we\u2019re sequestering out of the atmosphere,\u201d Goodwin added.\n\nThat\u2019s increasingly important. Scientists warn that the world needs to do more than just stop producing greenhouse gases in order to avoid the worst of climate change. Carbon dioxide needs to be actively removed from the atmosphere in order to keep the planet from potentially catastrophic warming.\n\nWhile engineers puzzle over high-tech solutions, a recent report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says nature offers tools that are ready to go today.\n\nValuable ecosystem services\n\nGrasslands and the soils beneath them act as giant carbon sinks, the report notes.\n\nBut not if they are overgrazed.\n\nAround the world, one estimate says, about 200 million hectares are overgrazed, an area roughly the size of Mexico.\n\nOne study estimates that optimizing grazing could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 89 million metric tons, roughly the same as permanently parking 19 million cars.\n\nPlus, overgrazed land erodes more easily. That\u2019s a double whammy. Ranchers lose fertile soil, and it ends up muddying drinking water downstream, which increases the cost to make it tap-ready.\n\nOn the other hand, healthy grassland soils that store carbon also store and filter water.\n\nThose benefits should be worth money, Goodwin said. They\u2019re known as ecosystem services, and the Noble Research Institute is working to develop a marketplace for them. Ranchers would earn credits based on their soil\u2019s carbon content and its water storage and filtration capacity.\n\nSome major food and beverage companies are interested in the market. Many have set goals to improve sustainability up and down their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really a solid path forward\u201d for many of them to meet those goals, Goodwin said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re sitting in a very good position to be able to provide that opportunity.\u201d\n\nAll profits from the soil\n\nMany of the steps ranchers could take to earn ecosystem service credits would help their bottom lines anyway.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to talk about soil health building as a thing to do for the environment. But really, it\u2019s something we need to be doing for our profitability as well,\u201d said Michael Vance, managing partner at Stark Ranch, a short drive from Ellis\u2019 operation.\n\n\u201cAll your profit comes from the soil,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stood in a field where cattle had recently been grazing, but you\u2019d never know it. The grass still stood tall. His neighbors don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t let the cows graze it all the way down. They think he\u2019s wasting it.\n\n\u201cWe get phone calls where people want to drive a bailer in here and bail up this grass, but they don\u2019t realize the positives that come by leaving it standing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe field grows more grass when cattle are moved off it sooner. That means Vance buys less feed.\n\nEven if it\u2019s more profitable, it\u2019s not easy for people to change their ways, and ranchers are a conservative bunch.\n\n\u201cYou realize things that you were raised doing, things that your dad and your granddad did, maybe weren\u2019t the best things to do,\u201d Vance said, \u201cfrom an environmental perspective, maybe from even a profitability perspective.\u201d\n\nFinancial incentives might help other ranchers make changes, he adds.\n\nThe Noble Research Institute plans to launch a pilot ecosystem services market in 2019 and is aiming for a full rollout in 2022."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Developed in Australia Shows Promise", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis-developed-in-australia/4672104.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis using immunotherapy.

Insurers, for example, can use the telemetry to identify local vegetation, wind patterns and fire history. In some cases, it can determine that the owner of one home is more likely to suffer damage than the owner of a neighboring home, he said.\n\n\"Does it seem intrusive? It can be,\" he said. \"They have a lot more information on all of us, on our properties than they had two, five, 10 years ago. That's a major issue and that's something regulators are going to have to talk about.\"\n\nDuring the wildfires, Travelers said the information has been used to expedite claims, even in areas that are still inaccessible to inspectors.\n\nWorkers were able to see what roads were open and map out spots in Chico and Thousand Oaks to park the RVs that serve as mobile claim centers, the company said. The tools also indicated where customers who evacuated were going to be, Wucherpfennig said.\n\nThe glassed-in Travelers National Catastrophe Center is located in Windsor, Connecticut. Modeled after military war rooms, it includes a conference table behind 19 high-definition screens, which display maps, graphs, television images and social media sites, all providing real-time data on the fires.\n\nIn some cases, even before adjusters arrive on scene, claims experts can assess damage from the fires and cut checks by using before-and-after images taken by drones, aircraft or satellites as well as videos or photos uploaded by customers from their phones. Employees have tools and smart phone apps that can convert those photos into instant measurements, to help quantify the damage.\n\n\"We're able to virtually interact with customers much more easily than we could even in the recent past,\" Wucherpfennig said. \"We're also able to monitor all forms of social media in real time. That helps us create an event footprint, which helps us understand how the event is tracking and what type of damages we're seeing.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Solar-powered Suitcases Bring Light to Darkened Classrooms", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/solar-powered-suitcases-bring-light-to-darkened-classrooms/4669044.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nSolar-powered suitcases are bringing light to darkened classrooms and struggling students in rural Kenya.

We are seeing this unfold right now in the Ebola epidemic raging in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2015 an epidemic that has been declared the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nTrust is the most important part of the doctor-patient relationship. I know that if I lose my patients\u2019 trust, it will be impossible for me to effectively treat them. In order to establish a trusting relationship, I must understand my patients as more than just their diseases\u2014I must understand them within the complex fabric of their social, political, religious and cultural belief systems.\n\nI do this while they are healthy, so when illness does strike they can trust me to make the right decision for them. International responders\u2019 failure to locate the DRC\u2019s current Ebola epidemic within the country\u2019s larger social, political, religious and cultural belief systems is precisely why trust was so weak when they arrived weeks ago to deploy vaccines and begin tracking the infection.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen this happen before. During the West African Ebola epidemic of 2014, a lack of community trust helped allow the virus to evolve into a pandemic, killing more than 11,000 people over two years and spreading overseas. Many international public health experts were blindsided by local community members\u2019 hesitancy and fear. West Africans went so far as to hide their funeral services from international Ebola treatment teams; funerals are now thought to be one of the most important modes of transmission between dead victims and family members later infected.\n\nMany West Africans turned to the familiar \u2014 traditional healers \u2014 rather than seeking modern medical treatment. Ultimately, anthropologists were deployed to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural nuances that needed stronger appreciation before the right interventions could be designed for specific communities. From this research, we learned that trust is the vehicle by which epidemic responses are executed effectively.\n\nYet that same lesson is catching us off-guard once again. In the North Kivu, an already awful situation is worsening, fueled by mistrust and conspiracy fears. Civilians are questioning if Ebola is possibly a political tool being used by opposition parties to alter upcoming elections. As a result, they are avoiding not just vaccinations but also testing and treatment. This means efforts at keeping track of who is infected \u2015 and vaccinating those who have come into contact with an infected individual \u2015 are failing. And the mistrust is not only directed at international responders \u2014 many locals don\u2019t trust the DRC government, either.\n\nWorse yet is that we knew this was coming. Conspiracies like these also plagued the last Ebola epidemic. In Liberia, civilians questioned if Ebola was a Western ploy to infect Africans; others wondered if Ebola was artificially created to sell vaccines to the poor.\n\nIf I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant.\n\nWhen I put myself in the mind of the patient, I am not surprised by any of this. If I was approached by a doctor with whom I didn\u2019t already have a therapeutic relationship and was told to take a pill or a shot, I\u2019d be understandably hesitant. Trust must be established before \u2014 not after \u2014 a disease infects an individual or ravages a country.\n\nIf public health efforts emphasized the building of ground-level trust when communities are predominately healthy (the same way I establish rapport with my patients over many years), we\u2019d see responders and community members working together when an epidemic strikes. This would prevent a few cases from becoming hundreds or thousands.\n\nEpidemics require quick action, but we cannot cut corners when it comes to understanding a community\u2019s knowledge, attitudes and practices before employing interventions. What does the community understand about Ebola? What types of experiences are driving their belief systems? How can we best work within those systems to identify misunderstandings at their roots?\n\nFrom there, how can we work with community leaders to best teach people in a way that is culturally appropriate and locally understood? That same thoughtful approach must be taken when it comes to vaccines, diagnostics and treatment.\n\nTake vaccines, for example. U.S. physicians are very familiar with vaccine hesitancy. Almost every day, at least a handful of my patients refuse to get the flu vaccine. They often recount personal experiences in which they received the vaccine and still got sick that year. Some mistakenly believe the vaccine actually caused their flu.\n\nThis means I must take the time to explain that not every upper respiratory infection is the flu, and that the flu vaccine may very well have lessened symptoms that would have otherwise been much worse. Even then, my patients don\u2019t always agree, but we continue to have a rapport that allows me to treat them for other conditions.\n\nThe same is likely to happen with Ebola. Some patients may be amenable to vaccination, some to treatment, some to testing and some to none of these. Nonetheless, public health responders must use every opportunity to build rapport, establish trust and prove to communities that they are there in the best interests of the community\u2019s health.\n\nBuilding trust with my patients has allowed me to convince people to undergo treatments that ultimately saved their lives.

In his opinion, Friedman wrote that \u201cas despicable as this practice may be,\u201d FGM is a crime that should fall under the jurisdiction of states \u2015 not the federal government. He found that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a federal law criminalizing FGM in 1996.\n\nBut some activists are worried about the message that the ruling will send to members of Nagarwala\u2019s religious community, Dawoodi Bohras, for whom genital cutting is still a deeply engrained tradition.\n\nMariya Tehrer is the co-founder of Sahiyo, a group that seeks to end FGM in the Bohra community. Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years. At the same time, since Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, some Dawoodi Bohra women have banded together to publicly defend the practice as harmless, and claim that governmental attempts to restrict it infringes on their religious freedom. Tahrer said she\u2019s noticed a movement to dismiss survivors\u2019 stories as attention-seeking attempts to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the community. And the sect\u2019s religious leaders in Mumbai still largely support khatna, Tahrer said, which makes it harder for local imams in India and the diaspora to publicly speak against it.\n\nStill, Tahrer believes the discussions the Nagarwala case have prompted within the Bohra community are a positive development."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Admits To Targeting Billionaire George Soros In PR Attack", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-target-george-soros-billionaire_us_5bf5d6f2e4b0771fb6b5b1ec", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook officials on Wednesday admitted to digging up dirt on Jewish billionaire George Soros and its competitors less than a week after The New York Times published an explosive expos\u00e9 on the tech giant.\n\nElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s head of communication and policy, published a blog post detailing the company\u2019s decision to hire Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, and why it aimed its effort at the company\u2019s critics, including Soros.\n\n\u201cSome of this work is being characterized as opposition research,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cBut I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied having any knowledge of the company\u2019s PR campaign against Soros until the Times investigation, which also found negative campaigns aimed at Apple and Google, was made public.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, also denied having knowledge of the hiring of Definers.

Instead It Unleashed a Catastrophe.", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "A few days later, we drove north, 20 hours on punishing mountain roads, toward the Malaysian border and the West Kalimantan district of Sintang. There, a meeting was planned with the local county governor, or bupati, to discuss a similar situation.\n\nNorth of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors.\n\nThe permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It\u2019s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. \u201cWe call them shadow companies,\u201d said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations.\n\nThe connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.)\n\nAt the bupati\u2019s house, an elegant, 19th-century Dutch-built compound bursting with tropical flowers, I pressed him to explain how these peatland forests could be cut down when the government insisted that such land clearing had stopped. The bupati, a doctor named Jarot, had moved to Borneo from Java and had developed a local reputation as a conservationist. He greeted us jovially, barefoot and dressed in bluejeans and a crisp, untucked blue button-down shirt. He said the rural districts must balance economic growth with sustainability, and while he has pledged to control corruption and illegal permits, he also described himself as helpless against the currents of a central government that is close to the big corporations and constantly changes both the rules and the playing field. United Nations forest programs pay communities to leave their trees in the ground. Such funding would help him strike a better balance here, he said, casually shrugging off the plantation case I asked about. \u201cWe do what we can do,\u201d Jarot said. \u201cWe cannot do it by ourselves. ... We need a fiscal incentive.\u201d\n\nAn aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases \u201cpeatland\u201d and \u201cforest\u201d have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as \u201cforest\u201d under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines \u2014 lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies\u2019 land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis?\n\n7. \u2018It Was a Mistake\u2019\n\nThis September, with late-season heat pounding Washington, Zenzi Suhadi cleared security at the Russell Senate Office Building, preparing to brief Senate aides about the impact that palm-oil development was having on Indonesia\u2019s environment. I asked if he was nervous, and he said no. \u201cThese are just people. I don\u2019t have to face any tigers.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to be joking."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Migrants in Tijuana Run to U.S. Border, but Fall Back in Face of Tear Gas", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/tijuana-mexico-border.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-26 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "TIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 A peaceful march by Central American migrants waiting at the southwestern United States border veered out of control on Sunday afternoon, as hundreds of people tried to evade a Mexican police blockade and run toward a giant border crossing that leads into San Diego.\n\nIn response, the United States Customs and Border Protection agency shut down the border crossing in both directions and fired tear gas to push back migrants from the border fence.
