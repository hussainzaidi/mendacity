Those included tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-presidential candidate. Trump has denied those claims.\n\nContact with Russians\n\nCohen was subsequently charged last week by the special counsel's office with one count of lying to Congress about the Moscow project. He pleaded guilty, disclosing that talks about the effort in Moscow had extended through June 2016, after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and that both Trump and his family members had been briefed on the discussions. Cohen also acknowledged pursuing plans to send Trump and himself to Russia in service of the project and discussing the proposed development directly with a representative of the Kremlin.\n\nThe special counsel's Friday memo on the matter suggested that Cohen's -- and, by extension, Trump's -- intersection with Russians eager to aid the presidential campaign was more substantial than previously known, with the Russians anxious to put Trump face-to-face with their president.\n\nIn one instance, Cohen spoke in November 2015 to a Russian national who offered \"synergy on a government level\" to the Trump presidential campaign and \"repeatedly proposed\" a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to court papers.\n\nThe interest appears to have been reciprocal. Cohen told the special counsel that he had consulted with Trump about his interest in contacting the Russian government before suggesting in a radio interview in September 2015 that Trump meet with Putin during the Russian President's visit to New York City that fall.\n\nCohen had previously claimed his comments on air were spontaneous, the court papers said, but he admitted to prosecutors that they came about after his discussion with Trump.\n\nThat meeting never happened, nor did the one with the Russian national, although Cohen told the special counsel that was due to the fact that he was working on the Moscow project \"with a different individual who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.\"\n\nMueller's sentencing memo also provided the first explanation of the Trump Tower Moscow project's relevance to Russia's interference during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAccording to the special counsel, Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThat Cohen continued to work on the Trump Tower Moscow project -- and discuss it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, prosecutors said, noting in particular that \"it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nA tightening net\n\nThe filings on Cohen, and a submission from Mueller about Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, appear to further tighten the net that Mueller is gathering around the President and his inner circle.\n\nThey come at a time when Trump appears to be increasingly worried and furious about the investigation, following a searing tweet storm aimed at the special counsel on Friday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed the significance of prosecutors' findings, saying late Friday that \"the government's filings in Mr. Cohen's case tell us nothing of value that wasn't already known. Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\"\n\nThe memos also appear to take aim at several issues that have and could continue to ensnare others in the President's orbit, including the act of lying not just to federal agents but also to the public and the media. Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project, they said, constituted an attempt to alter the course of the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses,\" prosecutors wrote. \"By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nProsecutors unhappy with Cohen's cooperation\n\nDespite Cohen's disclosures to the special counsel, however, Manhattan federal prosecutors sought repeatedly to emphasize the limited nature of his assistance in other investigations.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors have continued to investigate the Trump Organization based on information in the charges against Cohen, CNN has reported, and Cohen met with prosecutors to discuss \"the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes,\" they said in their filing. But, they noted, he \"declined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest.\"\n\nProsecutors also said the information Cohen has provided to the New York State Attorney General's Office, which has a civil lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation, \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\nAnd while Cohen has met with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which has also been examining the Trump Organization, CNN has reported, his assistance \"appears to consist solely of providing that entity information that they would otherwise have obtained via subpoena.\"\n\nThe Cohen cases are being considered together for sentencing purposes. In the New York federal prosecutors' case, the sentencing guidelines call for a term of 51 to 63 months in prison, and prosecutors on Friday asked the court to \"impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable guidelines range.\"\n\nUS District Judge William Pauley III can deviate from the guidelines when he determines Cohen's sentence.\n\nCohen's attorneys have asked the court to give him no prison time, but prosecutors on Friday voiced their objection to that proposal, noting that the crimes Cohen committed had far-reaching consequences that extended all the way to the White House.\n\n\"While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\" they wrote.\n\n\"He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1,\" they said. \"In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Burnett: Mueller drops a major bomb on Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Z86QnKTwCnI/trump-mueller-filings-michael-cohen-erin-burnett-sot-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

They reveal that a Russian national who claimed connections to the Russian government spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn addition, the documents also detail how Manafort was directly in touch with a senior Trump administration earlier this year as well as his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national who Mueller's team says has ties to Russian intelligence services, though the details of those interactions are redacted.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed Cohen\n\nFor the first time, federal prosecutors say that Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations connected to the payments, Cohen stated in court that he had been directed by Trump.\n\nBut the sentencing memo from the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which was filed separately from Mueller's team, was the first time the government has stated Trump's role in the payments. Trump has denied the affairs, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to the payments.\n\n\"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\" prosecutors wrote in a reference to Trump.\n\nLying liars\n\nMueller's team documents a number of lies told by Cohen and Manafort -- and has the proof to back it up.\n\nManafort's legal team has disputed that he lied to the special counsel since entering into a cooperation agreement -- which would violate that agreement -- but Mueller has texts. The court filing cites a text exchange in which Manafort authorized an associate to speak to a Trump administration official on his behalf.\n\nIn all, Mueller accuses Manafort of lying on five separate matters.\n\nCohen's lies, some of which he admitted to in a guilty plea last week, included lying to the special counsel investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project after offering to cooperate. Mueller's team says he eventually took responsibility for his lies, later explaining he was trying not to contradict his congressional testimony.\n\nThere are now three officials in Trump's orbit accused of lying to the special counsel: Manafort, Cohen and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates who pleaded guilty to lying during one of his early meetings with Mueller's team.\n\nTrump Tower Moscow is relevant to meddling\n\nMueller's memo lays out how the Trump Tower Moscow project is relevant to Russia's election meddling during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe fact that Cohen continued to work on the proposal through June 2016, not ending in January as he falsely testified -- and he discussed it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, the special counsel said.\n\nMueller said that the continued work on Trump Tower Moscow \"occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nThe special counsel memo states that Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThe argument in Cohen's filing underscores that the overlap of business and politics is relevant to the special counsel's inquiry.\n\nFalse public statements also key to investigation\n\nThe special counsel's office made clear that it sees not just lies to investigators but also false public statements as significant in the Cohen sentencing memo.\n\nProsecutors explained that Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project continuing through June 2016 were an effort to alter the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses. By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, the special counsel stressed that Michael Flynn's false statement also impacted what others said publicly.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between [Flynn] and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nInterestingly, Mueller redacts the rest of the paragraph. So if the impact was explained, it is still a secret.\n\nThe emphasis on public statements could offer clues at how prosecutors view the relevance of efforts to misdirect in formulating the first public statement about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting aboard Air Force One the next year.\n\nOne of the questions that Mueller wanted to ask Trump, as seen in the questions that were given to the President's lawyers earlier this year, focused just on that: \"What involvement did you have in the communication strategy, including the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s emails?\"\n\nWhy did Manafort try to hide contacts with administration officials?\n\nOne of the mysteries in the Manafort court filing: Who was he allegedly contacting in the Trump administration during 2018 -- and why?\n\nMueller accuses Manafort of lying about multiple contacts with Trump administration officials, including a senior administration official. Mueller cites a May 2018 text exchange authorizing an associate to contact one official, and a Manafort colleague describing a February 2018 contact with the senior official.\n\nIt's not clear why Manafort was conducting the outreach -- but Mueller's team signals in the filing that it likely has the answer.\n\n\"A review of documents recovered from a search of Manafort's electronic documents demonstrations additional contacts with Administration officials,\" the filing states.\n\nWhy Mueller still thinks Cohen's credible\n\nWhile the special counsel's office does not make a recommendation to give Cohen reduced prison time, Mueller still says that Cohen was a cooperative witness.\n\nAnd Mueller's team makes a reference to Cohen's credibility, which is poised to be a key question if any of the information Cohen provides is used in other cases the special counsel is pursuing -- especially given that Mueller documents how Cohen even lied to the special counsel.\n\nIn the court filing, Mueller's team notes that the information that Cohen provided \"has been credible and consistent with other evidence obtained\" in the special counsel's ongoing investigation, which signals the special counsel investigators independently corroborated what Cohen told them.\n\nMueller outlined four areas where Mueller cooperated, which include his own contacts with \"Russian interests\" during the 2016 campaign, \"useful information\" concerning Russia-related matters, contacts with people connected to the Trump White House and \"the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries.\"\n\nCohen was less useful to Manhattan US Attorney's office, which said that the information Cohen provided to the New York Attorney General's office in their ongoing case against the Trump Foundation \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\n\"After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen's decision to plead guilty -- rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes -- does not make him a hero,\" prosecutors wrote."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Kellyanne Conway's husband trolls Trump's tweet", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Mo5ugTJcUrM/donald-trump-george-conway-tweet-sot-vpx-ebof.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

None of the material in this series may be reproduced without an explicit credit to CNN and the Pulitzer Center.\n\nTokyo (CNN) One of the first concepts Linh Nguyen learned while studying Japanese was \"uchi-soto.\"\n\nIt refers to the practice of categorizing people into one of two groups -- insiders or outsiders. Family, friends and close acquaintances are insiders, referred to as \"uchi,\" while \"soto\" is for those relegated to the periphery.\n\nThe second type, which would have no renewal limit, is aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. Both visas require proficiency in Japanese.\n\nThe first, renewable for up to 5 years, would cover semi-qualified, blue-collar workers, and is aimed at plugging gaps in areas such as care-giving and manufacturing.\n\nA proposed amendment to the immigration law, if passed, will create two new visas for foreign workers.\n\nFor this Japan-obsessed student in Vietnam, it felt like a warning: she could be about to enter a deeply closed society that would always consider her an outsider.\n\nUltimately, though, that was not Nguyen's experience. The 25-year-old discovered that Japan was slowly changing.\n\nAs Japan's population gets older and smaller, the government is struggling to balance its own deeply conservative views on immigration with the need for new and younger workers. Public opinion is on the side of change. Despite perceptions of xenophobia, a 2018 Pew survey revealed that 59% of Japanese believed immigrants would actually make the country stronger.\n\nThis week, Japanese lawmakers approved a policy change proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that will create new visa categories to allow an estimated 340,000 foreign workers to take both high-skilled and low-wage jobs in Japan over the next five years.\n\nWhile this represents a major shift in Japan's approach to immigration, many experts argue it doesn't go far enough.\n\nVietnamese student Linh Nyugen came to Japan to pursue higher education.\n\nShrinking nation\n\nJapan is already a \"super-aged\" nation -- meaning that more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017, a record low since official records began in 1899, while an increase in deaths accelerated the population decline.\n\nThe decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of healthcare and pensions.\n\nBut Japan isn't the only country with such a problem.\n\nSingapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries. Germany is a also a \"super-aged\" nation. And by 2030 , the US, UK,Singapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries.\n\nIf Abe is to prevent Japan's population from dipping below 100 million by 2060 , he will need to provide migrants good reasons to choose the country, says Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nA 2015 Pew survey exploring how people in Asia-Pacific see each other revealed that a median of 71% of people in the region held a favorable view of Japan, with positive views exceeding negative sentiment by more than five-to-one.\n\nNguyen points to Japan's solid environmental practices and strong safety record as appealing factors.\n\nBut the country's historic failure to integrate previous waves of foreign workers raises questions as to why migrants would choose to come to Japan.\n\nFaced with labor shortages in the 1990s Japan revised its immigration rules to offer long-term, renewable visas to the descendants of Japanese immigrants who had moved to Latin American after World War II.\n\nBut when the economy slumped in 2008, the government urged those same immigrants to return to Brazil and the other Latin American nations where they had moved from.\n\n\"Japan treats its foreign workers like Kleenex,\" says Jeff Kingston, a Japanese studies professor at Temple University. \"They have a use-it, toss-it mentality.\"\n\nOther options nearby\n\nSingapore has a very different track record. Since independence in 1965, the small South-east Asian city state has built a diverse society by taking in large numbers of immigrants from neighboring Asian countries.\n\nToday, foreigners make up more than one-third of Singapore's labor force , though conditions are challenging for low-skilled laborers and numerous abuses exist.\n\nOn its website , the Singapore government states that non-resident foreigners do jobs Singaporeans don't want, and do not compete with locals for high-paying professional or managerial jobs. \"They are here to help build our homes, keep our roads clean, and make our lives just a little more comfortable,\" the website says.\n\nThe new visa will allow blue collar workers to stay in Japan for up to five years.\n\nExperts argue that Japan lags behind other industrialized countries in extolling the benefits of immigration to its domestic population. \"The government needs to sell how these people contribute to pensions and economic growth,\" Kingston says.\n\nAs immigration policy has failed to keep up with demand, temporary fixes have plugged the gap. Foreigners on student visas, for example, can work up to 28 hours per week -- but Japan has been accused of using students to fill labor shortages.\n\nis one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached Nguyen, who is studying for a masters degree,is one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached a record high of 2.5 million , although that's still only 2% of Japan's total population.\n\nOn a bustling Tokyo side street is the office of Inbound Japan, a concierge service and cultural interpreter for foreign students struggling to navigate living and working in Japan.\n\nYusuke Furumi at work in the Inbound Japan office with his Vietnamese colleague, Angel Phan.\n\nFive years ago, Inbound Japan started providing foreign students with cheap dorm rooms. Its range of services grew as people wanted help getting phone contracts, setting up bank accounts, going to hospital and finding part-time jobs.\n\nYusuke Furumi, an employee there, hopes Japan can gradually become more open to the idea of working alongside foreigners, and make it easier for them to stay and contribute to the economy and society.\n\nEnter the outback\n\nIn the small town of Muroto, in southeastern Japan, foreigners on the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) have come to the rescue.\n\nOnce a booming fishing port, today Muroto has a graying community. Vacant houses pockmark the area where the town's bars once thrived. Many of the town's public facilities such as hospitals and elementary schools have shut down.\n\nSo when Mie Kinoshita was unable to find a mechanic to work in her car dealership in 2017, she decided to outsource her needs -- and applied to receive technical interns from the Philippines.\n\nJohn Riggs Ancino is shadowing Masahiro Maeda.\n\nThe scheme has faced frequent criticism since its establishment in 1993. In theory, the TITP allows low-skilled workers to come to Japan to learn technical skills they can later take back to their home countries. But opponents of the program allege it has been used as a loophole to plug gaps in the domestic labor market. Trainees, meanwhile, have reported frequent instances of workplace abuse and bullying.\n\nKinoshita was aware of the horror stories. To help create a more welcoming environment, she bought a house for her staff. And while they presently only make minimum wage, which is 762 yen ($6.70) an hour in Muroto, she hopes to increase their wages as their skills grow.\n\nKinoshita's employees John Riggs Ancino and Marvin Curilan, arrived in Muroto from the Philippines two months ago. On arrival in Japan, the pair received several weeks of Japanese language and culture lessons.\n\n\"I'd like to stay here,\" says Riggs Ancino, who worked in a tire repair shop back home. \"It would be great if I could build a family in Japan.\"\n\nTheir Japanese colleagues also appreciate the newcomers.\n\n\"It's still hard for us to understand one another, but I've been working on my English skills,\" says Masahiro Maeda, a mechanic in his late 50s. \"I'd like them to stay.\"\n\nMasoto Yasuda, a mechanic in his late 30s, adds: \"I want to go to the Philippines now. It hadn't really crossed my mind before I met them.\"\n\nBoth local and foreign workers at the car dealership said they hoped the immigrants could stay in Japan.\n\nUnder the current rules, technical trainees can only work in Japan for five years.\n\nAbe's proposals, however, would allow them to apply for an additional five years. But there's a catch. To do so they would have to apply from their home countries, denying them the right to seek permanent residency -- which requires 10 years of continuous living in Japan.\n\nExperts fear terms like this may run through many of Abe's new proposals, helping more blue collars workers come to Japan -- but preventing them from settling long term.\n\nJapan's work culture\n\nWhile Japan might be coming around to the appeal of foreigner workers, not all of the newcomers are keen on Japanese work culture.\n\nSamir Levi came to Japan from Nepal four years ago, after his older brother did a six-week cultural exchange in Tokyo. Levi, 26, worked a part-time job as a dishwasher in a ramen shop and the graveyard shift at a convenience store, before becoming a recruiter for a Japanese language school in the capital.\n\nHe has absorbed the Japanese habits of gently bobbing the head in agreement and executing a well-timed farewell bow. \"I blend in here now,\" he says. \"I've become Japanese in some ways.\"\n\nLevi meets up with friends in Shin-Okubo, an area of Tokyo split along gastronomical lines.\n\nBut the longer Levi lives in Japan, the less he wants to stay. Now a salary man, Levi clocks long hours -- just like locals. Earlier this year, the government limited overtime to 100 hours per month, but Levi yearns for better options.\n\nNow he wants to move to the US or Australia.\n\nNguyen, too, has integrated into Japan and has a mix of local and migrant friends. But she is wary of committing to Japan's long working hours and culture of heavy out-of-office drinking with colleagues, known as \"nomikai.\"\n\nShe would stay in Japan, she says, if she could bring her parents to live with her. Failing that, she might move to Australia or Canada or go back to Vietnam.\n\n\"I haven't lost my fascination with Japan yet,\" Nyugen says. \"But perhaps Japan may need to realize that it needs foreigners as opposed to the other way around.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Eiffel Tower, Louvre to close amid fears of weekend protests", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/RQEgOeEuQPc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) France is bracing for another weekend of protests that could rock Paris and other parts of the country.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government was deploying 89,000 security force members across France -- including 8,000 in the capital -- in case the demonstrations turn violent again.\n\nMany of Paris' famed sites -- including the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Mus\u00e9e Delacroix and the Paris Opera -- will close over the weekend in advance of the protests, organized by the \"gilets jaunes,\" or \"yellow vest\" movement.

MUST WATCH Moisi: France was supposed to be carrier of hope 10:04\n\nThe demonstrations began as a form of grassroots opposition to rising gas prices and planned increases in taxes on polluting forms of transport, but they have evolved into broader protests against President Emmanuel Macron's government.\n\nMacron appeared to back down Wednesday, announcing that the fuel tax planned for January -- as part of measures to combat climate change -- would not be introduced in 2019. But the movement now appears to be about more than just taxes; it's exposed the growing divide between Paris' metropolitan elite and the country's rural poor.\n\nMaxime Nicolle, a member of the gilets jaunes from rural Brittany, told CNN: \"I'm definitely not backing down now. The moratorium is useless. The people want a referendum, a referendum on Macron, the Senate and the National Assembly.\"\n\nStreet furniture, such as railings around trees, public bicycle stations and benches, will be removed from parts of Paris ahead of the expected protests so they can't be used as weapons, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said.\n\nMunicipal buildings will be closed, and services \"mobilized and determined to ensure everyone's protection,\" she said. In an appeal to protesters, the mayor added, \"Please take care of Paris, because Paris belongs to all the French people.\"\n\nHigh school students demonstrate Friday at the Place de la Republique in Paris over education reforms.\n\nOn Friday, Benoit Potterie, a member of Parliament from Macron's En Marche party, wrote on Twitter that he received a bullet by mail and said that a note accompanying it contained the message, \"Next time, it will be between your eyes.\"\n\nIn response to the threat, the lawmaker tweeted: \"I have always been open to dialogue but these threats are unacceptable. I will not be intimidated and continue my work as a Member of Parliament with the same motivation, the general interest and the same method: exchange and dialogue.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear who sent the bullet.\n\nUnrest spreads to schools\n\nMany of those demonstrating have moved to the suburbs due to rising real estate prices. Suburban protesters, like those from rural areas, argue they're disproportionately affected by the now-shelved gas tax, as they rely on gas and cars much more than city dwellers.\n\nCastener, the interior minister, said he had talked to protesters and had some sympathy with their concerns and economic troubles.\n\nBut, he said, the French government had made appropriate gestures. \"The Prime Minister opened the door, and canceled the environment tax,\" he said.\n\nHigh schoolers set a barricade on fire to block a tramway during a protest Wednesday in Bordeaux.\n\nThe unrest has spread to hundreds of high schools across the country, where students are demonstrating against recent education reforms.\n\nMore than 140 people were arrested Thursday outside a school in the Paris suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie after protesters clashed with police.\n\nEducation Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told radio station France Inter on Friday that he, like many others, had been shocked by images of students in Mantes-la-Jolie being made to kneel with their hands behind their heads by security forces. But he said that elements from outside the schools had used the situation to stir up trouble and attack security forces.\n\nPolice detain students Thursday in Mantes-la-Jolie after clashes with security forces.\n\nCastaner said 12 officers were present to bring the situation under control, which was reflected in the methods they used.\n\nMeanwhile, La Voix du Nord newspaper in northern France reported that a bottle containing acid had been thrown Friday at one of its journalists and a fellow reporter while they were covering a high school protest in the town of Wingles, in the Pas-de-Calais department. The two narrowly managed to avoid being hit, the paper said.\n\nPresidency in crisis\n\nIt's unclear if the gilets jaunes demonstrations will be as violent or as large this weekend. The number of protesters peaked last month at 282,000, according to the Interior Ministry, but has been slowly on the decline, with 136,000 taking part Sunday.\n\nSince the first protests were held in mid-November, 1,648 people have been injured, including 552 police officers, the Interior Ministry said. More than 1,600 people have been taken in for questioning and 1,387 arrested.\n\nMacron will not speak publicly before this weekend's protests, the press office for the presidency said Friday. Macron is resisting pressure from protesters and politicians to speak sooner to calm tensions ahead of time.\n\nDominique Moisi, a foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne and a former Macron campaign adviser, told CNN the French presidency was not only in crisis but that Europe's future also hung in the balance.\n\n\"In a few months from now, there will be European elections, and France was supposed to be the carrier of hope and European progress. What happens if it's no longer? If the President is incapacitated to carry that message?\" Moisi asked.\n\n\"It's about the future of democracy, as well; illiberal democracies are rising all over the world. And if Macron fails, the future of France risks looking like the presidency of Italy today. And it's much more serious because we have a centralized state, which plays a major role in the balance of power within Europe.\n\n\"But make no mistake, it is a French version of a much more global phenomenon.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Kevin Hart pulls out as Oscars host after homophobic tweets", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/Wd9DfJoE6CY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Kevin Hart is stepping down from hosting the Oscars after homophobic tweets surfaced on Thursday.\n\nThe tweets, between 2009 and 2011, included derogatory language referring to gay people and made disparaging comments about sexuality.\n\nKevin Hart\n\nIn one of the tweets from 2011, among some that have been deleted, the comedian-actor said, \"Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice 'stop that's gay'.\"\n\n\"I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year's Oscar's,\" Hart, who is currently performing in Sydney, Australia, announced late Sunday on Twitter. \"This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists.

Kenneth Bernard Pius Hendricks, 77, originally from Cincinnati, was arrested Wednesday in the Philippine city of Naval after several alleged victims came forward to Philippine and US investigators last month, authorities said.\n\nThough court documents filed in late November cite five accusers, a total of 10 accusers have now come forward in the Philippines, alleging Hendricks sexually abused them when they were boys, US Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Steve Francis said Thursday in Cincinnati.\n\nBecause Hendricks also spends parts of the year in the United States, investigators are asking the public in both countries for information about the priest.\n\n\"It's horrifying ... abusive conduct,\" US attorney Benjamin Glassman said Thursday about the allegations in the Philippines. \"It's grooming children -- young children -- that are interested in being involved in church activities and taking those kids and sexually abusing them.\"\n\n\"He befriended them, he would invite them to his residence\" before engaging in progressively intimate contact, sometimes including oral and anal sex, Glassman said.\n\nUS law criminalizes certain illegal sexual conduct by American citizens abroad. Hendricks is charged in federal court in Cincinnati on a count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places , punishable by fines and/or up to 30 years in prison.\n\nHendricks was being held in a Philippines Bureau of Immigrations holding facility in Manila, the bureau said. His attorney in the Philippines, Mario Ope\u00f1a, told CNN that the priest maintains the allegations are false.\n\n\"As far as Father Hendricks is concerned, the allegations are not true and he will prove his innocence in court,\" Ope\u00f1a said.\n\nHow the investigation started\n\nHendricks has been a priest in Naval, a city of about 50,000 people in central Philippines, the country's Bureau of Immigration said.\n\nHe was ordained as a priest in the Philippines after arriving in the country in the 1960s, said the Rev. Benjamin Pantas, spokesman for the Diocese of Naval.\n\nThe Naval diocese is conducting a parallel, independent investigation, Pantas said.\n\nOf the allegations cited by the five accusers in a probable cause affidavit filed in court, the earliest dates to 2009. The accusers' ages at the start of the alleged abuse range from 7 to the teens, Glassman said.\n\nThe Philippine National Police began investigating around November 6 when two accusers, including a young man, came forward, the affidavit says.\n\nAmong the man's allegations, according to the document:\n\n\u2022 Hendricks began sexually abusing him around 2009 when he was a 12-year-old serving as a sacristan in a church in Naval. Hendricks first kissed him on the lips while the boy was cleaning the church.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would beg him to sleep at the priest's home, and the accuser believed he had no choice. The priest would insist that they bathe together, and the priest would have oral and anal sex with him.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would molest him alone or with several other boys who \"resided with Hendricks during that time.\"\n\n\u2022 Hendricks said they \"would both go to jail\" if the abuse was reported to authorities.\n\n\u2022 The abuse stopped when the accuser was 15, after he contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAnother of the accusers alleged that Hendricks had anal sex at least a dozen times and oral sex more than 30 times, the Cincinnati US attorney's office said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when or how the US Homeland Security Investigations agents got involved. But HSI agents interviewed the adult accuser and four other accusers November 26-28, the affidavit says.\n\n'I ... will have to probably really resign, retire now'\n\nHSI received a recorded conversation, purportedly between Hendricks and the adult accuser in November, in which the two apparently discuss the accuser having talked to police, the affidavit says.\n\nIn the recording, the priest said he's \"waiting for the fallout,\" according to the affidavit.\n\n\"There will be a meeting and then it will be decided, you know, what your parents want to do about anything. Do they want to try ... to press charges ... but that's between them and the bishop,\" Hendricks said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"They will decide, ask you what your decision is, what you're going to do, whether there will be a case or not or whether, you know, a settlement, I don't know. But as far as after that, I don't know what's going to happen. I really will have to probably really resign, retire now,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\nEventually, the affidavit says, the accuser asked whether Hendricks admits to having sex with boys.\n\n\"It's already blottered,\" Hendricks said, apparently referring to the accuser's conversation with police. \"You put it on a blotter. Will I lie? It was a mistake on my part. Should have known better than trying to just have life,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Other children may have been impacted'\n\nGlassman, the US attorney, said Hendricks is not accused of abusing anyone in the United States, but investigators will explore the time he has spent in his native country.\n\nHendricks would spend several months a year in the United States -- likely in the Cincinnati area, after flying from the Philippines into Los Angeles, Glassman said.\n\nThe federal prosecutor said he didn't immediately know exactly where or how Hendricks would spend his time in the United States. But the affidavit says bank records indicate Hendricks has a residence in Cincinnati.\n\n\"We want to find out: Are there any victims in the United States -- in Cincinnati, in Ohio, Los Angeles or wherever?\" Glassman said during a news conference Thursday in Cincinnati. \"(We want to) hold Father Hendricks accountable for any sexual abuse of children here, just as we want to hold him accountable for any sexual abuse that he's committed in the Philippines.\"\n\nFrancis, the HSI agent, said: \"We believe there is a high probability that other children may have been impacted by his alleged actions.\"\n\nAsked whether the Philippines would want to put Hendricks on trial there instead of extraditing him to the United States, Glassman said: \"That is something we are working out with them right now.\"\n\nHendricks was not a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, archdiocese spokesman Mike Schafer said.\n\nThe priest as listed on the archdiocese's website as being a missionary in the Philippines.\n\nBut Schafer, in email to CNN, wrote that Hendricks \"is not 'assigned internationally by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati to mission work.'\"\n\n\"Hendricks is not, nor never has been, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Philippines to serve in a diocese there,\" Schafer wrote.\n\nToni Cashnelli, communications director for the Franciscan Friars, Province of St. John the Baptist in Cincinnati, said Hendricks was a brother with the Franciscan Friars.\n\nHe made temporary vows in 1962, solemn vows in 1965 and in 1986 asked to be released, Cashnelli said.

For a month, she tried to get rid of it using a neti pot with tap water instead of using sterile water, as is recommended.\n\nNeti pots are used to pour saline into one nostril and out of the other to irrigate the sinuses, usually to fight allergies or infections.\n\nAccording to the doctors who treated the woman, the non-sterile water that she used it thought to have contained Balamuthia mandrillaris , \ufeffan amoeba that over the course of weeks to months can cause a very rare and almost always fatal infection in the brain.\n\nFascinating, mysterious, and medically amazing case files.

Doctors thought it was a rash and prescribed an antibiotic ointment, but that provided no relief. Over the course of a year, dermatologists hunted for a diagnosis.\n\nThen, the left side of the woman's body started shaking. She'd experienced a seizure that weakened her left arm. A CT scan showed an abnormal lesion in her brain that indicated she might have a tumor, so doctors sent a sample of tissue for testing.\n\nOver the next several days, additional scans revealed that whatever was happening in her brain was getting worse. The mass was growing, and new lesions were starting to show up.\n\nFinally, a neurosurgeon at Swedish Medical Center, where the woman was being treated, opened her skull to examine her brain and found that it was infected with amoebae.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rushed the anti-amoeba drug miltefosine to Seattle to try to save the woman's life, but she fell into a coma and died.\n\nAccording to the CDC, most cases of Balamuthia mandrillaris aren't diagnosed until immediately before death or after death, so doctors don't have a lot of experience treating the amoeba and know little about how a person becomes infected.\n\nThe amoeba was discovered in 1986. Since 1993, the CDC says, there have been at least 70 cases in the United States.\n\nAs in the Seattle woman's case, the infections are \"almost uniformly fatal,\" with a death rate of more than 89%, according to the doctors who treated her and the CDC.\n\nThe amoeba is similar to Naegleria fowleri , which has been the culprit in several high-profile cases.\n\nIn 2011, Louisiana health officials warned residents not to use nonsterilized tap water in neti pots after the deaths of two people who were exposed to Naegleria fowleri while flushing their nasal passages.

Texas' governor on Friday raised the state's official readiness level as the stormed pushed in, while his counterpart in North Carolina announced he'll declare a statewide state of emergency.\n\nAs the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nHere is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when:\n\nTexas and Oklahoma\n\nTiming: Friday morning through Saturday evening\n\nPrecipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday.\n\nImpacts: Snow, ice and flooding rain\n\nSnowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. As of Friday evening, Austin had 2.95 inches of rain and an area of east Texas saw 3.4 inches.\n\nNearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots.\n\nOklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches.\n\nArkansas and western Tennessee\n\nTiming: Friday afternoon through Saturday\n\nMost Arkansans didn't get precipitation until later Friday, and winter weather was predicted to begin in the overnight hours and move east Saturday morning toward Tennessee.\n\nImpacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow\n\nThe southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch.\n\nSnow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible.\n\nEastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nTiming: Saturday morning through Monday morning\n\nPrecipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas.\n\nImpacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix\n\nSignificant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a \"once-in-a-generation event.\" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow.\n\nWhile most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon.\n\nSnow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called \"cold-air damming\" or \"the wedge\" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a \"warm nose\" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the \"'wedge,\" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Prosecutors: Michael Cohen acted at Trump's direction when he broke the law", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/0ui5FEyRWHQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) Federal prosecutors said for the first time Friday that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Donald Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign, as special counsel Robert Mueller outlined a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nThose revelations came in a set of court filings in which federal prosecutors in New York said Cohen should receive a \"substantial\" prison sentence of roughly four years for tax fraud and campaign-finance crimes, and as Mueller's office accused the President's former attorney of lying about his contacts with Russia.\n\nMueller's disclosures also exposed deeper entanglements than previously known between Trump, his campaign apparatus and the Russian government, including that a Russian national who claimed to be well-connected in Moscow spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe pair of memos from two sets of prosecutors reflected competing views of Cohen's utility to the federal investigations ahead of his scheduled sentencing on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors added, \"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.\" Individual-1 is the term prosecutors have been using to refer to the President.\n\nIn their filing, prosecutors from the Manhattan US attorney's office knocked Cohen's \"rose-colored view of the seriousness of his crimes,\" noting his years-long willingness to break the law. \"He was motivated to do so by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends,\" they wrote in a filing that also sought to puncture Cohen's public pronouncements of assistance in their investigations.\n\nMueller's team acknowledged that Cohen provided \"useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation,\" but also disclosed that he had initially lied to them about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes after being charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors. Those included tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-presidential candidate. Trump has denied those claims.\n\nContact with Russians\n\nCohen was subsequently charged last week by the special counsel's office with one count of lying to Congress about the Moscow project. He pleaded guilty, disclosing that talks about the effort in Moscow had extended through June 2016, after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and that both Trump and his family members had been briefed on the discussions. Cohen also acknowledged pursuing plans to send Trump and himself to Russia in service of the project and discussing the proposed development directly with a representative of the Kremlin.\n\nThe special counsel's Friday memo on the matter suggested that Cohen's -- and, by extension, Trump's -- intersection with Russians eager to aid the presidential campaign was more substantial than previously known, with the Russians anxious to put Trump face-to-face with their president.\n\nIn one instance, Cohen spoke in November 2015 to a Russian national who offered \"synergy on a government level\" to the Trump presidential campaign and \"repeatedly proposed\" a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to court papers.\n\nThe interest appears to have been reciprocal. Cohen told the special counsel that he had consulted with Trump about his interest in contacting the Russian government before suggesting in a radio interview in September 2015 that Trump meet with Putin during the Russian President's visit to New York City that fall.\n\nCohen had previously claimed his comments on air were spontaneous, the court papers said, but he admitted to prosecutors that they came about after his discussion with Trump.\n\nThat meeting never happened, nor did the one with the Russian national, although Cohen told the special counsel that was due to the fact that he was working on the Moscow project \"with a different individual who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.\"\n\nMueller's sentencing memo also provided the first explanation of the Trump Tower Moscow project's relevance to Russia's interference during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAccording to the special counsel, Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThat Cohen continued to work on the Trump Tower Moscow project -- and discuss it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, prosecutors said, noting in particular that \"it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nA tightening net\n\nThe filings on Cohen, and a submission from Mueller about Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, appear to further tighten the net that Mueller is gathering around the President and his inner circle.\n\nThey come at a time when Trump appears to be increasingly worried and furious about the investigation, following a searing tweet storm aimed at the special counsel on Friday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed the significance of prosecutors' findings, saying late Friday that \"the government's filings in Mr. Cohen's case tell us nothing of value that wasn't already known. Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\"\n\nThe memos also appear to take aim at several issues that have and could continue to ensnare others in the President's orbit, including the act of lying not just to federal agents but also to the public and the media. Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project, they said, constituted an attempt to alter the course of the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses,\" prosecutors wrote. \"By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nProsecutors unhappy with Cohen's cooperation\n\nDespite Cohen's disclosures to the special counsel, however, Manhattan federal prosecutors sought repeatedly to emphasize the limited nature of his assistance in other investigations.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors have continued to investigate the Trump Organization based on information in the charges against Cohen, CNN has reported, and Cohen met with prosecutors to discuss \"the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes,\" they said in their filing. But, they noted, he \"declined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest.\"\n\nProsecutors also said the information Cohen has provided to the New York State Attorney General's Office, which has a civil lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation, \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\nAnd while Cohen has met with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which has also been examining the Trump Organization, CNN has reported, his assistance \"appears to consist solely of providing that entity information that they would otherwise have obtained via subpoena.\"\n\nThe Cohen cases are being considered together for sentencing purposes. In the New York federal prosecutors' case, the sentencing guidelines call for a term of 51 to 63 months in prison, and prosecutors on Friday asked the court to \"impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable guidelines range.\"\n\nUS District Judge William Pauley III can deviate from the guidelines when he determines Cohen's sentence.\n\nCohen's attorneys have asked the court to give him no prison time, but prosecutors on Friday voiced their objection to that proposal, noting that the crimes Cohen committed had far-reaching consequences that extended all the way to the White House.\n\n\"While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\" they wrote.\n\n\"He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1,\" they said. \"In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller opened the floodgates on Cohen and Manafort", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/2WQk6dd6eTM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) In what has been a slow drip of information on Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, the spigot opened up today with insight on four key players:\n\n1) Michael Cohen: Southern District of New York investigators today asked the court to impose a \" : Southern District of New York investigators today asked the court to impose a \" substantial term of imprisonment \" for Cohen's various finance-related crimes -- and that Cohen \"was motivated ... by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\"\n\nWhy it matters: While prosecutors don't mince words about Cohen -- and stop short of calling him a cooperative witness -- they do say he has been helpful in the investigation, providing \"relevant and useful information\" on contacts with \"persons connected to the White House.\" Cohen is set to be sentenced next Wednesday.\n\nWhy it matters: We found out last week that Mueller's team accused Manafort of lying, and now we know what they think Manafort was lying about.

Mueller has said Kilimnik has ties to the Russian military intelligence unit accused of hacking the Democrats, and they've previously outlined how the two men may have worked together to tamper with witnesses following Manafort's arrest last year.\n\nThe accusations by Mueller add to growing signs that the special counsel's team has a wealth of evidence about contacts between people close to Trump -- even in the White House -- and Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe document also contains the stunning disclosure that Mueller can show, including with text messages, that Manafort was in contact with Trump administration officials early this year -- even after he was indicted in late 2017.\n\nThe new and damaging information for the White House comes at a time when every move by Mueller appears to bring his investigation deeper into the White House and Trump's inner circle, and shows it has expanded well beyond what may or may not have happened in the 2016 campaign.\n\nMueller last week accused Manafort of lying during his interviews, saying that his actions during his cooperation were criminal and breached his plea agreement.\n\nThe investigators also say they have evidence about electronic communications related to Kilimnik and travel records, and they make clear in the document they have investigated \"meetings\" between Manafort and Kilimnik.\n\nThe special counsel believes Manafort also lied about a wire transfer made to a firm he had working for him in 2017 and \"information pertinent to another Department of Justice investigation.\"\n\nThe filing is the first time prosecutors have summarized why and how they believe Manafort breached his plea agreement. Previously, Mueller simply told a federal judge Manafort \"committed federal crimes by lying\" to the FBI and special counsel's office during his cooperation interviews \"on a variety of subject matters.\"\n\nManafort says he has been truthful over several meetings with the special counsel's office. His lawyers indicated last week that they may challenge the assertion that he lied.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders brushed off the filing from Mueller.\n\n\"The government's filing in Mr. Manafort's case says absolutely nothing about the President,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"It says even less about collusion and is devoted almost entirely to lobbying-related issues. Once again the media is trying to create a story where there isn't one.\"\n\nProsecutors say Manafort lied about contacting officials\n\nMueller's team outlined how they believe Manafort lied \"in multiple ways and on multiple occasions.\"\n\nManafort lied to the special counsel's office on contact with the administration this year, the document alleged.\n\nHe told a person via text message to talk to a Trump administration official in May, and separately he was in touch with the administration through February 2018, according to the document.\n\nThe prosecutors also cite \"additional contacts with administration officials,\" citing \"electronic documents\" they have.\n\nManafort was indicted last October and has been in jail since June.\n\nManafort told Mueller's office after he began cooperating, he had \"no direct or indirect communications with anyone in the administration while they were in the administration and that he never asked anyone to try to communicate a message to anyone in the administration on any subject matter.\"\n\nProsecutors cite evidence they have of Manafort's contacts with \"administration officials,\" including one who is a \"senior administration official,\" in February and May of this year. They cite text messages as evidence, and a description they have from \"another Manafort colleague.\"\n\nThe filing from prosecutors Friday does not say what Manafort was attempting to discuss with the administration while he was facing multiple charges from Mueller.\n\nManafort allegedly lied about meetings with Russian associate\n\nMueller said on Friday that Manafort lied to investigators about his interactions with Kilimnik, his former business associate who has ties to Russian intelligence. Specifically, prosecutors discussed with Manafort more than one meeting he had with Kilimnik.\n\nThere are very few public details about their interactions. But questions of collusion have swirled around Kilimnik, given his longtime closeness to Manafort and his links to Russian intelligence agencies that were aggressively meddling in the election. Mueller's team said earlier this year that the FBI believes Kilimnik had active ties to Russian spies in 2016.\n\nProsecutors said they caught Manafort in lies about Kilimnik because they have \"electronic communications\" and \"travel records.\" Mueller's team said they confronted Manafort with this evidence and he acknowledged his lies. But besides these breadcrumbs, critical parts from Friday's filing about Kilimnik were heavily redacted by Mueller's office.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last year that Manafort and Kilimnik met twice during the campaign. Manafort acknowledged to the Post that they discussed WikiLeaks releases against the Democratic National Committee because they were in the news at the time. Mueller's team said Friday that Manafort lied to them about a \"meeting with Kilimnik,\" but that section is heavily redacted.\n\nThe Post also reported that Manafort and Kilimnik exchanged emails in 2016 about offering \"private briefings\" about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, a prominent Russian oligarch. Manafort has said those briefings never occurred.\n\nKilimnik has denied working for Russian intelligence. Manafort denies colluding with any Russians. Kilimnik and Manafort were charged with obstruction of justice in June for trying to influence witnesses who could testify at Manafort's trial. Manafort pleaded guilty to obstruction in September, but Kilimnik lives safely in Russia, out of the reach of US courts.\n\nWhat Manafort knows\n\nThe details of what happened during Manafort's cooperation interviews with the special counsel have been one of the most intensely pursued questions of the Russia probe -- from what Manafort knows, to what happened in recent weeks. Even President Donald Trump's lawyers have tried to stay in the loop regarding what he and Mueller's team spoke about.\n\nManafort has long been considered the key to several questions central to Mueller's investigation into Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nManafort attended the June 2016 campaign meeting at Trump Tower with Russians who had offered the campaign information on Hillary Clinton. His tenure on the campaign coincided with the Russian hackers' efforts to steal Democratic Party and Clinton campaign emails and distribute them publicly. He also led the campaign through the Republican National Convention, when the party decided to soften its stance on US assistance to Ukraine against Russian-backed militias.\n\nAt first last year, Mueller charged Manafort with crimes unrelated to his work as chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\nBut it later became clear the special counsel sought documents and information about Russians Manafort knew, including his longtime colleague Kilimnik and Deripaska, to whom Manafort owed millions.\n\nProsecutors have also looked for records Manafort may have had that showed possible campaign finance violations such as illegal contributions made from foreign nationals, according to search warrants of his condo.\n\nManafort's financial fraud trial centered around millions of dollars he earned doing Ukrainian political consulting years ago. Yet his trial on those charges veered toward his role on the Trump campaign when prosecutors alleged he used his proximity to Trump to secure a multi-million-dollar loan from a banker interested in being secretary of the Army or another top administration role.\n\nWhat's to come\n\nThe failure of Manafort's cooperation could lead to more criminal charges, prosecutors have said. It also sets into motion a schedule that will lead up to his sentencing.\n\nManafort is now set to be the sixth Mueller defendant to face sentencing.\n\nBoth former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen and former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the federal government and will be sentenced separately in the next two weeks.\n\nThree other less-high-profile defendants earned between two weeks and 6 months in prison.\n\nManafort is scheduled to receive his first sentence, for eight financial convictions decided by a Virginia jury, in early February.\n\nHis second sentencing date, before the judge who's handling the breach of his plea agreement, is tentatively set for early March.\n\nFor the two charges he currently faces in DC federal court, Manafort could receive 17 to 22 years in prison, his plea agreement says.\n\nThe last time Manafort was seen in public he entered court in a wheelchair, with a foot bandaged, apparently suffering from an illness similar to gout. That was about two months ago.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Read: Sentencing memorandums for Michael Cohen", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/fQe6vfG4e1k/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health.

However, 44 health workers have been infected with the virus, of whom 12 have died.\n\nNorth Kivu province, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organization. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\n\"Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in north-eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge,\" WHO said in a report Thursday.\n\nWHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.\n\nGender imbalance\n\nWomen and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thursday . To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.\n\nThe \"multitude of factors\" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO.\n\n\"Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 out of 118),\" WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major clinical trial conducted during an outbreak in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFresh guidance issued Thursday by the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies Working Group, an international team of 17 experts, seeks to ensure that pregnant women are no longer excluded from receiving vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.\n\nThe public health preparedness report, which offers concrete steps for equitably addressing the needs of pregnant women, includes 22 total recommendations. One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that \"we are in deep trouble with climate change.\"\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.\n\n\"The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nThose recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.\n\nThe report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.\n\nGeneral climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.\n\nOnly about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.\n\n'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'\n\nThe new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication . She was not involved in the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED New climate change report issues stark warning Replay More Videos ...

It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area.

led to an \"inaccurate\" story about federal funding of controversial fetal tissue research, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.\n\nHHS's National Institutes of Health has made no decision on whether to extend a University of California, San Francisco contract for controversial research involving fetal tissue, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS.\n\nHer statement contradicts Washington Post reporting Tuesday that the \"Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract\" with UCSF to test new treatments for HIV.\n\nAccording to the Post, an anonymous source said a National Institutes of Health official told a UCSF investigator that the decision to end a seven-year contract before its completion was coming from the \"highest levels.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Washington Post chose to report assertions that are completely false,\" Oakley said.\n\nOakley said that there were \"no traceable records\" proving these claims made by the Post's anonymous source and that \"multiple, on-the-record assurances from senior officials at both the National Institutes of Health and in the Office of the Secretary\" told the Post that the claims were incorrect.\n\nThe Post also reported that a letter from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the contract would continue for 90 days rather than the expected year-long renewal.\n\n\"No contracting official would have had the authority to impart any communication to UCSF that the contract was being cancelled because no decision has been made,\" Oakley said.\n\nRenate Myles, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said on Thursday that \"NIH did, however, send a letter to UCSF to notify them of our intent to ensure continuity of service for 90 days while the audit continues and until a final decision is made on the contract.\"\n\nDoan would not comment, though she said the \"research is conducted in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as ethical standards.\"\n\nOakley emphasized that \"a decision will be made when the contract has been reviewed, pursuant to the ongoing audit/review process\" initiated by the HHS in September\n\nThe battle over human fetal tissue research\n\nTwo months ago, the HHS did terminate a contract: one struck between the Food and Drug Administration (an agency within the HHS) and a biotech company that was slated to provide about $16,000 of human fetal tissue for federal research.\n\nThe FDA explained in a notice posted online that \"fresh human tissues are required\" to create mice with human immune systems, which is necessary when testing drugs \"for safety and efficacy.\"\n\nHowever, a response letter from more than 80 House Republications to the FDA called for the cancellation of this federal contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.\n\nIn September, the HHS not only terminated the contract, it stated that \"in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,\" it had \"initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\" while \"continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\"\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is obtained through elective abortions and is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows . Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration. In its September statement, HHS concluded that it is continuing to review \"whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue\" and \"will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Grace Millane: New Zealand Police to charge man with murder", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-46492477", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Lucie Blackman Trust Image caption The 22-year-old graduated from university in September and went travelling shortly afterwards\n\nA 26-year-old man is to be charged with the murder of missing British backpacker Grace Millane, New Zealand Police have said.\n\nMiss Milane, 22, from Essex - described by her father as \"lovely\" and \"family-orientated\" - was last seen in New Zealand a week ago.\n\nDet Insp Scott Beard said the evidence told them she was \"no longer alive\".\n\nThe man will remain in police custody until Monday when he is due in court, police said.\n\nOn Saturday, police announced they believe Miss Millane has been murdered.\n\n\"Grace's family have been advised of this development and they are devastated,\" Det Insp Beard added.\n\nThe announcement follows a review of CCTV footage, the forensic examination of a hotel where she was last seen on Saturday 1 December, and the discovery of a vehicle.\n\nMiss Millane's body has not been found, but Det Insp Beard said police were \"determined to do everything we can to find her\".\n\nHe added the \"thoughts of all New Zealanders will be with Grace's family tonight\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Det Insp Scott Beard said they believed Miss Millane was \"no longer alive\"\n\nMiss Millane, who graduated from the University of Lincoln in September, had been travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following a six-week group trip through South America.\n\nShe had booked to stay at the Base Backpackers hostel in central Auckland until 8 December.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Auckland on Friday, Grace's father, David Millane, said his daughter had been \"bombarding us with numerous photographs and messages of her adventures\" before she went missing.\n\nA number of Miss Millane's belongings - including her passport, a silver necklace and pink watch - are missing, and police say they hope their discovery could help them locate her body.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Police released CCTV images of the backpacker at Auckland's Sky City entertainment complex before she disappeared"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Yellow vest movement: France braced for 'ultra-violent' protests", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46492070", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption There is a heavier security presence than on previous weekends of the protests\n\nFrance is braced for renewed anti-government protests, with nearly 90,000 security personnel on the streets.\n\nSome 8,000 officers and 12 armoured vehicles have been deployed in Paris alone, where shops are boarded up and sites like the Eiffel Tower closed.\n\nThirty-two people have been detained in Paris but the streets are so far calm.\n\nThe \"yellow vest\" movement began three weeks ago in opposition to a rise in fuel tax but ministers say it has been hijacked by \"ultra-violent\" protesters.\n\nLast week, hundreds of people were arrested and scores injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades.\n\nWhat is happening this weekend?\n\nParis streets appear to be quieter than on previous Saturdays.\n\nA few hundred people gathered on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and marched a short distance to a police cordon where they stopped.

Thank you!\" although it was unclear to what he was referring.\n\nWhat was in the Mueller memo on Cohen?\n\nIt is a government sentencing memorandum on the one charge of lying to Congress.\n\nCohen had admitted making false statements about a Trump property deal, out of loyalty to the president.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The memo from Robert Mueller's office says there were \"sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election\"\n\nThe memo says that although this crime was serious, any sentencing should be served concurrently with the New York prosecutors' recommendations on other crimes.\n\nThe memo says Cohen has taken \"significant steps to mitigate his criminal conduct\".\n\nThe key elements of the memo are about the Russian links. They are that Cohen:\n\n\"Provided information about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign and discussions with others in the course of making those contacts\"\n\n\"Also provided information about attempts by other Russian nationals to reach the campaign\"\n\nSpoke to \"a Russian national who claimed to be a 'trusted person' in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign 'political synergy' and 'synergy on a government level'\". This person proposed a meeting between Individual 1 (previously identified by Cohen as Mr Trump) and the Russian president, saying it could have a \"phenomenal\" impact \"not only in political but in a business dimension as well\". The meeting did not take place\n\nProvided \"relevant and useful information concerning his contacts with persons connected to the White House during the 2017-2018 time period\n\nWhat was in the New York prosecutors' memo?\n\nThe New York prosecutors' submission said Cohen had committed four federal crimes over several years.\n\n\"He was motivated to do so by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends,\" the filing said.\n\nOne of the crimes Cohen admitted was paying hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump. This could amount to a violation of US campaign finance laws.\n\nWhile the prosecutors accepted Cohen's help with the Mueller investigation should be taken into account in sentencing, they said it should only bring a \"modest\" reduction on the guidelines of four to five years.\n\nWhat do the Cohen memos all mean?\n\nAnalysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher\n\nIn a one-two punch of court filings, the memos say that Cohen should get credit for providing useful information to investigators. But not too much credit.\n\nSome of the information in the special counsel's document is already known. The negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow, which lasted well into the 2016 presidential campaign, were once again outlined.\n\nBut the document drives home the point that Donald Trump was kept informed about the possible deal, which could have netted \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" and that the negotiations took place \"at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US election\".\n\nOther details Cohen supplied are largely left to the imagination.\n\nThe president is also once again implicated in the campaign finance charges against Cohen. The New York prosecutors state that Mr Trump's lawyer acted to silence two women who claim they had affairs with Mr Trump in order to \"influence the 2016 presidential election\". What's more, Cohen \"acted in co-ordination with and at the direction of Individual 1\".\n\nWhat all this means is that prosecutors in New York and Washington are claiming the president had implicit knowledge and involvement in a campaign finance crime. He also had knowledge of a massive property deal that involved contacts with Russian government officials while he was running for president in an election that was being targeted for influence by the Russian government.\n\nThe picture they paint is a dark one.\n\nThe Manafort memo\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nPaul Manafort served for five months with the Trump campaign team, three of them as campaign manager, before being sacked.\n\nThis latest memo, from Mr Mueller's office, tries to spell out how the special counsel believes Manafort breached a plea bargain deal by lying to investigators.\n\nManafort was convicted of financial fraud in August relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea bargain deal under which he would help with the Russia inquiry.\n\nThe deal had meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prison, with certain charges dismissed. His lawyers deny he has lied.\n\nThe memo lists five allegations of breaching the deal by lying:\n\nOn his interaction with Konstantin Kilimnik, a business associate who Mr Mueller says is tied to Russian intelligence. The actual allegations in the memo are redacted\n\nA second case involving Kilimnik and obstruction of justice\n\nPayment to a firm working for Manafort\n\nOn a separate department of justice inquiry\n\nOn contacts with Trump administration officials\n\nThe memo calls these \"multiple discernible lies - these were not instances of mere memory lapse\".\n\nOur correspondent, Anthony Zurcher, says that given the central focus of Mr Mueller's investigation is Russia-Trump links, the Kilimnik connection could prove to be of particular interest.\n\nMore on Trump and Russia"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Yellow vest movement: France braced for 'ultra-violent' protests", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46492070", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:24", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption There is a heavier security presence than on previous weekends of the protests\n\nFrance is braced for renewed anti-government protests, with nearly 90,000 security personnel on the streets.\n\nSome 8,000 officers and 12 armoured vehicles have been deployed in Paris alone, where shops are boarded up and sites like the Eiffel Tower closed.\n\nThirty-two people have been detained in Paris but the streets are so far calm.\n\nThe \"yellow vest\" movement began three weeks ago in opposition to a rise in fuel tax but ministers say it has been hijacked by \"ultra-violent\" protesters.\n\nLast week, hundreds of people were arrested and scores injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades.\n\nWhat is happening this weekend?\n\nParis streets appear to be quieter than on previous Saturdays.\n\nA few hundred people gathered on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and marched a short distance to a police cordon where they stopped.

But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness \"probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion\".\n\nHe also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nSir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more \"risk averse\" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment. Well, that is not acceptable.\"\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Chang'e-4: China mission launches to far side of Moon", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46471668", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:57", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright CNSA Image caption Artwork: The Chang'e-4 rover will explore a huge impact basin on the far side\n\nChina has launched the first mission to land a robotic craft on the far side of the Moon, Chinese media say.\n\nThe Chang'e-4 mission will see a static lander and rover touch down in Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater, located on the side of the Moon which never faces Earth.\n\nThe payload blasted off atop a Long March 3B rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center.\n\nThe mission will pave the way for the country to deliver samples of Moon rock and soil to Earth.\n\nThe landing will not occur until early January, when the probe will descend on thrusters and touch down on the rugged terrain of the lunar far side.\n\nVon K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater is of interest to scientists because it is located within the oldest and largest impact feature on the Moon - the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This was probably formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago.\n\nThe landers will characterise the region's geology and the composition of rock and soil.\n\nBecause of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one \"face\" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThough often referred to as the \"dark side\", this face of the Moon is also illuminated by the Sun and has the same phases as the near side; \"dark\" in this context simply means \"unseen\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The lunar far side has a thicker crust and is more heavily cratered than the near side\n\nThe far side looks rather different to the more familiar near side. It has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also few of the \"mare\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nThe powerful impact that created the South Pole Aitken Basin may have punched through the crust down to the Moon's mantle layer. Chang'e-4's instruments could examine whether this was the case, shedding light on the early history of our only natural satellite.\n\nSeed experiment\n\nThe mission will also characterise the \"radio environment\" on the far side, a test designed to lay the groundwork for the creation of future radio astronomy telescopes on the far side, which is shielded from the radio noise of Earth.\n\nThe static lander will carry a 3kg (6.6lb) container with potato and arabidopsis plant seeds to perform a biological experiment. The \"lunar mini biosphere\" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.\n\n\"We want to study the respiration of the seeds and the photosynthesis on the Moon,\" Liu Hanlong, chief director of the experiment and vice president of Chongqing University, told the state-run Xinhua news agency earlier this year.\n\nImage copyright CNSA Image caption China's Yutu rover, part of the Chang'e-3 mission, explored the Moon in 2013\n\nXie Gengxin, chief designer of the experiment, told Xinhua: \"We have to keep the temperature in the 'mini biosphere' within a range from 1 degree to 30 degrees, and properly control the humidity and nutrition. We will use a tube to direct the natural light on the surface of Moon into the tin to make the plants grow.\"\n\nBecause the landers on the far side have no line of sight with our planet, they must send data back via a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year.\n\nThe probe's design is based on that of its predecessor, Chang'e-3, which deployed landing craft to the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. However, it has some important modifications.\n\nChina's lunar ambitions\n\nThe lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform the low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nThe rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface.\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's InSight probe listens to Martian winds", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46489199", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The seismometer data has been raised two octaves to make it more audible (best with headphones)\n\nA UK instrument has captured \"the sound\" of the wind on Mars.\n\nThe British seismometer package carried on Nasa's InSight lander detected the vibrations from Martian air as it rushed over the probe's solar panels.\n\n\"The solar panels on the lander's sides are perfect acoustic receivers,\" said Prof Tom Pike, who leads the seismometer experiment from Imperial College London.\n\n\"It's like InSight is cupping its ears.\"\n\nProf Pike compares the effect to a flag in the wind.

This bell-shaped device will protect SEIS from the weather and allow the sensors to concentrate on their primary task of detecting earthquakes, or rather \"marsquakes\".\n\nCo-investigator Dr Neil Bowles, from the University of Oxford, said: \"To get the first data from the seismometer instrument package has been fantastic and even with a short test run the analysis is now full swing.\n\n\"To 'hear' the low-frequency rumble of the Martian wind on the lander being picked up by [SEIS] is really eerie and provides a strangely human connection to this very different environment.\"\n\nThe UK Space Agency invested \u00a34m in the seismometer package.\n\nThe organisation's head of space exploration, Sue Horne, said: \"This is brilliant news because it means we know the sensors have survived the rigours of landing on Mars and are meeting the requirements to achieve their science goals.\n\n\"It is just amazing to hear the first ever sounds from Mars.\"\n\nThe audio recordings released to the public are almost completely unaltered. In some cases, they have been raised a couple of octaves to make them more perceptible to the human ear.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Bloodhound supersonic car project axed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-46480342", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year\n\nA 1,000mph race car project has been axed meaning the supersonic vehicle is on the market for the price of a Ferrari.\n\nThe Bloodhound supersonic vehicle - built with a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine bolted to a rocket - is all but finished.\n\nThe Bristol-based team behind it was aiming to beat the existing land speed world record of 763mph (1,228km/h).\n\nDriver Andy Green said the car was now available at a cost of about \u00a3250,000.\n\n'Need a few million'\n\nIt was set to go for the record-breaking speed in South Africa, where a 18km-long, 1,500m-wide track at Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape has been prepared for it.\n\n\"You're going to need to find a few million to get it running to full speed,\" said Mr Green who added he knew a team of engineers \"who could help\".\n\n\"We have basically completed the main structure, the desert is ready, we just need the funding.\"\n\nPrevious test runs at Newquay Airport in 2017 saw Bloodhound reach speeds of 200mph (320km/h).\n\nMr Green said he would \"love to see the car run\" and said it was still possible that it could happen.\n\n\"If somebody is out there with a quarter of a million there is a car there.

Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.\n\n\"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.\n\nA previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nJust yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers.\n\nWhile some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development.\n\n\"For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Zoologists Discover New Fastest Land Animal After Pumping White-Tailed Deer Full Of Steroids", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/zoologists-discover-new-fastest-land-animal-after-pumpi-1830946788", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "MADISON, WI\u2014Shedding new light on the now-500-pound forest-dwelling antlered ungulant, zoologists at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced the discovery of a new fastest land animal Friday after systematically subjecting a white-tailed deer to a regimen of specially tailored anabolic steroids. \u201cSome cheetahs can temporarily reach a speed as high as 75 mph, which for much of history made them the fastest terrestrial mammal.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Lowest-Wage Arkansans Will See More Money in 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/lowest-wage-arkansans-will-see-more-money-in-2019/4692119.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Hustle.\n\nThat\u2019s the word Christina Jones uses to describe the way she lives.\n\nThe Arkansas native is a housekeeper at a hospital in the town of Jonesboro, an hour\u2019s drive from Memphis, Tennessee. There, she makes $10 an hour cleaning rooms, changing bed sheets, emptying trash cans. It\u2019s dirty work, and it doesn\u2019t cover all her bills, but Jones says she enjoys it. She is grateful to have the job and smiles so much that her colleagues gave her the nickname \u201cSunshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they only knew that yesterday I had to put my last 20 [dollars] in the car [for fuel], and I\u2019m wondering all weekend how I\u2019m going to pay for my daughter\u2019s lunch,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t stress about it because, again, I just pray Lord, if it\u2019s meant for me to have it this week, you\u2019re going to provide for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nJones recently shifted from temporary status to full time, meaning she will soon be eligible for employer-subsidized health insurance. That will save her money every month but even then, her paychecks won\u2019t cover all the expenses she and her teenage daughter have.\n\nAt the same time, Jones makes too much to qualify for government anti-poverty programs, although her daughter is eligible for subsidized health insurance. To afford her monthly car payment, rent, food, gas and utilities, Jones supplements her hospital job by cutting grass and cleaning people\u2019s homes, regularly working from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. She says it would be hard to make it all work if her daughter was young enough to still require child care.\n\n\u201cAll the extra money that you make, you have to hold it. You can\u2019t blow it,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u200bMinimum wage rises\n\nThe lowest-paid Arkansans will enjoy a pay raise Jan. 1 when the minimum wage rises by 50 cents an hour to $9, but Jones will have to wait longer for some relief. Employers will be required by law to pay no less than $10 an hour beginning in 2020 and $11 an hour in 2021.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, a police officer\u2019s starting salary in Arkansas is as low as $11.50 an hour; and an emergency medical technician (EMT) makes less than that. Though still not considered a living wage, which hovers around $15 an hour in Arkansas, it will be much higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\nBecause of the southern state\u2019s relatively low cost of living, the new wage will also be considered one of the highest effective minimum wages anywhere in the United States. By the time it\u2019s fully implemented, it\u2019s expected to affect about 25 percent of the workforce.\n\nThe new law, which was passed through a ballot initiative in early November, received overwhelming support from voters, but some have expressed concern over its implementation. (A ballot initiative is a piece of legislation that is approved or rejected by voters.)\n\n\u201cFor something to go up 30 percent in the next two years is pretty unusual,\u201d said Jeremy Horpedahl, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big cost increase to try and fold into your budget.\u201d\n\nHorpedahl said he expects the effects will be \u201call over the board,\u201d with nonprofit organizations \u201cuniversally impacted.\u201d\n\nAdvocates say that more money in more pockets will stimulate the Arkansan economy. But critics of the initiative, including Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, warned that the potential drawbacks would outweigh the benefits; they say some people may see their employer-sponsored benefits like health insurance reduced or even lose their jobs.\n\nBrent Peterson, co-owner of a restaurant in the state capital of Little Rock, is glad that wages will be rising.\n\nTrio\u2019s Restaurant currently pays all employees more than the required minimum wage, but by 2021, the restaurant will have to figure out how to raise the wage of its lowest earners. To accommodate this, Peterson said, the restaurant will likely increase menu prices, something he didn\u2019t seem too worried about.\n\n\u201cWe raised [prices] about six months ago, and it was only a quarter here or 50 cents here,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThere was no sticker shock with our clientele.\u201d\n\nSome fears\n\nNot everyone has the same confidence that the gaps can be easily closed.\n\n\u201cMaybe it will help our economy, but I can also see where it\u2019s going to hurt a lot of people,\u201d said hair stylist Ashley Holland from the town of Heber Springs, in central Arkansas.\n\nHolland said the wage increase won\u2019t personally affect her, as she already makes more than the minimum wage. In fact, she said she might benefit from attracting more clients, who will be able to afford her prices.\n\nHolland is more concerned with how other local businesses, some already struggling to get by, will manage to pay their employees. For years, storefronts along Main Street have been closing or looking for new tenants, partly because of foot traffic (customers) being redirected to online businesses.\n\n\u201cI can understand a little increase, but I think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Holland said.\n\nJones sympathizes.\n\n\u201cI understand that, too. They can lose out on what they got going on,\u201d she said.\n\nEven when the pay hike takes effect in 2021, it won\u2019t be enough for Jones to walk away from her side gigs. But when it does, she plans to maintain her current budget and put the extra money away for her daughter\u2019s future college expenses.\n\n\u201cAnything is always better, more is always better than less,\u201d Jones said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Prosecutors Expose Trump Hush Money Payments, Russian Contacts", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-expose-trump-hush-money-payments-russian-contacts/4692122.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "Court filings Friday from prosecutors in New York and special counsel Robert Mueller laid out why Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, and Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, deserve prison time.\n\nThe filings say Cohen made illegal hush money payments to two women \u2014 Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 ahead of the 2016 election to keep them quiet about their sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Cohen made the payments in \u201ccoordination with and the direction of\u201d Trump.\n\nThe filings also disclose an attempt by a Russian to wield influence in the campaign.\n\nIn one filing, Mueller details how Cohen spoke to a Russian who \u201cclaimed to be a \u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign \u2018political synergy\u2019 and \u2018synergy on a government level.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia, and Russia has denied any interference in the U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nThe filings also exposed lies told by Manafort during interviews with prosecutors and the FBI.\n\nManafort told \u201cmultiple discernible lies,\u201d the court documents said, including about his communications with a political consultant with alleged ties to Russian intelligence and about interacting with Trump administration officials after Manafort was indicted in 2017.\n\nWhile Trump Tweeted \u201cTotally clears the President.

Many were quick to voice concern that the move could derail trade talks, and it came as both sides were hailing last weekend's meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping as a \"big success.\"\n\nSo far, Trump and his administration have been strangely quiet on the topic, analysts said.\n\nChristopher Balding, a China scholar at Fulbright University Vietnam, said that from China's perspective, Meng's arrest was a political escalation and the Trump administration seemed to understand that.\n\n\"I think it is going to be very important that they say that these are the relevant laws, that they try to remove politics from this as much as possible, whatever the exact specifics of the case are,\" Balding said.\n\n\"Even if this was completely and entirely divorced from anybody in the Trump administration, Beijing is going to receive it as a significant political escalation,\" he said.\n\nMing Xia, a professor of political science and global affairs at City University of New York, said Meng's arrest was another example of how members of Trump's trade team know how to use very sharp, pinpoint moves to teach China a lesson.\n\n\"This is one of the U.S.'s many tactics and tools used in its trade war with China to maximize its gains. The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, I believe, should be seen in the context of the Sino-U.S. trade war,\" Xia said.\n\nFor now, both sides have expressed their confidence that the agreement reached last week was a good one and their hope that it will be a success. How Meng's case will play out remains to be seen.\n\nChina has demanded the chief financial officer's release and labeled her detention a \"gross violation of human rights.\" Huawei has said \"the company has been provided with little information regarding the charges and it\u2019s not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng.\"\n\nAt a hearing Friday in Vancouver, a Canadian prosecutor argued that Meng \u2014 who has spent most of the past week at a women's detention facility in a suburb of Vancouver \u2014 should be denied bail pending possible extradition to the United States because she was a flight risk.\n\nSkyCom\n\nA prosecutor disclosed that Meng was wanted by the United States for allegedly deceiving financial institutions about the relationship between Huawei and another tech company, SkyCom, based in Hong Kong, that is alleged to have sold U.S.-manufactured technology to Iran, in violation of U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nA judge is to rule on the bail request Monday.\n\nReports from Reuters have previously suggested that over the past decade, Huawei has struck deals to resell embargoed technologies, owned by U.S. companies including Hewlett-Packard, to sanctioned telecom operators in Iran.\n\nChinese state media have argued that the United States was abusing the law to hurt Huawei's international reputation. However, concerns about Huawei have been growing for quite some time. Many view Huawei as a national security and privacy threat due to its close links to the Chinese government.\n\nOn Friday, there were reports that Tokyo appeared to be the latest country that plans to ban the purchase of Huawei products.\n\nEarlier this week, Britain's BT Group announced that it was removing Huawei Technologies equipment from 3G and 4G networks as well as banning it from core parts of the coming 5G network. Australia and New Zealand also have similar bans in place regarding fifth-generation networks.\n\nOn Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that a federally appointed monitor at HSBC Holdings flagged suspicious transactions in Huawei accounts.

There, she makes $10 an hour cleaning rooms, changing bed sheets, emptying trash cans. It\u2019s dirty work, and it doesn\u2019t cover all her bills, but Jones says she enjoys it. She is grateful to have the job and smiles so much that her colleagues gave her the nickname \u201cSunshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they only knew that yesterday I had to put my last 20 [dollars] in the car [for fuel], and I\u2019m wondering all weekend how I\u2019m going to pay for my daughter\u2019s lunch,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t stress about it because, again, I just pray Lord, if it\u2019s meant for me to have it this week, you\u2019re going to provide for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nJones recently shifted from temporary status to full time, meaning she will soon be eligible for employer-subsidized health insurance. That will save her money every month but even then, her paychecks won\u2019t cover all the expenses she and her teenage daughter have.\n\nAt the same time, Jones makes too much to qualify for government anti-poverty programs, although her daughter is eligible for subsidized health insurance. To afford her monthly car payment, rent, food, gas and utilities, Jones supplements her hospital job by cutting grass and cleaning people\u2019s homes, regularly working from 6:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. She says it would be hard to make it all work if her daughter was young enough to still require child care.\n\n\u201cAll the extra money that you make, you have to hold it. You can\u2019t blow it,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u200bMinimum wage rises\n\nThe lowest-paid Arkansans will enjoy a pay raise Jan. 1 when the minimum wage rises by 50 cents an hour to $9, but Jones will have to wait longer for some relief. Employers will be required by law to pay no less than $10 an hour beginning in 2020 and $11 an hour in 2021.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, a police officer\u2019s starting salary in Arkansas is as low as $11.50 an hour; and an emergency medical technician (EMT) makes less than that. Though still not considered a living wage, which hovers around $15 an hour in Arkansas, it will be much higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\nBecause of the southern state\u2019s relatively low cost of living, the new wage will also be considered one of the highest effective minimum wages anywhere in the United States. By the time it\u2019s fully implemented, it\u2019s expected to affect about 25 percent of the workforce.\n\nThe new law, which was passed through a ballot initiative in early November, received overwhelming support from voters, but some have expressed concern over its implementation. (A ballot initiative is a piece of legislation that is approved or rejected by voters.)\n\n\u201cFor something to go up 30 percent in the next two years is pretty unusual,\u201d said Jeremy Horpedahl, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big cost increase to try and fold into your budget.\u201d\n\nHorpedahl said he expects the effects will be \u201call over the board,\u201d with nonprofit organizations \u201cuniversally impacted.\u201d\n\nAdvocates say that more money in more pockets will stimulate the Arkansan economy. But critics of the initiative, including Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, warned that the potential drawbacks would outweigh the benefits; they say some people may see their employer-sponsored benefits like health insurance reduced or even lose their jobs.\n\nBrent Peterson, co-owner of a restaurant in the state capital of Little Rock, is glad that wages will be rising.\n\nTrio\u2019s Restaurant currently pays all employees more than the required minimum wage, but by 2021, the restaurant will have to figure out how to raise the wage of its lowest earners. To accommodate this, Peterson said, the restaurant will likely increase menu prices, something he didn\u2019t seem too worried about.\n\n\u201cWe raised [prices] about six months ago, and it was only a quarter here or 50 cents here,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThere was no sticker shock with our clientele.\u201d\n\nSome fears\n\nNot everyone has the same confidence that the gaps can be easily closed.\n\n\u201cMaybe it will help our economy, but I can also see where it\u2019s going to hurt a lot of people,\u201d said hair stylist Ashley Holland from the town of Heber Springs, in central Arkansas.\n\nHolland said the wage increase won\u2019t personally affect her, as she already makes more than the minimum wage. In fact, she said she might benefit from attracting more clients, who will be able to afford her prices.\n\nHolland is more concerned with how other local businesses, some already struggling to get by, will manage to pay their employees. For years, storefronts along Main Street have been closing or looking for new tenants, partly because of foot traffic (customers) being redirected to online businesses.\n\n\u201cI can understand a little increase, but I think it\u2019s too much,\u201d Holland said.\n\nJones sympathizes.\n\n\u201cI understand that, too. They can lose out on what they got going on,\u201d she said.\n\nEven when the pay hike takes effect in 2021, it won\u2019t be enough for Jones to walk away from her side gigs. But when it does, she plans to maintain her current budget and put the extra money away for her daughter\u2019s future college expenses.\n\n\u201cAnything is always better, more is always better than less,\u201d Jones said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Prosecutors Expose Trump Hush Money Payments, Russian Contacts", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-expose-trump-hush-money-payments-russian-contacts/4692122.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Court filings Friday from prosecutors in New York and special counsel Robert Mueller laid out why Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, and Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, deserve prison time.\n\nThe filings say Cohen made illegal hush money payments to two women \u2014 Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 ahead of the 2016 election to keep them quiet about their sexual encounters with Trump.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Cohen made the payments in \u201ccoordination with and the direction of\u201d Trump.\n\nThe filings also disclose an attempt by a Russian to wield influence in the campaign.\n\nIn one filing, Mueller details how Cohen spoke to a Russian who \u201cclaimed to be a \u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign \u2018political synergy\u2019 and \u2018synergy on a government level.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia, and Russia has denied any interference in the U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nThe filings also exposed lies told by Manafort during interviews with prosecutors and the FBI.\n\nManafort told \u201cmultiple discernible lies,\u201d the court documents said, including about his communications with a political consultant with alleged ties to Russian intelligence and about interacting with Trump administration officials after Manafort was indicted in 2017.\n\nWhile Trump Tweeted \u201cTotally clears the President.

University Center for Policy Research in New York, told VOA. \"Nikki Haley did not have diplomatic experience, but she did have experience of political negotiation in South Carolina, Nauert doesn't have that sort of background.\"\n\nInfluential role\n\nHaley, who plans to leave her U.N. post by the end of this year, has had an unusually influential and high-profile role as ambassador. During the first year of the Trump administration, she stepped into a void left by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and elevated her profile both domestically and internationally. She has had President Donald Trump's ear and support and became instrumental on important issues, including North Korea, Iran and moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nBut with the arrival of Pompeo and Bolton in the past year, Haley's influence has declined.\n\n\"Haley lost a degree of autonomy when John Bolton became the national security adviser, because he had strong views about the U.N.,\" the International Crisis Group's Pomper noted.\n\nBolton is a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and he famously holds a great deal of disdain for the organization. He once said that if the U.N. building \"lost 10 stories [floors], it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\n\nNauert will also have to carve out her own style of leadership at the U.N. While Haley has been tough in public, \"taking names\" of countries who do not align with U.S. interests, she is by most accounts collegial in private. Nauert, a former Fox News journalist, lacks political or diplomatic experience.\n\n\"The upside is that this could mean a bit less grandstanding for the domestic base,\" said Pomper. \"The downside is that she is likely to have less weight with counterparts, Congress and the president.\"\n\nGuterres 'ready' for U.S. diplomat\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who took office a few weeks before Trump in 2017, told VOA on Friday that \"I cannot make any comments before the Senate confirmation, but I am ready to work very effectively with any ambassador of the United States.\"\n\nThe secretary-general has cultivated a close working relationship with Haley. The United States is the largest single donor to the U.N.'s regular budget, contributing more than $1.2 billion annually, and Haley and Guterres have worked together to implement reforms to make the U.N. more efficient, in part to save U.S. taxpayers money.\n\n\"That process is still ongoing, and Nauert is going to need to work closely with Guterres to make sure these reforms are fulfilled and they do have financial benefits for the U.S.,\" the U.N.

The moon's far side is also known as the dark side because it faces away from Earth and remains comparatively unknown. It has a different composition than sites on the near side, where previous missions have landed.\n\n\n\nIf successful, the mission would propel the Chinese space program to a leading position in one of the most important areas of lunar exploration.\n\n\n\nChina landed its Yutu, or \u201cJade Rabbit,\u201d rover on the moon five years ago and plans to send its Chang'e 5 probe there next year and have it return to Earth with samples \u2014 the first time that will have been done since 1976. A crewed lunar mission is also under consideration.\n\nChang'e 4 is also a lander-rover combination and will explore both above and below the lunar surface after arriving at the South Pole-Aitken basin's Von Karman crater following a 27-day journey.\n\n\n\nIt will also perform radio-astronomical studies that, because the far side always faces away from Earth, will be \u201cfree from interference from our planet's ionosphere, human-made radio frequencies and auroral radiation noise,'' space industry expert Leonard David wrote on the website Space.com.\n\n\n\nIt may also carry plant seeds and silkworm eggs, according to Xinhua.\n\n\n\nChang'e is the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology.\n\n\n\nChina conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, making it only the third country after Russia and the U.S. to do so. It has put a pair of space stations into orbit, one of which is still operating as a precursor to a more than 60-ton station that is due to come online in 2022. The launch of a Mars rover is planned for the mid-2020s.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate communication between controllers on Earth and the Chang'e 4 mission, China in May launched a relay satellite named Queqiao, or \u201cMagpie Bridge,'' after an ancient Chinese folk tale.\n\n\n\nChina's space program has benefited from cooperation with Russia and European nations, although it was excluded from the 420-ton International Space Station, mainly because of U.S. legislation barring such cooperation amid concerns over its strong military connections. Its program also suffered a rare setback last year with the failed launch of its Long March 5 rocket."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "New NASA Lander Captures 1st Sounds of Martian Wind", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/new-nasa-lander-captures-1st-sounds-of-martian-wind/4691708.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "NASA\u2019s new Mars lander has captured the first sounds of the \u201creally unworldly\u201d Martian wind.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory released audio clips of the alien wind Friday.

Such back doors are unlikely to remain secret, meaning that hackers and criminals could easily exploit them.\n\n\n\nBack doors were central to a 1990s U.S. effort to require manufacturers to install a so-called \"Clipper chip\" into communications equipment so the government could listen in on voice and data transmissions. U.S. law enforcement officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, are again pushing for legislation that would somehow give authorities access to secure communications.\n\n\n\nThe Australian bill is seen by many as a beachhead for those efforts because the nation belongs to the \"Five Eyes'' security alliance with the U.S., Britain, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\"There is a lot here that doesn't make any sense,'' Schneier said of the Australian bill. \"This is a technological law written by non-technologists and it's not just bad policy. In many ways, I think it's unworkable.''\n\n\n\nA leading figure in cryptography, Martin Hellman of Stanford University, said it appears the bill would \"facilitate crime by weakening the security of the affected devices.''\n\nBlow against 'evil work'\n\n\n\nThe law won final legislative approval late Thursday, parliament's final session of the year. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\"This was very important legislation to give police and security agencies the ability to get into encrypted communications,'' he told Nine Network television. \"Things like WhatsApp, things like that which are used by terrorists and organized criminals and indeed pedophile rings to do their evil work.''\n\n\n\nHe noted that the opposition Labor Party \"had to be dragged to the table'' and backed the legislation as an emergency measure out of concern extremists could target Christmas-New Year crowds.\n\n\n\nLabor lawmakers said they want amendments passed when parliament resumes in February. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said he supported the current bill only because he could not \"expose Australians to increased [national security] risk.''\n\n\n\nDuncan Lewis, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, noted during hearings that extremists share encrypted messages that Australia's main secret service cannot intercept or read.\n\n\n\nPresident Morry Bailles of the Law Council of Australia, a leading lawyers group, criticized the bill's swift parliamentary journey though lawmakers knew \"serious problems exist'' with giving law enforcement \"unprecedented powers to access encrypted communications.''\n\n\n\nAustralian law enforcement officials have complained that the growth of end-to-end encryption in applications such as Signal, Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger and Apple's iMessage could be the worst blow to intelligence and law enforcement capability in decades. Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said it hampers criminal investigations at all levels.\n\nApple argument\n\n\n\nBut Apple, in comments filed with parliament in October, argued that \"it would be wrong to weaken security for millions of law-abiding customers in order to investigate the very few who pose a threat.''\n\n\n\nThe company's iPhones, because of their strong encryption, are bulwarks of national security around the globe and help protect journalists, human rights workers and people living under repressive regimes.\n\n\n\n\"The iPhone is national security infrastructure right now,'' said Schneier. \"Every Australian legislator uses the systems and devices that that law will target, and making them insecure seems like a really bad idea.''\n\n\n\nApple also complained in October that the bill was \"dangerously ambiguous.''\n\n\n\nOne apparent contradiction confounds technologists. The legislation says the government \"must not require providers to implement or build systemic weaknesses in forms of electronic protection ('back doors')'' but also says it can \"require the selective deployment of a weakness or vulnerability in a particular service, device or item of software on a case-by-case basis.''\n\n\n\nTechnologists say that the mathematics underlying encryption and the way it\u2019s encoded into software make it impossible to decrypt a single user's communications without affecting all users.\n\n\n\nEric Wenger, director of cybersecurity and privacy policy for the U.S. technology giant Cisco Systems, warned during debate on the bill that Australia could be at a competitive disadvantage if its data were not regarded as secure.\n\n\n\nAustralia was a major driver of a statement agreed to at the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Germany last year that called on the technology industry to provide \"lawful and non-arbitrary access to available information'' needed to protect against terrorist threats."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Virginia Tech Students Unveil the House of the Future", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-tech-students-unveil-the-house-of-the-future/4689083.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Joseph Wheeler and his team of students and faculty from Virginia Tech University are convinced they are building the house of the future.\n\nJudges at the recent Solar Decathlon Middle East agreed, awarding their future house first place in the December competition held in Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe set it up in two days,\u201d Wheeler told VOA. \u201cAll the other teams took the full two weeks of construction.

Yet while the country is scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019, Britain is as divided over the issue as it ever has been.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has agreed the terms of the \u2018divorce\u2019 with the leaders of the EU\u2019s remaining member states, but lawmakers in the British parliament still have to approve the so-called Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nIn ordinary times, a Conservative government with a simple majority would be able to get the deal through the House of Commons with little fuss.\n\nBut these are extraordinary times. May cannot rely on the support from members of parliament in her own party \u2013 much less Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been propping up May\u2019s minority government since her disastrous general election last year.\n\nPress Association Will Theresa May quit? Could Jeremy Corbyn become Prime Minister?\n\nAs it stands, as May bizarrely takes her Brexit plan around the country as if on the election trail, no commentator in the country expects the prime minister to get enough support when MPs vote on December 11. The only question, it seems, is how heavily she is defeated.\n\nThen what? That\u2019s where things get more unpredictable, with the outcomes ranging wildly from the prospect of another general election to no Brexit at all.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to what will be a historic week in British politics, however it ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nOn Tuesday, MPs began five days of debates ahead of what is described as the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement they are debating outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. The vote is expected on December 11, but even that isn\u2019t set in stone. Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\n\nWill May get enough votes?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSome 20 Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against May\u2019s deal, 45 have said they will not vote in favour and more than 20 have said they are unhappy with it. Their unease comes from, as they see it, the agreement aligning the UK too closely with the EU, and they claim May is set to deliver a Brexit in name only.\n\nGiven that May doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament, she will be relying on support from opposition parties. May\u2019s minority government ally, the DUP, who usually vote with the government to help them pass legislation, has also expressed its own concerns with how the deal risks separating the island of Ireland from the mainland as a trading territory.\n\nThe Labour Party, the official opposition, has also declined to approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the have concerns about the impact on jobs and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe bottom line is this: the chance of the deal being approved with the simple majority of 320 of the 639 MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat are the amendments?\n\nThe vote - or votes - may not be limited to the terms of May\u2019s deal. Labour has tabled an amendment outlining how MPs will \u201cpursue every option\u201d that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of May\u2019s deal or leaving without any deal at all.\n\nTory and Labour backbenchers have also put forward something similar, and there appears to be united front against the UK quitting the EU without any deal - or what is colloquially referred to as \u2018crashing out\u2019.\n\nIndeed, on the first day of debates, MPs voted for a motion that means if May\u2019s Brexit is voted down next week, MPs can effectively instruct ministers on what to do next and amend her \u201cplan B\u201d option.\n\nPress Association\n\nWhat happens if she wins the vote?\n\nIn the unlikely event that scores of MPs from across the political spectrum swing behind the embattled prime minister, it will allow the government to introduce the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to the Commons either before Christmas or after recess (the holiday for parliament), in January.\n\nWhile no guarantee of the legislation passing, it would suggest an orderly procession towards the EU exit doors.\n\nWhat happens if she loses the vote?\n\nYou would expect Theresa May\u2019s premiership to be over, right? While that\u2019s a likely outcome, it is not the only one. These are the most likely scenarios.\n\n\u2013 She could try again\n\nThis would depend on the margin of her defeat.\n\nThe European Union has been adamant this is a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 deal that cannot be renegotiated. But if faced with the threat of a calamitous no-deal Brexit and following a narrow Commons defeat, May might fancy testing their resolve and seeing if she can get at least some cosmetic changes to appease enough MPs to win a second vote.\n\n\u2013 Theresa May quits\n\nMay herself has been adamant that she will stay on as prime minister regardless of the result. But a defeat by something in the order of 200 votes - which would represent a rebellion by scores of her own MPs - and it could be the most elegant way out.\n\n\u2013 May forced out by a Conservative rebellion\n\nConservative MPs most strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal have already failed to oust May, struggling to muster enough support to trigger a leadership battle two weeks ago. But once the vote is over, other disgruntled Tory politicians could make their move.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum\n\nYes, taking the deal to the public is an option. May has ruled it out, and Labour has backed the idea - but only if they do not get a general election. It would possibly require an extension to the two-year timeframe to agree a Brexit deal, but even a senior Conservative has suggested another referendum could logistically be held by the end of May (the month, that is).\n\n\u2013 May calls another general election\n\nThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass. The Prime Minister could hope that voters will - via the ballot box - back her plan. Her fellow Conservatives are anxious to avoid this route after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament and a resurgent Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 Labour tries to force an election"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Migrants Don't Pose A Threat To Public Health.

The number of refugees and people fleeing violence or natural disasters has skyrocketed this year, and the topic has become a political hot point through Europe and the United States.\n\nBut these immigrant populations are beneficial to rich nations, the authors found, often traveling for an education or working in roles that contribute to local economies. In Britain, for example, 37 percent of doctors work with medical qualifications they received in another country.\n\n\u201cIn too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda,\u201d Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, said in a statement. \u201cMigrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come.

Anderson was given credit for the 22 years he\u2019s already served.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely ready for this whole fiasco to be over with,\u201d Anderson told the Daily Commercial. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to my brothers and they tell me \u2026 at least you\u2019ll be able to come home.\u201d\n\nUntil Monday, Anderson was serving a sentence of life without parole for his part in the savage murders of 49-year-old Richard Wendorf and his wife, 54-year-old Ruth Wendorf.\n\nBecause he was 17 when the crimes were committed, Anderson became eligible for resentencing when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2016 that juveniles who had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole were entitled to new sentencing hearings.\n\nWPSD-TV via ASSOCIATED PRESS This image from a Nov. 29, 1996, broadcast on WPSD-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, shows the teens arrested in connection with the slayings of Richard and Ruth Wendorf.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson was a member of the so-called Vampire Clan in the rural town of Murray, Kentucky. The group was led by Anderson\u2019s co-defendant, Rod Ferrell, who was 16 at the time of the slayings.\n\nRuth Wendorf\u2019s relatives attended Anderson\u2019s re-sentencing hearing and did not oppose his early release. Speaking with the Daily Commercial, they said they are more concerned about Ferrell, who will face his own re-sentencing hearing in July.\n\n\u201cWe just want Ferrell,\u201d said Ruth Wendorf\u2019s daughter, Paula Queen Lohse.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one we\u2019re waiting for,\u201d added her sister, Lillian Rapp. \u201cHe\u2019s very arrogant. He\u2019s never apologized.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Orlando Sentinel, Ferrell was the ringleader of the cult and was obsessed with the role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. At the time of his arrest, he claimed he was a 500-year-old vampire named Vesago\ufeff and told authorities his followers referred to him as \u201cmaker.\u201d Ferrell said the group participated in ritualistic ceremonies and bloodletting rituals.\n\n\u201cI tried to embrace the lifestyle of being a vampire and being so young, my mind latched onto it so deeply, so tenaciously, that I got lost inside it,\u201d Ferrell told Crime Watch Daily in April 2016.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Rod Ferrell taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nIn November 1996, Ferrell, Anderson and two girls, Charity Keesee, 16, and Dana Cooper, 19, traveled from western Kentucky to Eustis, Florida, about 35 miles northwest of Orlando, to pick up 15-year-old Heather Wendorf. Ferrell had met Wendorf a year earlier and wanted to induct her into his cult, police said.\n\nWhen the group arrived in Florida, they met with Wendorf, whom Ferrell later claimed was initiated into the cult by participating in \u201ccrossing over\u201d ceremony.\n\nFerrell and Anderson planned to break into Wendorf\u2019s parents\u2019 house and steal the keys to their 1993 Ford Explorer. However, the plan apparently changed along the way to include killing Richard and Ruth Wendorf. Ferrell and Anderson, police said, entered the Wendorf home alone on Nov. 25, 1996.\n\nRichard and Ruth Wendorf\u2019s other daughter, Jennifer, then 17, discovered the bodies later that night and called police.\n\nAl Gussler, then a detective with the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office, was the first officer on the scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything worse,\u201d Gussler told Crime Watch Daily. \u201cIt was a very gruesome situation. That was probably the worst case I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nThe cult fled Florida in the Wendorfs\u2019 vehicle but didn\u2019t stay on the run long. On Thanksgiving Day 1996, they were picked up by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Ferrell waived his Miranda rights and admitted killing the couple with a crowbar.\n\n\u201cI went to her dad and smacked the fuck out of him until he finally quit breathing, so, yes, I\u2019m admitting to murder,\u201d police said Ferrell told them. \u201cActually, it took him about 20 fucking minutes to stop. I swear, I thought he was immortal or something.\u201d\n\nFerrell told detectives he used a crowbar because a \u201cmachete or chainsaw\u201d would\u2019ve been \u201ctoo messy.\u201d\n\nRuth Wendorf, the self-proclaimed cult leader explained, walked out of a bathroom after her husband was killed and saw him holding the bloody murder weapon. She was holding a hot cup of coffee and threw the liquid in Ferrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when she lunged at me, \u2019cause I was actually going to let her live, but after she lunged at me, I just took the bottom of the crowbar and kept stabbing it through her skull,\u201d Ferrell said.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Charity Keesee that was taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nAnderson also spoke with police. He admitted being at the crime scene and suggested the homicides had been premeditated.\n\n\u201cI was going to go for the father, and he was going to go for the mother, but when I saw him make the first blow, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nWhen details of the horrific murders were made public, the media dubbed them the Vampire Cult Killings. The nickname was widely reported, much to the consternation of the defense attorneys, who failed to persuade reporters to refer to it as \u201cthe Wendorf case,\u201d the Orlando Sentinel reported.\n\nA grand jury in Lake County indicted Ferrell, Anderson, Keesee and Cooper in December 1996. The grand jury declined to indict Heather Wendorf.\n\nIn February 1998, Ferrell, then 17, pleaded guilty to two counts of felony murder and was sentenced to death. At the time, he was the youngest person on death row in the United States.\n\nAnderson was given his life sentence after pleading guilty to being a principal to first-degree murder.\n\nKeesee was convicted of two counts of third-degree murder and sentenced to 10 years behind bars. Cooper, who was convicted of the same charges, received a 17-year sentence. Both women have since been released.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections An undated photo of Dana Cooper that was taken by the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nFerrell remained on death row until 2000, when the Florida Supreme Court reduced his sentence to life in prison.\n\nDuring his interview with Crime Watch Daily, Ferrell said he expects his sentence will be commuted to either time served or a specific number of years.\n\n\u201cI have a woman [and] I have a job waiting on me,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cI even have a cat and dog waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office \u2015 the agency representing the state in the resentencing hearings \u2015 did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nRetired detective Gussler said he does not believe Ferrell should ever be released.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give a second chance to the brutal murder of the mother and father, so, no, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he could stay there for life,\u201d Gussler told Crime Watch Daily. \u201cAnd if I lived in the area he was getting out in, I would definitely keep an eye out on him.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Cardi B Learned She Was Nominated For Grammys While Leaving Court", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cardi-b-grammy-nominations-courtroom_us_5c0af125e4b0a606a9a8acd8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Cardi B will never forget where she was when learned she\u2019d been nominated for five Grammy awards \u2015 but she\u2019d probably like to.\n\nThe rapper found out about the nominations on Friday while walking out of a New York City courthouse outfitted in a fur-collared coat, a suede hat and large sunglasses, according to NBC News.\n\nCardi B was in court to answer for her arraignment hearing on misdemeanor charges relating to an August incident where she allegedly ordered an assault on two bartenders employed at a New York strip club.\n\nAt the hearing, the judge ordered Cardi B to stay away from the two women, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAs Cardi B left the courthouse, a reporter asked her how it felt to be nominated, according to NBC News.\n\n\u201cI am?\u201d the rapper responded. \u201cHow many nominations?\u201d\n\nAfter she learned the total number, the entertainer screamed excitedly.\n\nStill, the moment wasn\u2019t how she imagined, she later confessed on Twitter.\n\nThis is not How expected to find out I\u2019m nominated for a Grammy \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02I need a do over \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude29 pic.twitter.com/aCt5WH6ZwZ \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 7, 2018"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Here Are The Most Interesting Parts Of The Latest Mueller Filings", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-are-new-key-pieces-of-information-in-the-russia-investigation_us_5c0b03a3e4b035a7bf5b3a27", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Ann Heisenfelt via Getty Images Special counsel Robert Mueller said lawyer Michael Cohen acted at the direction of President Donald Trump.\n\nThree documents filed in court Friday revealed new details in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe documents pertained to the government\u2019s cooperation agreement with Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, as well as Mueller\u2019s assessment of why former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort breached his plea deal with investigators.\n\nThe special counsel said in a memo to a federal judge that Manafort lied to investigators in the special counsel\u2019s office about his contacts with administration officials, among other things.\n\nMueller\u2019s filing on Cohen outlined how the attorney assisted the special counsel\u2019s office by providing \u201cinformation about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign\u201d as well as details on the Trump Organization\u2019s real estate plans in Russia. Cohen also admitted to making hush-money payments to two women at the direction of Trump.\n\nIn another filing Friday, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York submitted a sentencing memo for Cohen recommending he served 42 months.\n\nAll three court filings provide new insight into where the special counsel\u2019s investigation currently stands. Here are some of the most interesting tidbits.\n\nMueller\u2019s Memo On Manafort\n\nManafort told \u201cmultiple discernible lies,\u201d Mueller\u2019s team said. \u201cThese were not instances of mere memory lapses.\u201d\n\nManafort allegedly told five main lies to the special counsel and the FBI.\n\nManafort's five alleged lies.\n\nThe alleged lies pertained to Manafort\u2019s interactions with suspected Russian spy Konstantin Kilimnik, his contacts with Trump administration officials and a transfer of funds to a firm working for Manafort.\n\nManafort allegedly texted with someone authorizing that person to talk to an administration official on his behalf.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that Manafort had contacts with Administration officials. For instance, in a text exchange from May 26, 2018, Manafort authorized a person to speak with an Administration official on Manafort's behalf. Special counsel's office\n\nThe memo also referenced \u201cinformation pertinent to another Department of Justice investigation.\u201d\n\nPortions of the memo are heavily redacted, specifically in the section on Kilimnik.\n\nSpecial counsel's office Portions about Manafort's interactions with Kilimnik are heavily redacted.\n\nThe Southern District Of New York\u2019s Memo On Cohen\n\nCohen acted \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of Trump\u201d to influence the 2016 presidential election, according to the memo.\n\nHis efforts included payments to allegedly silence Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York Prosecutors plainly state that Cohen acted at the direction of Trump.\n\nCohen sought reimbursements, which were illegally disguised, for orchestrating the payments to McDougal and Daniels, who claimed they had affairs with Trump about a decade earlier. McDougal and Daniels are referenced in the memo as Woman-1 and Woman-2, respectively.\n\nProsecutors claimed the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of Cohen\u2019s payments to McDougal was to \u201cprevent [her] story from influencing the election.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say Cohen saw himself as the \u201cultimate fixer\u201d for Trump, adding that he arranged the payments to the women \u201cto increase his power and influence.\u201d\n\nThis was not a blind act of loyalty, as Cohen has also suggested. His actions suggest that Cohen relished the status of ultimate fixer \u2013 a role that he embraced as recently as May 2018. Cohen was driven by a desire to further ingratiate himself with a potential future President ... and arranged for the payments in an attempt to increase his power and influence. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\n\nThe New York prosecutors rejected the idea that Cohen should receive leniency for helping investigators, noting that his crimes were motivated by \u201cpersonal greed\u201d and that he \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Cohen\u2019s cooperation with investigators \u201cdoes not make him a hero.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York New York prosecutors suggested a \"substantial term of imprisonment\" for Cohen.\n\nMueller\u2019s Memo On Cohen\n\nCohen has provided the special counsel\u2019s office with information about the Trump Organization\u2019s so-called \u201cMoscow Project,\u201d including who was involved in the discussions and contacts with Russian government officials.\n\n\n\nCohen also said he discussed the \u201cMoscow Project\u201d with Trump, who is referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d throughout the memo, \u201cwell into\u201d his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nSpecial counsel's office Mueller noted that Cohen's alleged discussions of the Moscow Project with Trump were especially concerning considering Russia's attempts to interfere with the election.\n\nA Russian national who claimed to be politically influential in Russia contacted Cohen in 2015, according to Mueller\u2019s memo. That person offered the Trump campaign \u201cpolitical synergy\u201d and \u201csynergy on a government level.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat same Russian national also repeatedly proposed to Cohen a meeting between Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin. Cohen, however, never followed through with the invitation.\n\nThe person told Cohen that such a meeting could have a 'phenomenal' impact 'not only in political but in a business dimension as well,' referring to the Moscow Project, because there is 'no bigger warranty in any project than consent of [the President of Russia]. Special counsel Robert Mueller\n\nMueller is investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s real estate plans in Russia as part of the bigger investigation.\n\n\n\nThe special counsel is also looking into people who were connected to the White House in 2017 and 2018, which overlaps with Trump\u2019s presidency."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Says He Is 'Totally' Cleared Following Michael Cohen Sentencing Recommendations", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-convinced-he-is-totally-cleared-following-michael-cohen-sentencing-recommendations_us_5c0afce2e4b035a7bf5b368f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Friday after two different sentencing recommendations were announced for his former personal attorney, creating his own interpretation of how the law works.\n\n\u201cTotally clears the President.

The court document also outlined how Cohen assisted the special counsel\u2019s office, including by providing \u201cinformation about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign\u201d and details on the Trump Organization\u2019s real estate plans in Russia.\n\nCohen also told Mueller\u2019s team that he was in contact with a Russian national who claimed to be politically influential and offered to help the Trump campaign make inroads with the Kremlin, according to the filing.\n\nBut the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York\u2019s filing rejected the idea that Cohen should receive leniency for his assistance, stating that Cohen had a \u201crose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen\u2019s decision to plead guilty \u2013 rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes \u2013 does not make him a hero,\u201d prosecutors said in the filing.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty last week to lying to Congress.\n\nCohen worked for the Trump organization for over a decade and spent years as Trump\u2019s go-to fixer, helping negotiate international real estate deals and threatening journalists pursuing stories that would hurt his boss. He became a central figure in the Mueller investigation after the FBI raided his law office, home and hotel room in April this year.\n\nMonths after the raid, Cohen pleaded guilty to two criminal counts related to paying women to keep quiet about alleged sexual affairs with Trump. Cohen told a Manhattan court in August that, at Trump\u2019s direction, he had paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in hush money through a shell company during the 2016 election campaign. Federal prosecutors also included in their filing on Friday that Trump had directed Cohen to make the payments.\n\nLast week, Cohen accepted a plea deal in a separate case and admitted that he\u2019d lied to Congress about the extent of the Trump Organization\u2019s planned real estate development in Moscow. Cohen had told two congressional committees last year that negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow ended in January 2016, but court documents revealed that the talks lasted \u201cas late as approximately June 2016\u201d \u2015 while Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nCohen\u2019s pre-sentencing filings on Friday are part of an intense week in the Mueller probe, and come the same day as the special counsel\u2019s office outlines how Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort broke his plea deal by lying to investigators. On Tuesday, Mueller also filed two memos recommending that former national security adviser Michael Flynn serve no jail time as a result of his extensive cooperation with the probe.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has continuously tried to distance himself from Cohen and accused his former attorney of lying to protect himself.

The documents described two previously unknown instances of Russians reaching out to Trump\u2019s inner circle. One of the memos that was written by federal prosecutors in Manhattan also accused Cohen of not fully cooperating with the government and suggested he serve \u201ca substantial term of imprisonment.\u201d\n\nCohen spent over a decade as an executive at Trump\u2019s real estate company. After Trump took office last year, Cohen served as his personal attorney. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations stemming from payments he made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. As part of his plea, Cohen admitted those payments were designed to suppress their stories during the election and said they were directed by Trump.\n\nIn their memo, the federal prosecutors state for the first time that they believe Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction\u201d of Trump when he made the payments.\n\nFriday\u2019s memos come on the heels of a sentencing recommendation filed last week by Cohen\u2019s attorneys. In their memo, Cohen\u2019s lawyers argued he should receive a sentence that does not include prison time beyond the hours he spent in jail during his trial. According to Cohen\u2019s attorneys, he deserves leniency because he has voluntarily cooperated with an array of investigations, including special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump Foundation and a mysterious, separate \u201copen inquiry,\u201d and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.\n\nAccording to Cohen\u2019s attorneys, he \u201crespectfully declined\u201d to obtain a standard cooperation agreement, which would have been expansive in scope, from prosecutors because he feared it would cause his legal battle to drag on and he was eager to begin rebuilding his life.\n\nHowever, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan painted a different picture in their memo and argued Cohen did not obtain a cooperation agreement because he was unwilling to \u201cundergo full debriefings that encompass [Cohen\u2019s] entire criminal history, as well as any and all information they possess about crimes committed by both themselves and others.\u201d Many of the charges against Cohen stem from his personal finances, which includes real estate holdings and a taxi business that is linked to a partner with a criminal record.\n\nAccording to the prosecutors, Cohen provided \u201csignificant\u201d assistance to Mueller, but was less helpful regarding \u201cmatters relating to ongoing investigations\u201d being carried out by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cHad Cohen actually cooperated, it could have been fruitful,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen\u2019s work with Mueller \u201cmerits credit,\u201d but they felt he did not fully cooperate with their office, and asked the judge to only grant a \u201cmodest\u201d reduction from the recommended sentence for his crimes, which is 51 to 63 months.\n\nCohen\u2019s lead attorney, Guy Petrillo, declined to comment on record about the prosecutors\u2019 claim that Cohen did not fully cooperate.\n\nMueller also filed a memo on Friday that noted he charged Cohen with making false statements to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. In his memo, Mueller said Cohen had \u201cgone to significant lengths\u201d to assist the probe about whether Trump\u2019s campaign cooperated with Russia in its effort to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFor his part, Mueller said he \u201cdoes not take a position with respect to a particular sentence to be imposed\u201d other than calling for Cohen\u2019s sentence for lying to Congress to be served concurrently with the penalties for other charges, which means he will not spend extra time in prison beyond his sentence in New York.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team did not respond to a request for comment about Cohen\u2019s case. The president has previously blasted Cohen as a \u201cweak person\u201d and accused his former ally of lying to obtain a reduced sentence. Trump has repeatedly dismissed Mueller\u2019s probe as a partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and insisted there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between his campaign team and Russia. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement attacking Cohen and dismissing the prosecutors\u2019 memos as insignificant.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s filings in Mr. Cohen\u2019s case tell us nothing of value that wasn\u2019t already known. Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied, and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nCohen did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMueller\u2019s memo also revealed multiple instances of previously undisclosed contact between Cohen and Russians who were interested in connecting Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Mueller, Cohen claimed Trump was also interested in meeting with Putin.\n\nMueller wrote that Cohen said he \u201cconferred\u201d with Trump during the campaign about reaching out to the Kremlin to gauge interest in a meeting with Putin. Mueller also wrote that, \u201cin or around November 2015,\u201d Cohen communicated with a \u201cRussian national who claimed to be a \u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign \u2018political synergy\u2019 and \u2018synergy on a government level.\u2019\u201d According to Mueller, Cohen said this person also proposed a meeting between Trump and Putin.\n\n\u201cThe person told Cohen that such a meeting could have a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 impact \u2018not only in political but in a business dimension as well,\u2019 referring to the Moscow project,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nTrump and Putin ultimately did not meet until after Trump took office.\n\nThe memo from the federal prosecutors in Manhattan also contained interesting comments Cohen made in conversations he taped that were later obtained by investigators in raids on his home and office. According to the prosecutors, Cohen \u201cpublicly and privately took credit\u201d for Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical success\u201d including one discussion where he claimed that he \u201cstarted the whole campaign.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutors also included snippets from two private conversations Cohen recorded that were designed to show he was \u201cthreatening and abusive when he wanted to get his way.\u201d This was meant to challenge Cohen\u2019s attorneys\u2019 characterization of him as a person of great \u201cfortitude and fundamental character\u201d in their memo calling for leniency.\n\nIn one of those recorded conversations, Cohen was talking with bankers as he sought to renegotiate a loan, and he vowed to teach the bank \u201ca lesson they\u2019ve never seen before in their life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna hit everybody up with a lawsuit that\u2019s gonna spin everyone\u2019s head. And I\u2019m looking forward to that, by the way,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying it as a threat. It\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n_____"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Dwyane Wade Slams Critics Saying Gabrielle Union Was Acting Like She Gave Birth", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gabrielle-union-dwayne-wade-baby-controversy_us_5c0ae35ae4b035a7bf5b16e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "In an interview with Oprah Winfrey set to air Dec. 8, actress Gabrielle Union and her husband, NBA star Dwyane Wade, shared how hurt they were when, after the birth of their daughter in November, commenters online ridiculed Union for posting photos of herself practicing what\u2019s known as skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care.\n\nThe set of two photos, which she shared on Instagram on Nov. 8, show Union and Wade holding their baby, Kaavia James, who was carried by a surrogate.\n\n\u201cI think for me the most hurtful thing was once we had our baby and everybody started talking about \u2018Why is she in the bed holding the baby? Why she got a gown on? Why she acting like she just had a baby?\u2019\u201d said Wade. \u201cAnd once again, people are uneducated on the process and why we decided to go skin to skin as soon as our baby came out.\u201d\n\nIn skin-to-skin contact, parents hold their naked baby to their chest against their bare skin. Research shows that this kind of embrace soon after birth helps calm and soothe the baby; regulate the infant\u2019s temperature, heart rate and breathing; improve the blood glucose levels in newborns; and lower pain levels in babies. It can also help babies sleep better and give parents and child a chance to bond emotionally. And those benefits are especially crucial for babies born prematurely.\n\nFor parents like Wade and Union, who needed the help of a surrogate, the skin-to-skin contact takes on additional importance, said Dr. Shannon M. Clark, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and an associate professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who was not involved in the pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe importance of skin to skin for intended parents is that the immediate benefits that can happen with the mom who just gave birth to her baby would be the same for an intended parent who didn\u2019t give birth to a baby,\u201d said Clark. \u201cBeing able to do that as an intended parent \u2015 it\u2019s ideal.\u201d\n\nShe bristled at the accusation that Union was acting as though she just gave birth, noting that wearing a hospital gown with an open front is the easiest way to accomplish skin-to-skin contact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone who does that is trying to pretend that they gave birth,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s just for ease of use and ease of access in order to facilitate adequate skin to skin.\u201d\n\nUnion, who was diagnosed with adenomyosis, suffered eight or nine pregnancy losses (she lost count) before deciding to use a surrogate.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the couple entered into a traditional surrogacy, in which the woman who carries the pregnancy uses her egg to conceive the child, or a gestational surrogacy, in which the gestational carrier is pregnant with the intended parents\u2019 embryo.\n\n\u201cSometimes people use donor sperm. Sometimes people use donor eggs. Sometimes it is the couple\u2019s own embryo,\u201d Union explained in another part of the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s all different kinds of routes to that. Whether the couple opts to share that with you should be on them.\u201d\n\nKaavia James was born Nov. 7.\n\nDr. Lisa Erickson, a retired reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist in Minnesota who has experience helping people build their family through surrogacy, said skin-to-skin contact is one of several ways that intended parents can bond with their baby.\n\n\u201cSome [intended parents] can be present at delivery, [and] some cannot,\u201d she said. \u201cKangaroo care is just one method to feel the experience of closeness.\u201d\n\nErickson said the bonding between intended parents and child can start even before birth, with the intended parents and the surrogate bonding with each other. For instance, she said, it isn\u2019t uncommon for the surrogate to keep a journal throughout the pregnancy and give that diary to the intended parents.\n\nClark mentioned that additional kinds of bonding can help intended parents bond with their baby during pregnancy, for example, by attending prenatal checkups to keep updated on milestones and letting the surrogate know what music and children\u2019s books the family plans to share with the baby so that the surrogate can begin listening and reading out loud to the fetus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit different for every couple and for every matched intended parent and a [surrogate], but there are ways to facilitate the bonding,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the hope is that once the baby is here, skin to skin, being involved with the labor and delivery process and being there for the surrogate or gestational carrier is the most important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to build a family, and this is just one of them,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift of unmeasurable love.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Could Prescription Heroin Help Stem Opioid Deaths In The U.S.?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prescription-heroin-opioid-deaths_us_5c0809bae4b0844cda4f5196", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Yahoo Canada News A tray of supplies at the Insite supervised injection clinic in Vancouver, Canada, where people are permitted to inject illicit drugs in the presence of medical staff.\n\nAs drug overdose deaths in the United States soar and life expectancy drops, researchers are looking to unconventional approaches to help stem the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u2015 including making heroin available by prescription.\n\nA report released by the nonprofit Rand Corporation this week analyzed the literature on two interventions \u2015 prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites \u2015 that already exist in Europe, Canada and Australia, but are still highly controversial in the United States.\n\nWhile prescribing one of the drugs at the center of the opioid crisis might seem unthinkable to the uninitiated, Beau Kilmer, lead author of the new report and the co-director of Rand\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center, explained that it can be an effective way to keep drug users safe if traditional treatments haven\u2019t worked for them.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just legalizing heroin or giving it out,\u201d he said, stressing that prescription heroin isn\u2019t a first-line treatment. Instead, heroin-assisted therapy involves offering pharmaceutical-grade heroin to people who have tried other treatments, such as methadone, and continued to inject. That dose of heroin would be used under medical supervision in a clinic, often with the option of taking methadone home to ward off potential withdrawal.\n\nThe researchers analyzed randomized controlled trials on prescription heroin in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and found strong evidence to support that drug users who were prescribed heroin were less likely to use illicit street heroin. Unlike prescription heroin, street heroin carries the risk of being adulterated with other substances, such as fentanyl, the highly potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the nearly 50,000 opioid deaths the U.S. logged in 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that people who received prescription heroin had better social and mental health outcomes and were less likely to engage in criminal activity than those who received methadone.\n\n\u201cFor these individuals, not only does it reduce their use of street-source heroin, but it also helps stabilize their lives,\u201d said Kilmer, who explained many people who have been using drugs for an extended period of time spend a significant portion of the day trying to get money to pay for heroin, potentially putting themselves in dangerous situations.\n\nThe report concluded that it\u2019s time for the U.S. to pilot prescription heroin.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of these programs in other countries, and given where we are in the United States with fentanyl poisoning, we definitely think that there should be randomized controlled trials of heroin-assisted treatment in the United States,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nThe new report found less robust evidence behind supervised consumption sites \u2015 where people bring their own street drugs to inject, using clean supplies in a hygienic clinical setting under medical supervision.\n\nAlthough previous research on existing supervised consumption sites outside of the U.S. found that these sites reduced disease transmission and drove down emergency calls and fatal overdoses, the new report concluded that there were too few studies, from a limited number of locations, to draw rigorous conclusions from.\n\nOn the other hand, Kilmer pointed out that those supervised consumption sites have been in existence for between 15 and 30 years, and have withstood multiple changes in national and local government. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sites are effective, but it does suggest that if they have negative effects, they\u2019re minor ones.\n\n\u201cIf there really was a significant downside for the individuals or the communities, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have such longevity,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nCultural and legal obstacles stand in the way.\n\nHeroin is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning there\u2019s no accepted medical use for it and doctors can\u2019t prescribe it. Human research on Schedule I drugs is permitted, but similar to the obstacles medical marijuana researchers run up against, prescription heroin researchers would encounter barriers, such as having to get research approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe new report suggests a workaround. It would be easier to start a pilot program on injectable hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid used for pain in the United States. There\u2019s less research on injectable hydromorphone than there is on prescription heroin. Still, the limited research that does exist suggests that like prescription heroin, supervised injectable hydromorphone could have physical and mental health benefits and reduce illicit street drug use, potentially making it a viable \u2015 and less stigmatized \u2015 alternative to prescription heroin, with far fewer regulatory hoops.\n\n\u201cThis is a drug already being widely used [in medical settings] in the U.S., so would be simply an incremental adjustment,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. (Although Beletsky was not involved in the report, he did give the authors feedback on it.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more realistic to call for that approach,\u201d he added.\n\nSupervised consumption pilot sites face their own legal obstacles. Although the sites are being considered in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, a federal law known as the \u201ccrack house statute\u201d makes it illegal to use or distribute a controlled substance, and the Justice Department has threatened to crack down on any site that does open.\n\nI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s. Robert Heimer, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health\n\nMany jurisdictions seem skittish about the potential pilots. In October, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation that would have authorized the nation\u2019s first pilot program in San Francisco, although it remains to be seen what will happen when Democratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is sworn in next year.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s, and take some risks,\u201d said Robert Heimer, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.\n\n\u201cThese are as much practical implementations as they are scientific. Sometimes waiting for the science to provide conclusive evidence of anything really means missed opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no compelling evidence against, and there\u2019s logical reasons why these things might be expected to work, then just go with it,\u201d Heimer added.\n\nBut prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites were never intended to work in isolation. Instead, they are potential pieces of a much larger, multipronged approach to addressing the crisis.\n\nWhile a handful of big cities eye supervised consumption sites as an additional tool in their opioid crisis toolbox, much of the country lacks more basic harm reduction services. There are still few needle exchange programs in the U.S., particularly in rural areas of the country, and large gaps in access to addiction treatment.\n\nAs it stands, only 12 percent of people with substance use disorder received speciality treatment, according to a 2016 surgeon general report, despite decades of evidence showing that treatments like methadone and buprenorphine are effective. And even less controversial harm reduction strategies, like needle exchanges and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, still aren\u2019t as widely available as they should be.\n\n\u201cRural counties are at high risk for problems,\u201d but they need more fundamental harm reduction strategies in place before trying to create supervised consumption sites, Heimer said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the cities that are more practical first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasing access to methadone and buprenorphine must remain a top priority,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cIf you are talking about places that don\u2019t have methadone or don\u2019t have syringe exchange programs, I don\u2019t think it would make much sense to argue for these other types of interventions, which could be even more controversial.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Man Coughed Up Rare Blood Clot That Is The Exact Shape Of Lung Passage", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/man-coughed-up-a-blood-clot-that-is-the-exact-shape-of-lung-passage_us_5c0aad2de4b0ab8cf69306c3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Doctors are bewildered as to how an extraordinarily shaped blood clot came out of a patient.\n\nGavitt Woodard/The New England Journal of Medicine \u00a92018 The rare blood clot, which is a cast of the right bronchial tree.\n\nThe photo, upon first glance, is eerily engaging, resembling a red tree that may have sprouted from the imagination of Tim Burton.

Participants in so-called health care share ministries, which are generally cheaper than regular insurance, make monthly contributions to help pay the health care bills of other members. In return, they receive help when they need it.\n\n\n\nHealth care share ministries have grown steadily since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 and required that all Americans enroll in health insurance plans that provided a comprehensive set of benefits detailed in the law. Many members praise the share ministries for their fellowship and as a cheap alternative to paying premiums for commercial health insurance.\n\n\n\nCliff McManis, pastor of Grace Bible Fellowship in Sunnyvale, California, said the option has worked perfectly for his family.\n\n\n\nWhen his family health insurance premiums climbed to about $1,600 a month five years ago, he decided to sign up with Samaritan Ministries, one of the largest sharing ministries in the country.\n\nMcManis, married with four children, says his monthly sharing payments have never exceeded about $450 a month, and he\u2019s been content with the coverage, which has included payments for his son\u2019s surgery for a broken nose and his wife\u2019s recent surgery to remove a tumor in her belly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a hundred percent satisfied,\u201d he said, adding that the prayers offered by members who sent money meant a lot to his family. \u201cThose prayers are probably the biggest encouragement we received,\u201d he said, \u201cand we value that.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut many health care experts warn that members risk being crushed by unforeseen medical bills, and that the growing popularity of the ministries could end up burdening people who don\u2019t participate.\n\n\n\nIn areas where the ministries are especially popular, they might siphon enough healthy people out of the local insurance market to increase premiums, said JoAnn Volk, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms and co-author of an August 2018 brief on health care sharing ministries from the Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy foundation.\n\n\n\nThe ministries are not considered health insurance because, unlike insurance, members are not guaranteed that their claims will be paid. Neither the ministries nor their members assume the financial liability of other members. Participants are not precluded from also having health insurance policies, but the ministries say it\u2019s unlikely that many do.\n\n\n\nWhat gets covered as a \u201cshareable\u201d expense is usually far less comprehensive than what is required by law for health insurance. For example, share ministries often do not cover preventive health care, medicines for chronic conditions, mental health care or treatments arising from \u201cnon-biblical lifestyles,\u201d such as maternity care for out-of-wedlock pregnancies or substance abuse. They do not pay for abortions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is lousy coverage,\u201d Volk said.\n\nFirst Appeared in 1981\n\nThe first formal health care sharing organization didn\u2019t make an appearance until 1981. That\u2019s when the nonprofit Christian Healthcare Ministries in Ohio was formed. It purportedly remains one of the largest share ministries, although it doesn\u2019t disclose membership numbers.\n\n\n\nAt least 104 health care sharing ministries now operate in the United States, according to the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries. Only seven open membership to all comers rather than those from certain denominations or churches. All are Christian. There is no evidence of Jews or Muslims having similar organizations in the United States.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the larger ministries claim to operate in all 50 states, but the alliance says half of the U.S. membership is concentrated in 10 states: California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\n\n\nThe ministries say membership grew steadily after the passage of the ACA, which specifically exempted people belonging to organizations in which members \u201cshare a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs and without regard to the State in which a member resides or is employed.\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the health care sharing ministries were not subject to the penalties levied on those failing to be in an ACA-compliant health plan.\n\n\n\nCongress eliminated that exemption, however, effective next year.\n\n\n\nThe ministries grew from under 200,000 members before the ACA to about a million today, the Commonwealth Fund report says, but those numbers are based on self-reporting.\n\n\n\nThere is little confirmed data about either the membership levels of the largely unregulated organizations or the amount of money they disburse and for which services.\n\n\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries says on its website that its \u201cmembers have shared over $3.5 billion in each other\u2019s healthcare costs\u201d over 35 years.\n\nThirty states passed so-called safe harbor laws for the ministries, stating that they are not insurance companies and are therefore exempt from insurance regulations. But the remaining states do not regulate them either.\n\nBecause the ministries are exempt from insurance regulations, the only recourse members have is to file complaints with state attorneys general. But in their survey of states, authors of the Commonwealth Fund report say even the authority of the attorneys general is limited.\n\nThe large ministries all have internal appeals processes, but members have no recourse to go to court to challenge denials.\n\n\u201cWe tell people that if they have a problem, we can\u2019t help you and the courts can\u2019t help you,\u201d said Martin Swanson, administrator for health policy at the Nebraska Department of Insurance.\n\nShared Values\n\nThe ministries require members to agree to a set of shared values. Solidarity HealthShare, a Catholic-oriented health care sharing ministry with 6,000 members, for example, states, \u201cOur core beliefs are rooted in Sacred Scripture and the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nMost require members to adhere to \u201cvirtuous lifestyles,\u201d which, for Samaritan Ministries, a big ministry with 258,000 members, means no excessive drinking, tobacco and illegal drugs. They also have to attend church at least three out of four weeks and abstain from sex outside of marriage or with someone of the same gender.\n\nAll the ministries say they are rooted in biblical calls to serve fellow humans. \u201cIt\u2019s there in Romans 12,\u201d said Anthony Hopp, a vice president with Samaritan: \u201cBe devoted to one another in love.\u201d\n\nSome of the ministries automatically deduct membership fees from members\u2019 accounts and then disburse the money to needy members. Others instruct members to send checks directly to the other members, which they then verify. Payments may go directly to providers or toward reimbursement of members.\n\n\u201cWe know our contribution is going directly to certain people,\u201d said Kellie Soper of Tempe, Arizona, a tutor whose family has been in a health care sharing ministry since 2016. \u201cWhereas with insurance, it\u2019s just going to some company\u2019s profit.\u201d\n\nThe ministries also place other limits on what constitutes a shareable medical expense. Some do not take people with pre-existing conditions unless they have been symptom-free for a period.\n\nFor example, Christian Healthcare, Christian Care Ministry\u2019s Medi-Share and Samaritan do not cover routine preventive care, such as physicals, mammograms and colonoscopies. Christian Healthcare and Medi-Share do not cover mental health. Several cover prescriptions but only for a limited time.\n\nRichard Gundling, senior vice president of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, an association of financial managers of healthcare organizations, said that most providers are comfortable working with the ministries.\n\nAnd for members of a certain bent, the ministries are a way to meld religious belief with medical necessity."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Marcus Hicks, the head of Special Operations forces in Africa, who was already planning to retire.\n\nThe delays have led to recriminations within the military\u2019s individual fiefs. Army Gen.

He has also leveled criticism that Pentagon leaders are protecting United States Africa Command, which oversees missions across the continent.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Mattis on Oct. 1, General Thomas blamed bad relations between Africa Command and the last commander of American commandos in Africa, Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, as one reason for the failed mission.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation.

Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance.
