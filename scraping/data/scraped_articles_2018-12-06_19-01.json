It sells more smartphones than Apple ( AAPL ) and builds telecommunications networks in countries around the world.\n\nCanadian authorities said late Wednesday that Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Vancouver and that the United States is seeking her extradition.\n\nThe US and Canadian governments haven't specified what charges Meng faces, but her arrest follows reports this year that the US Justice Department was investigating whether Huawei violated American sanctions on Iran.\n\n\"Under the Obama administration, the US indicted Chinese personnel on similar charges, but was reluctant to take more drastic action such as arresting the individuals in third countries, over fear that Beijing would retaliate against US interests in China or in other countries,\" Eurasia Group political risk analysts wrote in a note.\n\nMeng's arrest \"suggests that the gloves are now fully off in this arena,\" the analysts said.\n\nWhat happens next to Meng, the daughter of Huawei's reclusive founder , could have huge repercussions for the US-China relationship and Huawei's business\n\nWhat does it mean for the trade war?\n\nproblems that led to their trade conflict, which has resulted in new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. The arrest comes as the US and Chinese governments are discussing ways to tackleproblems that led to their trade conflict, which has resulted in new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.\n\n\"This type of action will affect the atmosphere around the negotiations \u2014 making them less likely to bring a sustainable settlement,\" the Eurasia Group analysts said.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday it was confident a trade agreement with the United States could still be reached in time to hit a 90-day deadline set by President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the Chinese government is clearly angry about Meng's arrest. The Foreign Ministry called on the United States and Canada to \"immediately correct the wrongdoing\" and restore her \"personal freedom.\"\n\nThe big question is what Beijing and Washington do now. Analysts suggest China could retaliate, and the Trump administration may be preparing other moves against Chinese interests.\n\nThe stakes are extremely high.\n\n\"This case is like a sharp tug on a loose thread that could be part of an unraveling of the relationship,\" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington. \"Both sides need to proceed with abundant caution and a clear sense of their long term interests.\"\n\nHuawei's Meng Wanzhou is also also known as Sabrina Meng and Cathy Meng. She is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei.\n\nThe return to the negotiating table follows a ceasefire reached at a dinner between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Saturday.\n\nBalding pointed out that the deal was reached the same day that Meng was arrested in Canada.\n\n\"That is very politically embarrassing to Xi,\" he said. \"It has to be considered an escalation.\"\n\nWhat does it mean for Huawei?\n\nThe arrest is one of the strongest moves yet against Huawei by US authorities.\n\nThe company is largely shut out of supplying telecommunications equipment to US carriers. American officials have repeatedly alleged that the Chinese government could use Huawei products for espionage \u2014 claims the company denies.\n\nMeng's case \"could be a prelude to further action against the firm and its senior officials,\" Eurasia Group analysts said.\n\nHuawei's smaller rival, ZTE ( ZTCOF ), provides an example of how the US government could go further.

He said the Trump administration would not lift hefty economic sanctions against the regime until then.\n\nTrump has often touted North Korea's lack of ballistic missile tests in recent months as a sign of diplomatic progress and said Kim's offer to dismantle some testing facilities signals the North Korean leader is serious about denuclearizing.\n\nBut while Trump maintains that Kim committed to fully denuclearize during their summit in Singapore this summer, the truth is that the meeting only yielded a vaguely worded agreement, in which the two leaders pledged to build a \"lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\" and to \"work toward complete denuclearization\" of the peninsula.\n\nThe Trump administration has also continued to insist on the elimination of North Korea's ballistic missile programs upfront -- a nonstarter for a nation that remains deeply suspicious of the outside world and would never leave itself strategically vulnerable simply for the promise of economic gain.\n\nWhile closing test facilities would make it harder for North Korea to develop new types of warheads, that step would do little to prevent Kim from continuing to mass produce and deploy existing types of nuclear-armed missiles, as he publicly said in January he would continue to do.\n\n\"Those missiles are being deployed at bases throughout North Korea, many of which have long been known to outside analysts. Any denuclearization agreement would require North Korea to allow international inspectors to determine that these units are no longer armed with nuclear weapons,\" according to the report from Lewis and Schmerler.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has publicly promised to secure access to North Korea military facilities as part of any agreement,\" the report states.\n\nBolton's comments Tuesday underscored the lack of progress the US has made in moving North Korea closer to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization Washington is seeking, and the concessions it has been making to Pyongyang, even as Trump has stressed the warmth of his relationship with Kim.\n\nLast month, Vice President Mike Pence told NBC News that the US will not require North Korea to provide a full list of its nuclear and missile sites before Trump meets again with Kim.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang had been locked in a diplomatic standoff for weeks over which side would make concessions first. Analysts said that by relaxing its demands ahead of a second summit, the US may have blinked first.\n\nPence spoke days after the release of additional new commercial satellite images identifying more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program.\n\nOne such facility is the missile base near Yeongjeo-dong, a site that has long concerned US and South Korean officials and the subject of the analysis of the new images released Wednesday.\n\nIn 2000, the United States sought access to this and other missile bases as part of an agreement to end North Korea's missile program -- and was rebuffed by Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il.\n\nThe base itself is strung along a narrow valley. A headquarters area is positioned at the mouth of the valley, the images show.\n\n\"Up through the valley there are a pair of hardened \"drive-through\" shelters that were covered with soil and had trees planted on them to disguise them. In front of the pair of drive throughs, there is a concrete pad that was also covered in dirt,\" according to the analysis by Lewis and Schmerler.\n\n\"There are five entrances to underground tunnels that may be used to store missiles,\" the report states. \"Around 2010, North Korea constructed a pair of large drive-through suitable for large ballistic missiles.

Four are on city-owned property, and one more is in a privately owned public space.\n\nNow, there's about to be another.\n\nCity officials say they will erect a statue of political pioneer Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress\n\nHonoring a first\n\nElected to the US House of Representatives from New York in 1968, Chisholm also became the first black candidate to seek a major party's presidential nomination and a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. Oh, and she was Brooklyn born and bred.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that she was chosen to be memorialized first as part of a new NYC initiative that aims to add statues of groundbreaking historical women around the city.\n\nShirley Chisholm speaks at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nJane Meyer, the Deputy Press Secretary for the Mayor's Office, told CNN that the process in choosing the initiative's first statue was powered by the public.\n\n\"There was a call for public nominations over the summer,\" she said. \"And we got nearly 2,000 submissions.\"\n\nFrom there, the list went to a working group and then to City Hall, where Meyer says the parks department and other city departments weighed in on the logistical possibilities.\n\nUltimately, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and first lady Chirlane McCray chose between the top vote-getters, which is how Chisholm, who died in 2005, was selected. Her monument will be built in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.\n\nIlluminating hidden histories\n\nDeputy Mayor Glen, a huge advocate for the project, says historical monuments and statues are a critical way for people to understand the values and history of a city, and indeed, the country.\n\n\"The ability to connect to our history happens in a very visual way,\" she told CNN. \"If you don't see it, you may not believe it. And when you walk around the city and only see men, you may start to think that women didn't matter, or perhaps that they didn't do anything.\"\n\nIt's hard to get an accurate tally of how many statues, monuments and plaques around the city are dedicated to men versus women, and Glen says it can be like comparing apples to oranges. Does a plaque count? A relief? What about fictional depictions or anonymous symbolic figures?\n\nGlen offered up a case study: \"Central Park is the most visited urban park in the US,\" she said. \"There are 132 statues in Central Park, and only one of them depicts a woman.\"\n\nA 76-foot statue of explorer Christopher Columbus stands in Columbus Circle in New York City.\n\nThat \"woman\" is Alice from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" who is neither real nor American (author Lewis Carroll was British).\n\n\"Let's just put it this way,\" Glen said, \"The overwhelming majority of these monuments, statues and plaques depict men.\"\n\nThe few depictions of women around the city include the Gertrude Stein Monument in Bryant Park, the Harriet Tubman Monument on Malcolm X Blvd and the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument and Joan of Arc Memorial -- both in Riverside Park. A fifth statue, honoring former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, stands in a privately owned plaza.\n\nMeyer says the new push to add more statues of women around the city was in part inspired by the ongoing conversations about American monuments and their relevancy and value to the modern public (for instance, the recent controversies over Confederate monuments and what to do with them).\n\n\"Across the country, people were looking at controversial monuments and realizing that something should be done, that some monuments should be taken down, and new monuments should be introduced,\" she said. So the mayor's office put together a commission last year to review the monuments around the city.\n\n\"The commission took a look at some of the more controversial monuments and put together a report, and it was clear after that initial review was done (that) there's not enough statues of women,\" she said.\n\nAdding to the story -- not taking away\n\nThe mission of She Built NYC isn't one of removing and replacing history -- as some supporters of Confederate monuments may argue.\n\n\"This is not about deleting history,\" Deputy Mayor Glen said. \"This is about filling out the American story. These women have always been part of it, we just want to exhume their achievements from the coffin of history.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the city's department of cultural affairs set aside $10 million for new monuments. Meyer says the hope is that individual donors will also contribute to the project.\n\nIt's not a monument, but the \"Fearless Girl\" sculpture was a sensation when it debuted near New York's Wall Street in 2017.\n\n\"I think people are excited to be a part of this process,\" she said. \"There's nothing like this in New York City, and now people can have their voice heard and feel really involved in shaping the city.\"\n\nMeyer said She Built NYC is already considering their next monument, and another working group is talking about ways to better honor Native Americans within the city.\n\n\"I think it's undeniable that this concept of if you can see it, you can be it,\" Meyer said. \"Think about little girls who just walk around the city, and all they see is white men on top of horses. That's not what New York City is all about, and it's a false representation of history.

That policy restricted apps' access to Facebook data when the company deemed that the apps \"replicated\" Facebook's \"core functionality.\" In other word, apps that Facebook thought might compete with them.\n\n\"Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video,\" Facebook vice-president Justin Osofsky wrote to Zuckerberg and others the day Vine launched, according to the emails released by the UK Parliament.\n\n\"Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today.

In a blog post Wednesday, Facebook said \"The documents were selectively leaked to publish some, but not all, of the internal discussions at Facebook.\"\n\nZuckerberg himself posted on Facebook as well, writing , \"I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That's healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do. But it's also important that the coverage of what we do -- including the explanation of these internal documents -- doesn't misrepresent our actions or motives. This was an important change to protect our community, and it achieved its goal.\"\n\nThe documents\n\nA California judge had placed the documents under seal. But when Six4Three's CEO, Ted Kramer, was in London last month, he was escorted to Parliament and told to produce the documents or be held in contempt.\n\nSix4Three \u2014 which had an app that allowed users to search for pictures of their friends in swimsuits \u2014 has accused the social media giant of having little regard for user privacy and claimed that Zuckerberg devised a plan that forced some of Facebook's rivals, or potential rivals, out of business. Facebook says the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nThe UK parliamentary committee, led by Damian Collins, asked for the documents as part of a larger investigation into Facebook, fake news, disinformation and data privacy that has been going on for more than a year. The committee has repeatedly asked Zuckerberg to give evidence, but thus far he's avoided the committee, even when it brought together lawmakers from nine different countries for an unprecedented \"International Grand Committee on Disinformation.\"\n\n\"I believe there is considerable public interest in releasing these documents. They raise important questions about how Facebook treats users data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market,\" Collins said on Twitter. \"We don't feel we have had straight answers from Facebook on these important issues, which is why we are releasing the documents.\"\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said in a statement after the release of the documents, \"As we've said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context.

That's because it's doesn't rely on just one or two pieces of evidence. Rather, it's a slew of evidence. This means that even if one part of the case were to fall apart, there would be still be reason to believe that the election wasn't on the level.\n\n1. Signed voter affidavits\n\nNorth Carolina law requires that absentee ballots can only be returned by a voter or a his or her legal guardian or near-relative (e.g. spouse, father-in-law or stepchild). Democratic officials were able to track down voters , however, in Bladen County (part of North Carolina's 9th District) who claimed that non-family members came to their house and promised to deliver their ballots to the state for counting. This practice, known as ballot harvesting, is illegal in the state of North Carolina, which on its own would be enough to question the results of the election.\n\nAt least one voter further claimed that she handed over her ballot even though it wasn't completely filled out and not sealed. It is plausible that these ballots were tampered with once voters handed them over. In a tight election, even a few changed votes could make a big difference.\n\n2. Ballot harvester admission\n\nOne of the ways we know if ballot harvesting is taking place is that absentee ballots have two signed witnesses to ensure the integrity of the process. It would be quite unlikely that one person would be a witness many times because that would likely require them going house to house to be a witness. That might be plausible if they were also helping to deliver the ballots, but remember only near-relatives or legal guardians can deliver ballots by North Carolina law. Yet, there are seven people who were witnesses more than 10 times.\n\nOne of these included Ginger Eason, who was interviewed by local television station WSOC . She admitted on camera that she was paid to collect ballots from people who weren't her near-relative or whom she doesn't have legal guardianship over (which is illegal under state law). Further, Eason admitted that she didn't actually send the ballots she collected to the state. Rather, she handed them to a paid contractor to Harris' campaign, Leslie McCrae Dowless, who paid her for her efforts. What Dowless did with those ballots is unclear.\n\n3. A history of shady activity\n\n4. Weird absentee vote pattern\n\nFiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich looked at how absentee votes in each of 9th District's counties compared to overall vote in the district. As in the primary, Bladen cast a higher percentage of its overall vote via absentee ballot than the rest of the county in the 2018 general election. Not only that, but Harris won a greater margin of the vote in the Bladen County absentees (24 points) than he did in any other county.\n\nOf course, voters in Bladen may have simply liked Harris more than McCready. Yet, in every other county in the district, absentee voters were more likely to vote for McCready than voters casting their ballot via a different method. The average overall was McCready doing 24 points better. In Bladen, absentee voters were 8 points more likely to vote for Harris than other methods.\n\n5. Absentee partisanship makes no sense\n\nAnother way we can check if the absentee votes in Bladen County make any sense is to look at the party registration of those who voted. Professor Michael Bitzer of Catawba College did this.\n\nIn Bladen, 42% were registered Democrats, 39% were registered unaffiliated and 19% were registered Republicans. It would seem unlikely that such a Democratic leaning electorate would favor Harris by a 24-point margin . Still, we would expect some difference between the party registration edge Democrats had and the vote margins.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the disparity would be as great as this, however. In no other county in the district was the difference between the margin in party registration among absentee voters and the margin in the House race greater than 24 points. In Bladen County, it was 47 points. A 47-point difference is possible. You just would think that at least one of the other counties in the district would have had something close to this difference. None did.\n\nEither way, it is quite possible that a new election will need to take place in North Carolina's 9th District."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Congress moves to avert immediate shutdown with two-week funding extension", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ui6LfP33HYk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Congress approved a two-week extension on Thursday for a key government funding deadline, setting up a showdown over spending just days before Christmas that could trigger a partial government shutdown later this month.\n\nThe stopgap spending measure, which now heads to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature, pushes the deadline when funding will expire for several government agencies from December 7 to December 21.

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration. In its September statement, HHS concluded that it is continuing to review \"whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue\" and \"will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "10-minute cancer test could detect cancer anywhere in the body, new study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/_i_KIM0pCRk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Researchers in Australia have developed a 10-minute test that can detect the presence of cancer cells anywhere in the human body, according to a newly published study .\n\nThe test was developed after researchers from the University of Queensland found that cancer forms a unique DNA structure when placed in water.\n\nThe test works by identifying the presence of that structure, a discovery that could help detect cancer in humans far earlier than current methods, according to the paper published in journal Nature Communications\n\n\"Discovering that cancerous DNA molecules formed entirely different 3D nanostructures from normal circulating DNA was a breakthrough that has enabled an entirely new approach to detect cancer non-invasively in any tissue type including blood,\" Professor Matt Trau said in a statement.\n\n\"This led to the creation of inexpensive and portable detection devices that could eventually be used as a diagnostic tool, possibly with a mobile phone,\" he added.\n\nCo-researcher Abu Sina said the findings represented a \"significant discovery\" that could be a \"game changer\" for cancer detection.\n\n\"Cancer is a complicated disease, [and currently] every type has a different testing and screening system.

MUST WATCH Experimental treatment uses modified stem cells to fight cancer 05:58\n\nScientists worldwide have been working on ways to identify cancer earlier, as early detection is known to increase the success rate of therapeutic treatment and surgery.\n\nThis year, researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the United States announced they'd developed a blood test, called CancerSEEK, that screens for eight common cancer types. That test identifies the presence of cancer proteins and gene mutations in blood samples. Much more research needs to be done before that test can be widely used, the US researchers added.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe 10-minute test developed in Australia is yet to be used on humans, and large clinical trials are needed before it can be used on prospective patients. But the signs are positive.\n\nTests on more than 200 tissue and blood samples detected cancerous cells with 90% accuracy, the researchers said.\n\nIt's been used only to detect breast, prostate, bowel and lymphoma cancers, but they're confident the results can be replicated with other types of the disease.\n\nJUST WATCHED Breast cancer: Know the facts Replay More Videos ...

These were different to what we saw with normal tissue DNA in the water,\" the article explains.\n\nThe test uses gold particles, which bind with cancer-affected DNA and \"can affect molecular behavior in a way that causes visible color changes,\" it added.\n\nCarrascosa says that if proved, their method for detecting cancer could be a boon to providing detection and diagnosis in rural or underdeveloped areas. The technology for reading electrochemical signals is readily available, she says, and paired with a smartphone could be adapted to screen DNA affected by cancer.\n\n\"The advantage of this method, it is so simple -- it's almost equipment-free. You can do it with very low resources.\n\n\"There's another possibility that it can be used to monitor for relapses. We haven't tested that yet, but it is a potential.\"\n\nThe next step for the team is to stage clinical studies into how early cancer can be detected,and whether the test can be used to gauge the effectiveness of treatment.\n\nThey're also looking into the possibility of using different bodily fluids to detect different cancer types from early to the later stages of the disease."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "O2 data 'fully restored' by Friday morning", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46464730", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nO2 has said it was \"confident\" its network would be \"fully restored\" to the millions of customers hit by its data outage by Friday morning.\n\nChief executive Mark Evans said the mobile network had identified the issue and would begin restoring services later on Thursday.\n\nMobile network equipment supplier Ericsson had earlier confirmed that an issue with its software was to blame.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Evans apologised to affected customers.\n\nO2 has 25 million customers and also provides services for the Sky, Tesco, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users.\n\nServices such as bus timetable information have also been affected, while many businesses faced disruption.\n\nMr Evans said: \"We have hundreds of people form both Ericsson and O2 working around the clock to identify the issue... we're confident we know what the issue is.\n\n\"We are starting to restore the network this evening, and we're confident, Ericsson have given the assurance that by tomorrow morning it will have been fully restored.\"\n\nEricsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries.\n\nPresident B\u00f6rje Ekholm, said: \"The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned and we apologise not only to our customers but also to their customers.

They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone.\n\nThis must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle.\n\nMs Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence.

The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement.\n\nOn Thursday, Mrs May suggested MPs could be \"given a role\" in deciding whether to activate the backstop - but told the BBC there could be no deal with the EU without it.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any deal\n\nBut the Telegraph reported that she was being urged to delay the vote by ministers.\n\nAsked if the PM should delay the vote, Sir Graham, who chairs the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, told the BBC's Newsnight: \"I think the most important thing is to have clarity about how we might remove ourselves from a backstop, Northern Ireland protocol situation if we were to enter into one in the future.\n\n\"It's having the answer to that question of substance that is most important, not the timing.\n\n\"So if that question can be answered in the course of the next few days, then all well and good.\n\n\"If it can't then I certainly would welcome the vote being deferred until such time as we can answer that question.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Remainer Tory warns over US-style 'partisan bitterness' if deal rejected\n\nOn Thursday, the Labour former prime minister Tony Blair, speaking at a journalists' lunch in Parliament, said the prime minister was facing the prospect of \"hitting a brick wall at speed\" on Tuesday.\n\nAsked if she should pull the 11 December vote, Mr Blair said: \"Personally, I don't see what the point is in going down to a huge defeat.\"\n\nThe government is considering an amendment to next Tuesday's vote motion that would give Parliament more say over the backstop.\n\nOne possible option would see Parliament having a role in deciding whether to extend the transition period or enter the backstop arrangement, if no trade deal has been reached by the end of December 2020.\n\nWill May's suggestion win over any Brexiteers?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs\n\nBy Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\n\nWhat Theresa May sketched out on Thursday was the idea of allowing MPs to choose when and if they want to go into the controversial backstop - the insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nClearly, to try to get some angry Brexiteers to change their minds, the PM is trying to give a sense that they might have more of a say.\n\nThey could, as the agreement already suggests, just extend the \"transition period\", giving the two sides longer to come up with a free trade deal that would mean the dreaded backstop is never used.\n\nIt's not surprising that MPs would have a vote on that. But No 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided.\n\nRead more from Laura here\n\nThe prime minister's suggestion that changes could be made to the backstop to give MPs a role were rejected by Tory MPs on both sides of the debate, who said it was \"cosmetic\" and unlikely to be effective.\n\nThe PM did gain one supporter, however, when Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd announced he was quitting the Liberal Democrat group in the Commons to vote for her deal.\n\nConservative Sir Nicholas Soames has also spoken up for the PM's deal, on the third day of debate about it in the Commons, which is focusing on the economic impact.\n\nMinisters are arguing that Mrs May's deal creates a unique partnership with the EU, while Labour insists it will make people poorer."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Mother of monkey dust drug addict warns of dangers", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-46467780", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:20", "body_paragraphs": "Video\n\nJane Eagles has allowed a BBC film crew into her son's flat to show the devastation the drug monkey dust can cause.\n\nKevin Eagles from Knutton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, is currently in jail after he climbed up on a roof whilst high on the class B drug and threw roof tiles at police.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to criminal damage and affray at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court last month and was sentenced to 20 months in prison.\n\nHis mother told Jeremy Cooke that the drug has ruined her son's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Staffordshire Police has carried out raids on the homes of suspected dealers as part of a crackdown on the problem."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Huawei arrest: China demands release of Meng Wanzhou", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46465768", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:24", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver\n\nChina is demanding the release of telecoms giant Huawei's chief financial officer, who has been detained in Canada.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, the daughter of the company's founder, could face extradition to the US.\n\nShe was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December, but the news was not made public at her request.\n\nThe charges remain unknown but the US has been probing Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran.\n\nChina says her detention is possibly a rights abuse.\n\nMs Meng has sought a publication ban on the details of the arrest, which has been granted by the courts.\n\nHuawei said it was \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng\".\n\nHuawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung.\n\nEuropean shares hit a two-year low and indexes across Asia dropped sharply following the arrest.\n\nHow has China responded?\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters: \"The detention without giving any reason violates a person's human rights.\"\n\n\"We have made solemn representations to Canada and the US, demanding that both parties immediately clarify the reasons for the detention, and immediately release the detainee to protect the person's legal rights.\"\n\nBeijing has itself frequently been accused by rights groups of rights abuses including unexplained detentions.\n\nMs Meng's arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are engaged in a trade war that has seen both impose duties of billions of dollars on one another's goods.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world\n\nBut concerns the arrest would impact the 90-day tariff truce negotiated between the two nations at the G20 have not yet materialised. China announced in a regular press briefing on Thursday that it would \"immediately\" implement the measures agreed.\n\nIt also coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks.\n\nWhat has Canada said?\n\nCanada's ministry of justice confirmed the date and place of Ms Meng's arrest and added: \"She is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday.\"\n\nIt said it could not say more as Ms Meng had sought a ban on the publication of details and this had been ordered by the courts.\n\nThe British Columbia supreme court said she made her first court appearance in Vancouver on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesman for the US justice department in the Eastern District of New York - which Huawei said had brought the charges - declined to comment.\n\nThe gloves are off\n\nBy Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia Business Correspondent\n\nIt is hard to overstate the symbolism and significance of this event. Huawei is the crown jewel of Chinese tech and Ms Meng is effectively its princess.\n\nEven though it's still not clear what the charges against her are, this is not simply a case about the arrest of one woman, or just one company.\n\nThis arrest could materially damage the relationship between the US and China at possibly one of the most sensitive times between the two countries in their long and torrid history.\n\nThe gloves are off. Things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse.\n\nWhat could be behind it?\n\nUS media have reported that Huawei is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran.\n\nOne report in the New York Times said the US commerce and treasury departments had subpoenaed the firm over suspected violation of sanctions against both Iran and North Korea.\n\nUS lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.\n\nReacting to the arrest, US Senator Ben Sasse told Associated Press that China was aggressively engaged in undermining US national security interests, often \"using private sector entities\".\n\n\"Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the chief financial officer,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, Huawei said it had complied with \"all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.\"\n\nThe arrest is a top trending topic on Chinese social media, BBC Monitoring says, with many users criticising the US and Canada for what they call \"low\" and \"bullying\" tactics.\n\nWhy is Huawei a concern to the West?\n\nSome Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2014 investment event in Moscow\n\nSecurity concerns recently led BT to bar Huawei equipment from the heart of the 5G network it is rolling out in the UK.\n\nNew Zealand has blocked Huawei equipment over national security concerns, after Australia imposed a similar ban on both Huawei and fellow communications firm ZTE.\n\nThe US has brought a number of legal cases against Chinese technology firms, with accusations such as cyber-security theft and violations of Iran sanctions.\n\nEarlier this year, it barred US companies from exporting to ZTE, effectively shutting down the firm. The US later replaced the ban with a fine and governance changes.\n\nThe US has also restricted US firms from selling parts to Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua.\n\nThe UK has not blocked firms from using Huawei, although BT, which dominates the UK's telecoms network, said this week it would not use the Chinese firm's equipment in its \"core\" 5G infrastructure.\n\nWhat are the Iran sanctions?\n\nDonald Trump last month reinstated all the US sanctions on Iran that had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nMr Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nThe re-imposed sanctions hit oil exports, shipping and banks - indeed all core parts of Iran's economy.\n\nAlthough there are some waivers, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the US will \"aggressively\" target any firm or organisation \"evading our sanctions\".\n\nThe European Union is standing by the Iran deal and has pledged to protect firms from the impact of US sanctions."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "France protests: Government fears 'major violence' in coming days", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46466268", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:25", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption The scene on Thursday in Nantes, as school students protested against education reforms\n\nThe French government says it fears \"major violence\" in Paris on Saturday as the national \"yellow vests\" protest movement shows little sign of easing.\n\nThe government said it was scrapping the fuel tax increases in its budget - the original spark for the protests.\n\nBut broader discontent with the government has spread, and protests have erupted over several other issues.\n\nOn Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over educational reforms.\n\nMore than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie in Yvelines ended in clashes with police. Dozens of other schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris.\n\nStudents have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality.\n\nMeanwhile, Saturday's planned rally of the yellow vests looks set to go ahead. Recent protests have turned violent, causing millions of euros in damage.\n\nPolice have advised shops and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees to shut for the day. Some museums in Paris have also said they will be closed.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Students at Saint-Exupery high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nPrime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe told the Senate that \"exceptional means\" would be used on Saturday in addition to 65,000 police officers on duty across France.\n\nConfirming that the fuel tax had been abandoned, he told senators that the calm of most protesters around the country contrasted with the \"extreme violence\" seen in Paris.\n\n\"Unlike others, I'm not seeking to apportion blame for this anger,\" he said. As mayor of the northern port of Le Havre he said he had felt local anger rise every year, after every election. \"It's been muted for a long time, because it's been silenced for a long time, by shame, sometimes by pride.\"\n\nAccording to French media, Mr Philippe will decide on Saturday whether to deploy armoured vehicles to clear roads in Paris if barricades are erected. Such a deployment has not taken place since 1968.\n\nWhat is the government worried about?\n\nThe protest on Saturday 1 December descended into the worst rioting seen in decades, with hundreds of injuries and arrests.\n\nThe government says extremists hijacked the protests and incited violence.\n\nFrench health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, speaking to RTL Radio on Thursday morning, said: \"There is a concern about this violence, and some who do not want to find a solution.\"\n\nThe government is considering mobilising the military to protect important national monuments, French broadcaster BFMTV reported, after the world-famous Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week.\n\nA series of football matches have also been postponed. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille.\n\nHow are the protests spreading?\n\nThe yellow vests protests have moved beyond the initial anger over fuel taxes. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government.\n\nAmong them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age.\n\nThe government has already acknowledged some of the concerns, suggesting it may review the \"wealth tax\" it abolished after taking power.\n\nAn analysis of its original budget plans for 2018-2019 showed it benefitted the very wealthy rather than the very poor.\n\nOther groups, bolstered by the success of the national movement, have also begun separate actions.\n\nOne police union, Vigi, called for a strike of its administrative staff working in the interior ministry for Saturday - saying that without the support of such staff, riot police would be immobilised.\n\nTwo road transport unions, the CGT and FO, have called for a strike among its 700,000 members on Sunday, Le Monde reported. Drivers have been affected by changes to overtime payments, the unions say, which affect the purchasing power of its members."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Afghanistan's 'Little Messi' flees home after Taliban threats, says family", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46471902", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP / Unicef Image caption Murtaza Ahmadi with a signed Messi shirt, which was sent to him after being photographed in a homemade version\n\nA young Afghan boy who was made famous online for his devotion to footballer Lionel Messi has been forced to flee his home for the second time.\n\nMurtaza Ahmadi, now aged seven, went viral in 2016 after being photographed wearing a homemade Messi shirt, fashioned out of a plastic bag.\n\nHe later met his hero in Qatar.\n\nHis family say they have now abandoned their home in Afghanistan, after receiving threats from the Taliban.\n\nThey were living in the south-eastern Ghazni province - which militants have been targeting - and have escaped to the capital, Kabul.\n\nThey previously sought short-term refuge in Pakistan in 2016, but returned when they ran out of money, according to AFP news agency.\n\nThe makeshift shirt\n\nMurtaza was five years old when he wore a plastic-bag shirt in the white-and-blue colours of the Argentine national team, which Messi captains.

But Number 10 clearly hopes it will give some grumpy MPs a sense that they will have more of a say, introducing another layer of decision-making so that the backstop can be avoided.\n\nRead more from Laura here\n\nPlan is a 'red herring'\n\nBut reacting to the latest proposals, Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said that if MPs passed the EU withdrawal agreement they would not be able to change the backstop because it would be part of a \"standalone international treaty\".\n\nSo MPs would be limited to saying \"should we ask for an extension or should we let ourselves go in\".\n\nFellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal, said the PM's proposals were a \"red herring\" that would be \"ineffective\".\n\nAnd remain supporter Phillip Lee, who also quit as a minister over the deal and now backs a further referendum, dismissed the PM's \"cosmetic concessions\".\n\n\"It's clear that none of the big Brexit questions will be solved by this withdrawal agreement, and that the Brexit on offer is much worse than the deal we've already got in the EU,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister's support has grown by one, however, after Eastbourne MP

But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness \"probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion\".\n\nHe also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nSir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more \"risk averse\" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment.

Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.\n\n\"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.\n\nA previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate.

It had lost the scales characteristic of its ancestors.\n\nThe ichthyosaur's outer layer is still somewhat flexible and retains evidence of the animal's camouflage pattern.\n\nThe reptile was counter-shaded - darker on the upper side and light on the underside. This counter-balances the shading effects of natural light, making the animal more difficult to see.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurs are interesting because they have many traits in common with dolphins, but are not at all closely related to those sea-dwelling mammals,\" said co-author Mary Schweitzer, professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU).\n\nTheir similar appearance suggests that ichthyosaurs and whales evolved similar strategies to adapt to marine life - an example of convergent evolution.\n\nProf Schweitzer said: \"They have many features in common with living marine reptiles like sea turtles, but we know from the fossil record that they gave live birth, which is associated with warm-bloodedness.\"\n\nMost reptiles today are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is determined by the warmth of their surroundings. Blubber helps some marine animals maintain a high body temperature regardless of the ocean water temperature.\n\nCo-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News: \"Blubber is found in living marine mammals but notably also adult individuals of the leatherback sea turtle. Its primary role in all of these animals seems to be insulation, and the leatherback is unique in many aspects.\n\nImage copyright Johan Lindgren / Martin Jarenmark Image caption Comparisons between artificially matured modern porpoise blubber and skin and the equivalent from a fossil ichthyosaur.\n\n\"It has metabolic rates that are higher than are those of typical reptiles, and a suite of measures for heat retention and control, and collectively these enable adult leatherbacks to venture into cold water environments.\n\n\"So, ichthyosaurs were able to control their body temperature at least as well as leatherbacks, but then it is hard to say if they were fully endothermic (warm-blooded) or not.\"\n\nThe researchers identified the blubber and skin remains on a well-preserved ichthyosaur specimen held by the Urweltmuseum Hauff in Germany. It was discovered in Holzmaden quarry, in the country's south-west, which has produced many other well-preserved fossils from the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe fossil was subjected to an exhaustive analysis of its microscopic structure and molecular composition.\n\n\"Both the body outline and remnants of internal organs are clearly visible,\" said co-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden.\n\n\"Remarkably, the fossil is so well-preserved that it is possible to observe individual cellular layers within its skin.\"\n\nThe researchers identified cell-like microstructures which probably held pigment, and an internal organ thought to be the animal's liver.\n\nThe blubber-like material contained fragments of fatty acid molecules.\n\n\"This is the first direct, chemical evidence for warm-bloodedness in an ichthyosaur, because blubber is a feature of warm-blooded animals,\" said Prof Schweitzer.\n\nTo provide additional support for this idea, the researchers artificially matured the blubber of a modern porpoise, exposing it to high temperatures and pressures - as it would be during the process of fossilisation.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: The fossil belongs to a type of ichthyosaur called Stenopterygius\n\nThe resulting \"matured\" porpoise blubber shared many features with the fossilised version.\n\nAs for the ichthyosaur's skin, the camouflage pattern would have provided protection from Jurassic predators such as flying pterosaurs, attacking from above, and pliosaurs (even bigger marine reptiles), which would have attacked from below.\n\nDr Lindgren said: \"Given the density of pigment cells, and the fact that they occur in both the epidermis and dermis, we hypothesise that ichthyosaurs had a really dark dorsal (upper) skin, which is also what you see in many extant whales that are deep divers (as ichthyosaurs) and venture into cold, arctic regions (as did ichthyosaurs).\n\n\"A melanic (dark) colouration would benefit ichthyosaurs as a UV protection while at the sea surface, but could perhaps also help ichthyosaurs thermoregulate as is the case in the leatherback sea turtle.\"\n\nLosing the scales and evolving smooth skin would also have helped ichthyosaurs manoeuvre more easily underwater.\n\nJohan Lindgren said the still-flexible skin meant the specimen must have been fossilised so fast that organic molecules were trapped inside the mineral component of the fossil.\n\n\"Soft tissues, such as skin, have hitherto been considered to be so labile (easily broken down) that the only way they can survive is via full replacement by minerals. However, as it turns out, when these minerals are removed, some of the original organics remain,\" Dr Lindgren explained.\n\nThe results are published in the journal Nature.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Cars and coal help drive 'strong' CO2 rise in 2018", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46447459", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The main factor in the rise is coal use in China\n\nA booming global market for cars has helped drive CO2 emissions to an all-time high in 2018, say researchers.\n\nThe main factor in the near 3% rise has been coal use in China, driven by government efforts to boost a flagging economy.\n\nBut emissions from cars, truck and planes using fossil fuels continue to rise in all parts of the world\n\nRenewables have also grown this year, but are not keeping pace with the CO2 rise.\n\nThe research, carried out by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), says that this year's \"strong\" rise is projected to be 2.7%.\n\nThat's much bigger than 2017's 1.6%. This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before.\n\nSo what's caused the rise?\n\nWhile coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%.\n\nAt UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity.\n\n\"For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,\" she said.\n\nOther factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy.\n\nWho are the biggest emitters?\n\n2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.\n\nA booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%. Renewables are growing fast but from a low base.\n\nThe five countries contributing most to growth in global emissions outside of China, the US, the EU and India over the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea.\n\nClimate change: Where we are in seven charts\n\nWhat's happening with cars?\n\nOne common factor across rich and poor countries alike has been the continued rise in the consumption of oil in the transport sector. In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%.\n\n\"Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world.\"\n\nAccording to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries.\n\nWhat does this year's rise in CO2 mean?\n\nImage copyright Robert Alexander Image caption Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough\n\nIt's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nPeople are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed.\n\n\"Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,\" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis.\n\n\"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.\"\n\nHow are people at COP24 reacting to the rise?\n\nIt is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress.\n\n\"All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,\" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid.\n\n\"The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n\n\"If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?\"\n\nIs anything being done to limit emissions from cars and trucks?\n\nDespite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine.\n\nWhile they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally.\n\nNorway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025. The UK, France, the Netherlands and India say they will stop before 2040.\n\nCar manufacturers are responding to the fork in the road. Volkswagen says it will launch its last generation of petrol and diesel cars by 2026.\n\nThe move has been welcomed but many think it is not fast enough.\n\n\"We simply cannot wait nearly a quarter of a century to phase out the cars warming our climate and making our air toxic,\" said Rosie Rogers from Greenpeace.\n\n\"People living in polluted cities and facing climate change-related disasters deserve better than that.\"\n\nWhere's the good news here?\n\nThe overall growth in green energy has not been enough to keep pace with the rise in emissions - but that bald headline masks some significant progress, say experts.\n\nThe costs of renewables continue to plummet. Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas.\n\nMore than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years. Coal is going backwards in most of the developed world.\n\nWhile the US may not be staying in the Paris agreement, most US citizens live in a jurisdiction that still supports the Paris goals.\n\nAround the world, some 9,000 cities and municipalities representing some 16% of the world's population are committed to Paris.\n\nOver the past decade, 19 countries including the UK, Ireland, France and the US have all cut emissions while growing their economies.\n\n\"Before 2015, many people thought the Paris Agreement was impossible, yet thousands of people and institutions made the shift from impossible to unstoppable,\" wrote former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, in a commentary on the research.\n\n\"The same is true of decarbonising the economy.

The whereabouts of his body are still unknown.\n\nHere are the latest related developments:\n\nThursday, December 6\n\nDeposed aide to Saudi crown prince accused of role in female activist torture\n\nA top aide to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, fired for his role in the killing of Khashoggi, personally oversaw the torture of at least one detained female activist earlier this year, two sources told Reuters news agency.\n\nSaud al-Qahtani was a royal adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman until October, when he was sacked and then sanctioned by the US Treasury over the Washington Post columnist's murder.\n\nThree sources, briefed on the activists' treatment, say a group of men subjected this woman and at least three others to sexual harassment, electrocution, and flogging between May and August at an unofficial holding facility in Jeddah.\n\nThey described the group of about six men as distinct from the regular interrogators the women saw and said they belonged to the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones, which Qahtani headed at the time, or to state security.\n\nQahtani was present when at least one of the women was tortured, two of the sources said.\n\nA Saudi official said the allegations of mistreatment and torture of the female detainees were \"false ... and have no connection to the truth\".\n\n\"The detainees were detained based on accusations related to harming the security and stability of the kingdom,\" the official said in response to questions from Reuters.\n\nThe women are among more than a dozen prominent activists arrested since May amid a broader crackdown targeting clerics and intellectuals. Activists say 11 women are still being held, including the four alleged to have been tortured.\n\nTurkey should submit a formal request to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to conduct an independent international probe into the killing of Khashoggi, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe investigation, the rights group said, would cut through attempts intended to protect Saudi officials and muddle the truth.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has come under increasing scrutiny with many publicly accusing him of complicity in the assassination.\n\n\"A UN investigation has the best chance of pushing Saudi Arabia to provide the needed facts and information about Mohammed bin Salman's precise role in this murder - information that is available only from sources in Saudi Arabia,\" Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSix top US senators from across party lines have introduced a scathing resolution to hold the Saudi crown prince accountable for the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nThe proposal says the Senate \"has a high level of confidence\" that Mohammed bin Salman \"was complicit in the murder\".\n\n\"This resolution - without equivocation - definitively states that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was complicit in the murder of Mr Khashoggi and has been a wrecking ball to the region jeopardising our national security interests on multiple fronts,\" Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator and close ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement.\n\nRead more here\n\nWednesday, December 5\n\nUN's Bachelet seeks international inquiry into Khashoggi murder\n\nUnited Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Wednesday that an international investigation was needed to determine who was responsible for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.\n\nBachelet, asked at a news conference in Geneva about the need for an international inquiry, replied: \"I do believe it is really needed in terms of ensuring what really happened and who are the (people) responsible for that awful killing.\"\n\nSenior US senators said on Tuesday, after receiving a CIA briefing on the matter, that they were more certain than ever that Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nOscar-winning actor and filmmaker Sean Penn has reportedly begun filming a new documentary about Khashoggi's killing.\n\nThe US actor, accompanied by a crew of around 10 including bodyguards, was spotted shooting in front of the consulate building in Istanbul on Wednesday, Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\n\n181206035658278\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner was also seen outside the consul general's nearby residence, the agency said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIstanbul's chief prosecutor's office has filed arrest warrants for Saudi officials believed to be involved in the Khashoggi's killing.\n\nThe prosecutor's office believes there is \"strong suspicion\" that Ahmed al-Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani were among the planners of the murder, which took place shortly after Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.\n\nA senior Turkish official told Reuters news agency that the move reflects the view that Saudi authorities will not take formal action against al-Asiri and al-Qahtani, both close allies of Prince Mohammed.\n\nOn Tuesday, US senators, who held a meeting with CIA Director Gina Haspel, said they are even more convinced that Prince Mohammed was involved in the death of the Saudi journalist.\n\nTuesday, December 4\n\nSenators leaving a briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel say they are even more convinced that Saudi Prince Mohammed was involved in the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he believes if the crown prince were put on trial, a jury would find him guilty in \"about 30 minutes\".\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said there is \"zero chance\" the crown prince wasn't involved in Khashoggi's death.\n\nMonday, December 3\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel will give a closed-door briefing to leaders of several US Senate committees this week on the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, US media reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the briefing will take place on Tuesday.\n\nReuters news agency, citing a source familiar with the planned meeting, said Haspel will brief the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Appropriations committees.

The phone's microphone can also be turned on remotely, allowing the spyware to listen in on conversations without the owner of the phone realising he or she is being listened to.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Abdulaziz claims the Saudi government spied on conversations he had with Khashoggi.\n\nIn a response to the lawsuit, NSO Group said in a statement \"licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nSunday, December 2\n\n181205055637618\n\nKhashoggi's WhatsApp messages may offer clues to killing: CNN\n\nMore than 400 private WhatsApp messages sent by Khashoggi last year to a fellow Saudi exile may offer fresh clues to the killing of the dissident journalist, according to a report.\n\nIn his conversation with Canada-based activist Omar Abdulaziz - accessed by CNN - Khashoggi describes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, as a \"beast\" and a \"Pac-man\" who would \"devour all in his path, even his supporters\".\n\n\"Arrests are unjustified and do not serve him [logic says], but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast 'Pac-Man' the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows,\" Khashoggi wrote, according to CNN.\n\nThe messages shared by Abdulaziz include voice recordings, photos and videos. The conversation reveals the two were planning an \"online youth movement\", CNN reported.\n\nAbdulaziz believes the messages between him and Khashoggi were intercepted by Saudi authorities in August, two months before the journalist was killed by Saudi nationals inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nAbdulaziz told CNN he plans to join a lawsuit against an Israeli company that reportedly invented the software to hack his phone.\n\nHe told the US broadcaster that the phone's hacking \"played a major role in what happened to Jamal\".\n\n\"The guilt is killing me,\" he said.\n\nPrince Mohammed arrives in Algeria\n\nPrince Mohammed arrived in the Algerian capital, Algiers, after a brief visit to Mauritania earlier in the day.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince was resuming a tour of Arab countries after attending the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nBefore attending the G20 summit, he had visited the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia.\n\nThe official Algeria Press Service said Algerian-Saudi investments and trade relations in sectors including oil and petrochemicals would be discussed during the two-day visit.\n\nSaudi crown prince visits Mauritania\n\nPrince Mohammed arrived in Mauritania, resuming his tour of Arab countries after attending the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nSaudi state TV showed footage of the crown prince's plane arriving in the capital Nouakchott.

He said Ankara has shared this evidence with all countries who requested it, including the United States, Britain, Germany and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPompeo: No direct evidence linking MBS to Khashoggi killing\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he had seen all the intelligence possessed by the United States on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and repeated that no direct evidence links Prince Mohammed to the incident.\n\n\"I have read every piece of intelligence that is in the possession of United States government,\" Pompeo said in an interview with broadcaster CNN in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 summit.\n\nPrince Mohammed sent 11 messages to his closest adviser, who reportedly oversaw the operatives who killed Khashoggi, in the hours before and after the journalist's murder on October 2, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nThe Journal said on Saturday it had reviewed excerpts of an intelligence file that was classified as \"highly confidential\", which cites electronic intercepts and other covert information between Prince Mohammed and his aide, Saud al-Qahtani.\n\nHowever, the content of the messages between the two parties is unknown.\n\n\"To be clear, we lack direct reports that the crown prince issued the order of murder,\" the assessment notes, according to the Journal.\n\nThe assessment reports that al-Qahtani, who supervised the 15-man team that killed Khashoggi, was also in direct communication with the team's leader in Istanbul\n\nFriday, November 30\n\nMacron meets MBS on G20 sidelines\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Europe would insist on international experts being part of the investigation into the murder of Khashoggi.\n\nIn a five-minute exchange on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, Macron conveyed \"very firm\" messages to the prince over the killing and the need to find a political solution for the situation in Yemen, an Elysee official also said.\n\nThe Saudi Gazette newspaper posted a video of the meeting online showing the two speaking in hushed tones with their heads close together, Macron looking the crown prince in the eye and Prince Mohammed nodding his head and at times smiling.\n\nIn the audio, it is possible to make out the prince saying \"Don't worry\", to which Macron responds \"I am worried\". Later in the one-minute clip Macron says: \"You never listen to me\" and the crown prince replies: \"I will listen, of course.\"\n\nAt the end, Macron can be heard saying: \"I am a man of my word.\"\n\nUK PM May to demand 'accountability' from Saudi prince over Khashoggi\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May plans to raise the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and the situation in Yemen with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nThe killing of the Washington Post columnist, a critic of the crown prince, has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered Prince Mohammed's image abroad. Saudi Arabia has said he had no prior knowledge of the murder.\n\n\"I am intending to speak with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.

But Graham said the briefing was \"inadequate\" without the CIA speaking directly about the intelligence it has on Saudi Arabia's involvement in the killing.\n\nGraham said he's willing to hold up the legislative agenda, including legislation to fund the government, until he hears from the agency.\n\nHe told reporters, \"Anything that you need me for to get out of town, I ain't doing it until we hear from the CIA.\"\n\nAsked whether he had communicated that to President Trump, Graham answered: \"I just did.\"\n\nUS defence chief: 'No smoking gun' linking Saudi crown prince to Khashoggi killing\n\nUS Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Wednesday the US has \"no smoking gun\" that Prince Mohammed was involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month.\n\nAsked about reports that a CIA assessment earlier this month concluded the crown prince had ordered Khashoggi's death, Mattis referred journalists back to the intelligence agency.\n\n\"We have no smoking gun the crown prince was involved, not the intelligence community or anyone else.\n\nThere is no smoking gun,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon, adding that the US still expected those responsible for the killing to be held accountable.\n\nPompeo says downgrading US ties to Saudi Arabia would be mistake\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that downgrading US ties with Saudi Arabia would be a mistake for national security and would not push Saudis in a better direction at home.\n\n\"The October murder of Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey has heightened the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on.

While Trump has equivocated over who is to blame, the Senate is considering a vote as soon as this week to halt US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\n\"What obviously happened, as basically certified by the CIA, is completely abhorrent to everything the United States holds dear and stands for in the world,\" McConnell said. \"We're discussing what the appropriate response would be.\"\n\nMattis and Pompeo are expected to address the Senate at 16:00 GMT in Washington, DC.\n\nSaudi crown prince leaves Tunisia to Argentina to attend G20 summit\n\nReuters news agency is reporting that Prince Mohammad left Tunisia early on Wednesday for Argentina to attend the G20 summit, where all eyes will be on world leaders' reaction to the man accused of ordering Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe crown prince's G20 attendance is a bold effort to force the issue of whether world leaders will work with Saudi Arabia, analysts say. Riyadh is also indicating with his appearance in Buenos Aires that Prince Mohammed is back in the saddle and the worst of the controversy is over.\n\nHuman Rights Watch requested that Argentine authorities arrest the crown prince and that he be tried by a court for war crimes in Yemen and Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTurkey FM on Saudi killer: 'He likes to cut up people'\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for the first time recounted gruesome details from audio tapes purportedly of the killing, confirming some of the content that has so far only been leaked by Turkish media.\n\nA Saudi forensics doctor involved in the Istanbul consulate murder is \"instructing the others they should listen to music while he dismembers the body\", Cavusoglu said in an interview with German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung published on Tuesday.\n\n\"You can tell he is enjoying it,\" he said. \"He likes to cut up people.

Erdogan's answer was 'Let's see',\" Cavusoglu told Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.\n\nErdogan and Prince Mohammed will attend the G20 meeting in Argentina later this week. \"At the moment there is no reason not to meet with the crown prince,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nSaudi-Turkish relations have been strained by the killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul.\n\nArgentina pressed to probe Saudi prince over Yemen, Khashoggi\n\nArgentina has been asked to investigate Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for possible war crimes in Yemen and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said it submitted the request to Argentina's federal judge Ariel Lijo on Monday. Prince Mohammed is expected to arrive in Buenos Aires on Friday for the G20 summit.\n\nArgentina's constitution recognises universal jurisdiction for war crimes and torture, meaning judicial authorities can investigate and prosecute those crimes no matter where they were committed.\n\n\"There's an extremely strong basis for Argentina to closely examine a very broad record of documentation and facts. People around the world are desperate to see real accountability for people who are getting away with terrible crimes,\" HRW's Middle East and North Africa director Sarah Leah Whitson told Al Jazeera.\n\nMonday, November 26\n\nUS politicians' concern on Saudi Arabia prompts Pompeo, Mattis briefing\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis will brief the US Senate on Wednesday on the latest developments related to Saudi Arabia, Senator John Cornyn, the number two Senate Republican, told reporters on Monday.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said earlier this month he wanted Pompeo, Mattis and CIA Director Gina Haspel to come to the Capitol for a classified Senate briefing.\n\nA Senate aide said Haspel is not scheduled to be involved in Wednesday's briefing, which will take place at 11am (16:00 GMT). A House of Representatives aide said no similar briefing had been scheduled in that chamber.\n\nCornyn also said he thought the Senate would vote on a Yemen resolution introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders seeking to pull back any US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Asked if the measure, which failed earlier this year, stood a chance of passage now, Cornyn said he did not want to \"give Iran a pass.\"\n\nTurkish police search properties linked to Saudi businessmen\n\nPolice searched two villas in the province of Yalova, just south of Istanbul, in connection with the search for Jamal Khashoggi's body.\n\nOfficials brought sniffer dogs and forensic teams were also on the scene.\n\nThe Istanbul prosecutor's office said one of the villas belongs to a Saudi businessman named Mohammed Ahmed Alfaouzan, who is allegedly close to the Saudi crown prince, Turkish media reported.\n\nTurkish media outlets also said Alfaouzan received the phone call from Mansour Othman Abahussain, an officer in the Saudi military and one of the 15 men accused of carrying out the Washington Post journalist's killing.\n\n\"According to the Turkish prosecutor, a phone call was made a day before Mr Khashoggi was killed to the villa, and in that conversation, details were discussed as to how to dispose of Mr Khashoggi's body,\" Al Jazeera's Tony Birtley said.\n\nSunday, November 25\n\nMembers of US Congress disagree with Trump on Khashoggi murder\n\nAdam Schiff, a Democratic senator who is set to lead the House Intelligence Committee when the US Congress returns in January, accused President Donald Trump of not telling the truth in his response to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nTrump said earlier this week that a CIA report lacks evidence to blame Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of the Washington Post columnist.\n\n\"I think the president is being dishonest with the American people,\" Schiff said during an interview with CNN.\n\n\"It would be one thing if he said 'this is what has happened but nonetheless we need to maintain a relationship with the kingdom, but that is not what he is doing,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"It telegraphs to despots around the world they can murder with impunity and that this president will have their back as long as they praise him or do business with him.\"\n\nSchiff's comments were echoed by Mike Lee, a senator from Trump's Republican party, who called on Congress to take action\n\nLee said on NBC's Meet the Press that he disagreed with Trump's allegations that information from US intelligence services does not implicate Prince Mohammed in the killing.\n\n\"I disagree with the president's assessment. It's inconsistent with the intelligence I've seen,\" Lee said during the interview.\n\n\"I don't know why he's siding with the Saudis, but I think there are things we can do to change our relationship with the Saudis notwithstanding whatever his personal motivations might be,\" Lee added.\n\n\"But again, I think Congress has to take some ownership of US foreign policy.\"\n\nLee added that he was certain that the next US Congress, which will be inaugurated in January, will look into Trump's alleged ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSenior Saudi prince casts doubt on reported CIA findings\n\nA senior Saudi prince cast doubt on the reported CIA finding that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month, saying the agency could not be counted on to reach a credible conclusion.\n\n\"The CIA is not necessarily the highest standard of veracity or accuracy in assessing situations. The examples of that are multitude,\" Prince Turki al-Faisal, a senior member of the royal family, told journalists in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.\n\nThe prince, a former Saudi intelligence chief who has also served as ambassador to the United States, said the agency's conclusion that Iraq possessed chemical weapons before the US invasion in 2003 showed it could be unreliable.\n\n\"I don't see why the CIA is not on trial in the United States. This is my answer to their assessment of who is guilty and who is not and who did what in the consulate in Istanbul,\" he said.\n\nSaturday, November 24\n\nDaughters vow to keep Khashoggi legacy alive\n\nThe two daughters of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi have vowed to keep the legacy of their father alive, in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post.\n\nFor Noha Khashoggi and Razan Jamal Khashoggi, growing up included visits to countless museums and historical sites, reflecting their parents' love of knowledge.\n\nThe sisters recalled staying up nights wondering what their father was doing on one of his many trips abroad, \"trusting that no matter how long he was gone, we would see him again, wide-armed, waiting for a hug\".\n\n\"As bittersweet as it was, we knew from a young age that Dad's work meant that his reach extended far beyond our family, that he was an important man whose words had an effect on people over a great distance.\"\n\nThey recounted the days after their father was first reported missing and how the family had visited his home in Virginia.\n\n\"The hardest part was seeing his empty chair. His absence was deafening. We could see him sitting there, glasses on his forehead, reading or typing away.\"\n\n\"This is no eulogy, for that would confer a state of closure. Rather, this is a promise that his light will never fade, that his legacy will be preserved within us,\" they wrote.\n\nFriday, November 23\n\nKhashoggi murder planned 12 days in advance, Turkish officials say\n\nTurkish investigators analysing phone calls and the movement of the suspects in Khashoggi's murder have told Al Jazeera that the operation to kill the journalist was planned 12 days in advance.\n\nInvestigators sifting through 19 phone calls made by Maher Mutreb, thought to be the lead negotiator inside the consulate, to Saudi Arabia have found that four of them were made to Saud al-Qahtani and that there is a third voice on the calls.\n\nAl-Qahtani was believed to be the right-hand man of Prince Mohammed before being removed as a royal court adviser following the uproar over the murder.\n\n\"Today we learned from the officials that when Mutreb and al-Qahtani were talking on the phone, there was a third voice coming from the background of al-Qahtani's phone ... Al-Qahtani was transferring the information that he got from Mutreb to that third person,\" Al Jazeera's Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said.\n\n\"According to Turkish officials, they strongly believe that this third voice could belong to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but the technical analysis hasn't concluded that yet because Mutreb was doing all these calls from his Saudi mobile phone and technically Turkey needs support to analyse it properly, \" she said.\n\nIt has also come to light that along with the Saudi consul-general, three other Saudi nationals employed in the consulate are considered prime suspects in the investigation into Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTurkish officials say those employees fled Turkey within three days of the consul-general also leaving the country shortly after Khashoggi's murder.\n\nOne of the employees, who is thought to be linked to the Saudi intelligence agency, travelled to Riyadh 72 hours before Khashoggi's arrival and returned to the consulate in Istanbul just before Khashoggi.\n\nCavusoglu: Trump shows he will turn blind eye to Khashoggi murder\n\nUS President Donald Trump's latest comments about the killing of Khashoggi show that he will \"turn a blind eye\" to the issue regardless of what investigators uncover, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said.\n\nTrump has vowed to retain Saudi Arabia as a \"steadfast partner\" despite saying that the kingdom's crown prince may have known about the plan to murder the journalist.\n\nCriticising Trump for prioritising commercial relations over justice, Cavusoglu said that human life should take precedence.\n\n\"This statement that Trump made also means: 'No matter what happens, I will turn a blind eye.' This is not a correct approach. Not everything is money,\" Cavusoglu told broadcaster CNN Turk on Friday.\n\nThe foreign minister also commented on recent moves by European partners in relation to the case.\n\nOn Monday, Germany said it would bar 18 Saudis from entering its territory and Europe's Schengen passport-free zone over their alleged links to the murder.\n\n\n\nIn October, Germany called for EU countries to follow its lead and suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia, prompting a dismissive response from France.\n\n\n\nBut Denmark on Thursday followed suit, freezing all sales of weapons and military equipment to Riyadh.\n\n\n\nCavusoglu said \"artificial measures\" would not help solve the crisis.\n\n\n\n\"They (Europe) say they don't want to upset ties with Saudi Arabia. We do not want to upset our relations either,\" he said, but added Ankara would do anything to shed light on the murder.\n\nTrump: CIA did not conclude MBS ordered murder\n\nPresident Trump said that the CIA did not conclude that Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, ordered the murder of Khashoggi.\n\nUS intelligence officials have reportedly said that the operation would have needed the approval at the highest levels, but the Saudis have strongly denied allegations that MBS was involved.\n\nWhen asked about the CIA's findings, Trump said that the intelligence agency \"didn't conclude\".\n\nCiting vehement denials by MBS and King Salman, Trump said that \"maybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a vicious place\".\n\n\"I hate the crime, I hate the cover-up. I will tell you this: The crown prince hates it more than I do, and they have vehemently denied it,\" he said.\n\nThursday, November 22\n\nEU's Mogherini calls for 'credible investigation'\n\nA transparent and credible investigation into the killing of Khashoggi has not yet been completed, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, said on Thursday, after talks with Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn and Cavusoglu in Ankara, Mogherini also said she was completely against any application of the death penalty.\n\nOn his part, Cavusoglu said the Khashoggi investigation was taking a long time and the international community expected an independent probe into the case.\n\nDenmark suspends weapon export approvals to Saudi\n\nDenmark has decided to suspend approvals of weapon and military equipment exports to Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the situation in Yemen, its foreign minister said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision was taken after recent discussions with other foreign ministers in the European Union, he added.\n\nThe suspension also includes some dual-use technologies, a reference to materials that might have military applications.\n\nJournalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder was an \"unfortunate accident\" and any discussion that Prince Mohammed was responsible and may not take the throne is \"outrageous\", Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said.\n\nIn a series of interviews on Wednesday, al-Jubeir reiterated that calls for MBS to be held accountable for Khashoggi's shocking killing are a \"red line\".\n\n\"We will not tolerate any discussion of anything that is disparaging towards our monarch or our crown prince,\" al-Jubeir told the BBC.\n\nOn other television networks, Jubeir steadfastly defended MBS despite a CIA assessment reportedly saying there was \"high probability\" that he ordered the murder.\n\n\"We have made it very clear that Saudi Arabia's government is not involved in this and the crown prince is not involved in this at all,\" he told US network CNBC.\n\nThe foreign minister was also asked about a Reuters news agency report this week that quoted Saudi sources saying a move was in play to prevent MBS from ascending the throne once his father, King Salman, 82, dies.\n\n\"These are outrageous comments that have been made and are totally unacceptable. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to its leadership,\" he said.\n\n\"The crown prince has the confidence of every Saudi citizen, including King Salman. The crown prince is the architect and driving force behind the reform programme in Saudi Arabia and the Vision of 2030,\" Jubeir told CBS.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement on Wednesday, Reuters said: \"We stand by our story.\"\n\nWednesday, November 21\n\nUS senators accused Trump of putting \"Saudi Arabia first\" in his decision to not take punitive measures against the kingdom or Prince Mohammed over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nTrump's decision is \"yet another fawning prostration to a foreign authoritarian\", Democratic Senator Tim Kaine tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time until actions like this one by the president directly threaten our security,\" he added.\n\nUS newspaper blasts Trump's 'business as usual' with Saudi\n\nThe Washington Post denounced President Trump's decision to refrain from punishing Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi's death.\n\nThe Saudi writer, who was based in the US, wrote columns critical of the Saudi royal family for the newspaper.\n\nIn a statement published on Twitter, Washington Post publisher, Fred Ryan, accused Trump of putting personal relationships and commercial interests above American values of respect for human rights to continue to \"do business as usual\" with the Saudi crown prince.\n\nRyan further stated the CIA had \"concluded with high confidence\" that Prince Mohammed directed the October 2 killing. Ryan added if there is any reason to doubt these findings, Trump should immediately make that evidence public.\n\nTrump said the CIA never made a \"definitive\" conclusion about who was responsible.\n\nTuesday, November 20\n\nSenators demand 'determination' on MBS's role in Khashoggi murder\n\nHigh-ranking US senators called on Trump to investigate the part MBS played in Khashoggi's death after the CIA reportedly determined the killing was ordered by MBS.\n\n\"In light of recent developments, including the Saudi government's acknowledgement that Saudi officials killed Mr Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate, we request that your determination specifically address whether [MBS] is responsible for Mr Khashoggi's murder,\" Republican Bob Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez wrote in their letter to Trump, sent on Tuesday.\n\nCorker is the chairman and Menendez the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nUnder the Magnitsky Act, a law which empowers the US government to investigate human rights abuses, the president is required \"to determine whether a foreign person\" has committed a \"gross violation\" of human rights against any individual, including extrajudicial murder.\n\nThe act also allows the US government to sanction individuals should it be determined they committed human rights violations.\n\nTrump has said there will be no further punitive action against Saudi Arabia, citing arms deals and the kingdom's role as \"a great ally in our very important fight against Iran\".\n\nTurkey demands clarification on Khashoggi killing: Cavusoglu\n\nTurkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara may seek a formal United Nations inquiry over Khashoggi's killing if its liaising with Riyadh comes to an impasse.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, Cavusoglu said Turkey is not entirely satisfied with the level of cooperation it is receiving from Saudi Arabia over the case.\n\n\"Whoever gave the instruction should be held accountable... Whoever committed this crime should be brought to justice,\" he said.\n\nRepeating Ankara's position that the truth had to come out on who ordered the journalist's killing, Cavusoglu said his country had shared the latest information with the US.\n\nTrump says open to MBS meeting at G20 summit\n\nPresident Trump has said he is prepared to meet Prince Mohammed at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month.\n\nPress reports have linked MBS to the killing of Khashoggi, with US media reporting that the CIA has concluded that he ordered the assassination of the Washington Post columnist. The Saudi government has repeatedly denied the claim.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday shortly after releasing a statement in which he promised that the US would remain a \"steadfast partner\" of Saudi Arabia, Trump said the CIA report into Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents found \"nothing definitive\".\n\n\"The CIA looked at it,\" he said at the White House. \"They have nothing definitive.\"\n\nHis comments came as leading Democrats in Congress criticised Trump for failing to take action against Prince Mohammed and called for cuts to Washington's support to Riyadh.\n\nIran's Zarif says Trump's Khashoggi statement 'shameful'\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that US President Donald Trump's statement that Washington will stand by Riyadh despite Khashoggi's murder is \"shameful\".\n\nIn his statement, Trump also took aim at Iran, saying the country \"is considered 'the world's leading sponsor of terror'.\"\n\nIn response, Zarif wrote on Twitter: \"Mr. Trump bizarrely devotes the FIRST paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse IRAN of every sort of malfeasance he can think of.

There's overwhelming consensus that the leadership is involved - no one is debating it within the government,\" the official told ABC News on condition of anonymity on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the official acknowledged that the words \"probably\" and \"likely\" are used when attributing the death to MBS, ABC News reported, adding that the source noted that CIA analysis reports rarely include explicit conclusions.\n\nPompeo handed Riyadh plan to shield MBS: Middle East Eye\n\nSaudi Arabia's king and crown prince are shielding themselves from the Khashoggi murder scandal using a plan drawn up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a senior Saudi source told Middle East Eye.\n\nPompeo delivered the plan in person during a meeting with Saudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, last month in Riyadh, said the source, who is familiar with the official's talks with the Saudi leaders.\n\nThe plan includes an option to pin the Saudi journalist's murder on an innocent member of the ruling Al Saud family in order to insulate those at the very top, the source told MEE.\n\nThat person has not yet been chosen, the source said, and Saudi leaders are reserving the use of that plan in case the pressure on MBS becomes too much.\n\nThe US State Department denied the Saudi source's allegations and called them \"a complete misrepresentation of the secretary's diplomatic mission to Saudi Arabia\".\n\nTrump under pressure to release Khashoggi murder report\n\nPresident Trump is facing increasing pressure to take tougher measures against Saudi Arabia before the expected release of an official report into the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nTrump told reporters on Saturday that a detailed report including information about who was responsible for the murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul would be released \"probably on Monday or Tuesday\".\n\nAccording to US media, the CIA has concluded that Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto leader, ordered Khashoggi's killing.\n\nTrump has called the reports \"premature\" saying he's not convinced that MBS was directly responsible for the October 2 slaying of the writer.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir rejected media reports that the CIA believes MBS ordered the killing of Khashoggi and said Turkish statements on the matter were not referring to him.\n\n\"We in the kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in truth and we categorically reject them, whether through leaks or not,\" Jubeir said in an interview with Asharq al-Awsat newspaper in remarks published on Tuesday.\n\n\"They are leaks that have not been officially announced, and I have noticed that they are based on an assessment, not conclusive evidence,\" he added.\n\nMembers of Saudi Arabia's ruling family are agitating to prevent Prince Mohammed from becoming king after the international uproar over the killing of Khashoggi, sources close to the royal court told Reuters news agency.\n\nSenior US officials, meanwhile, indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks they would support Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz - who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years - as a potential successor to King Salman, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThe dozens of powerful princes and cousins from the Al Saud family who want a change in the line of succession will not act while King Salman - the crown prince's 82-year-old father - is alive, sources said.\n\nThey recognise the king is unlikely to turn against his favourite son, the report added. Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king's death, Prince Ahmed, 76, uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nClick here for all previous updates"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Rwandan court drops charges against opposition politician Rwigara", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/rwandan-court-drops-charges-opposition-politician-rwigara-181206154419075.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:13", "body_paragraphs": "A Rwandan court acquitted Diane Rwigara, a critic of veteran President Paul Kagame, on charges that included inciting insurrection and the forgery of documents.\n\nRwigara, 37, was arrested in September 2017 after her attempt to run in Rwanda's presidential election was denied on grounds she allegedly forged the signatures of supporters for her bid.\n\nShe was also charged with inciting insurrection for comments criticising the government and Kagame in the run-up to the election.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Intelligence Not Shocked North Korea Upgrading Missile Bases", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-intelligence-not-shocked-north-korea-upgrading-missile-bases/4689513.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "North Korean efforts to upgrade and expand a long-range missile base come as no surprise to U.S. intelligence officials, who have long been wary of promises by Pyongyang to denuclearize.\n\nNew satellite imagery shows what appears to be improvements to the Yeongjeo-dong missile base, a facility located in North Korea\u2019s mountainous interior, as well as work on a new facility, Hoejung-ri, 11 kilometers (seven miles) away.\n\n\"Our analytical line has not changed\u201d a U.S. intelligence official told VOA, when asked about the images. \u201cNorth Korea has a big job to do.

He was forced to resign after news surfaced that he had lied to administration officials about his talks with Sergey Kislyak, former Russian ambassador to Washington, during the presidential transition.\n\nFlynn had drawn investigators' scrutiny before he ran afoul of the FBI in January 2017. While serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, he lobbied for a Dutch company linked to the Turkish government without registering as a foreign agent.\n\n\n\nFlynn began cooperating with the special counsel after pleading guilty to lying to federal agents about his conversations with Kislyak. He became the first of five former Trump associates who have entered guilty pleas with the special counsel's office.\n\n\n\nThe sentencing recommendation by Mueller, if approved by a federal judge later this month, could spell an end to Flynn\u2019s legal troubles. Sentencing is set for Dec. 18.\n\nBut as part of his agreement with the special counsel, Flynn is required to testify \u201cat any and all trials\u201d where his testimony is deemed relevant.\n\nVon Spakovsky said that while the Mueller investigation remains cloaked in secrecy, it is unlikely to wrap up by year\u2019s end and could well drag on as late as next spring. He said he expects the special counsel to write a report on his findings at some point next year without issuing any major indictments.\n\nTrump recently provided the special counsel with written answers about his knowledge of the Russian interference, raising speculation that Mueller's team may have received what they need to complete their report.\n\nBut recent developments in the probe paint a different picture.\n\nLast week, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, and prosecutors revealed that Cohen had spent 70 hours in interviews with investigators.\n\nOn Friday, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are expected to disclose how former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u201crepeatedly lied\u201d to them in recent weeks in breach of a cooperation agreement.\n\n\u201cSo all of that tells me that this is very complicated, that there is more to come,\u201d said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University School of Public Affairs. \"I would not expect Mueller\u2019s investigation or the other investigations that are referred to in the Flynn sentencing memo to end anytime soon. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get more information, but I don\u2019t see things wrapping up.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Weighs In on Climate Change", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-weighs-in-on-climate-change/4687607.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "\"I'm not going to put the country out of business trying to maintain certain standards that probably don't matter,\" President Donald Trump told VOA when asked about the economic impacts of climate change.\n\n\n\nWhen not denying its existence, the Trump administration's approach to\n\nclimate change essentially comes down to three arguments: the United States has already cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than other countries, regardless of any international agreement; regulations to cut emissions come with high costs and few benefits; and those regulations would put the United States at a disadvantage because other countries will not follow.\n\n\"When you look at China, and when you look at other countries where they have foul air,\" Trump added, \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money.\"\n\n\n\nAs U.N. climate negotiations get under way in Poland to work out rules for implementing the Paris climate agreement -- from which Trump intends to withdraw the United States -- experts weigh in on the administration's claims.\n\nEmissions cuts\n\n\n\nIt's true that the United States has reduced its greenhouse gas production more than any other country. U.S. emissions peaked in 2005. In the last decade, they have fallen by about 13 percent, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n\n\nBut the United States was the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases until 2006. And, others have made bigger cuts by percentage. Hungary's levels, for example, decreased 14 percent.\n\n\n\nU.S. emissions started to fall when the fracking boom took off.\n\n\n\nThe new technique of hydraulic fracturing turned the United States into a major natural gas producer. As the price of natural gas has dropped, it has been steadily replacing coal as the dominant fuel for electricity generation. Because burning natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased.\n\n\n\nMore recently, renewable sources such as solar and wind power have started to make inroads on the power grid.\n\nWhile U.S. emissions have fallen since the 2000s, China's have soared.\n\n\n\nThe country pursued astonishing economic growth with an enormous investment in coal-fired power plants. China is now the leading producer of greenhouse gases by far, roughly doubling U.S. output.\n\n\n\nCost-benefit\n\nTrump has argued that regulations aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions would hobble the U.S. economy. He has moved to undo the Obama administration's proposed rules on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, among others.\n\n\n\nCritics question whether those regulations would cost as much Trump suggests.\n\n\n\n\"None of these policies were going to have dramatic increases in the prices that consumers would see,\" Duke University public policy professor Billy Pizer said. He added that normal price swings would likely swamp the cost of the regulations Trump targets.\n\nThe emissions reductions the Obama administration pledged in Paris \"were built largely on a continuation of the coal-to-gas transition and a continuation of growth in renewable energy that's already happening,\" said Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute research center. As such, he added, they \"don't imply a large cost. In fact, they imply a marginal increased benefit to the U.S.\"\n\n\n\nThose benefits come, for example, because burning less coal produces less air pollution, which lowers health costs.\n\n\n\nNot to mention the direct results of climate change: wildfires, floods, droughts and so on.\n\n\n\n\"We have enough science and enough economics to show that there are damages resulting from us releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. We know that that is not a free thing,\" University of Chicago public policy professor Amir Jina said. \"And yet, we are artificially setting it as free because we're not paying the price of that externality.\"\n\n\n\nHe said economists nearly unanimously support a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program or some other way to put a price on carbon emissions.\n\nCollective action\n\nFew nations have taken the necessary steps to meet the emissions reduction pledges they made in Paris, according to the most recent United Nations emissions gap report.\n\nEven those pledges would fall far short of the Paris goal of limiting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, the report adds. Reaching that target will take \"unprecedented and urgent action.\" A 2016 report said an additional $5.2 trillion investment in renewable energy will be necessary worldwide over the next 25 years.\n\n\n\nTrump's statement -- \"we're going to be clean, but they're not, and it costs a lot of money\" -- sums up why nations are reluctant to act: no one wants to take on burdens that they think others won't.\n\n\n\n\"It's the thing which has been dogging action on climate change for generations,\" Jina said.\n\n\n\n\"We only really solve the problem if everybody acts together,\" he added. \"And if enough people are not acting, then we don't.\"\n\n\n\nParis depends on countries following through on increasingly ambitious emissions cuts.\n\n\n\nEach country decides what it is willing to do. Every five years, countries come together and show their progress.\n\n\n\n\"You over time build confidence in each other,\" Pizer said. \"Ideally, you ratchet up the commitments as you see your actions reciprocated by other countries.\"\n\nTrump's backpedaling on the U.S. commitment raises questions about the prospects.\n\n\n\nHowever, the first of these check-ins is five years away. Trump can't formally withdraw the United States from the agreement until 2020.\n\n\n\nPizer notes that the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, failed in part because it imposed caps on countries' carbon emissions, and most of the world balked.\n\n\n\n\"In my mind, this is the best we can do,\" he said. \"If there were a different way to do it, I'd be all over that.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Nation Pauses Wednesday to Mourn Former US President George H.W.

The map will be freely available to all.\n\n\u201cWe obviously need a lot of cooperation from different parties, individuals as well as private companies,\u201d said Mao Hasebe, project coordinator at the Nippon Foundation, a Japanese philanthropic organization supporting the initiative. \u201cWe think it\u2019s ambitious, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Hasebe said.\n\nThe project, which launched in 2017, is expected to cost about $3 billion. It is a collaboration between the Nippon Foundation and GEBCO, a nonprofit association of experts that is already involved in charting the ocean floor.\n\nThe result would be greater knowledge of the oceans\u2019 biodiversity, improved understanding of the climate, advanced warning of impending disasters, and the ability to better protect or exploit deep-sea resources, Hasebe said.\n\n\u200bRecent advances\n\nSo far, the biggest data contributors to Seabed 2030 have been companies, in particular Dutch energy prospector Fugro and deep-sea mapping firm Ocean Infinity. Both were involved in the search for the Malaysian airliner MH370, which disappeared in 2014.\n\nTo map the ocean floor, high-tech multibeam echosounders transmit a fan of acoustic beams from a ship, which ping back depending on the depth and topography of the ocean floor. That creates data points, which can be converted into a map.\n\n\u201cWith advanced sonar technology, it really is like seeing. I think we\u2019ve come out of the era of being the blind man with the stick,\u201d said Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n\u201cWe can survey much more efficiently, and, not only that, but in much greater detail,\u201d he said, adding that the work was painstaking. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s a big place!\u201d he said.\n\nThe advent of new technology, such as underwater drones and robots, is also speeding up the mapping process.\n\nA global competition hosted by energy giant Shell, the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, is also under way, offering $7 million to teams that can develop technologies to conduct ocean exploration autonomously, rapidly and to a high resolution.\n\nA team from Seabed 2030 has reached the final stages of the competition with an idea based on remotely operated robots working in extreme depths to map territory independently.\n\nEconomic benefits\n\nExploring Earth\u2019s final frontier will do more than satisfy scientific curiosity, it should bring economic benefits, too.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the world\u2019s trade is carried by sea, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a U.N. body, making safe navigation a key motivator for mapping.\n\n\u201cIf a ship runs aground it\u2019s a terrible day for the economy, it\u2019s a terrible day for the environment and it\u2019s a bad day for the captain, too,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nSeabed 2030\u2019s map would have other benefits, experts said: In a warming world, it would provide a better idea of sea levels as ice melts and, importantly, warn about impending tsunamis that could devastate coastal communities.\n\nThey said it would also help the so-called \u201cblue economy\u201d as countries and companies seek to protect or exploit deep-sea resources, from exploring for oil and gas to installing wind farms or laying fiber-optic cables for the internet.\n\nThat is predicted to become more important in the coming years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It expects the ocean economy to contribute $3 trillion to the world economy by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2010.\n\nPolitical rifts\n\nSome parts of the oceans \u2014 the East Coast of the United States, areas around Japan, New Zealand and Ireland \u2014 are relatively well-mapped, experts said. Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans \u2014 mapping will take center stage during negotiations to be completed by 2020, as nations create a new, legally binding treaty to protect the high seas.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits to knowing more about the ocean floor,\u201d Hasebe said. \u201cHumanity as a whole would be able to benefit.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Report: Greenhouse Gas Emissions to Set Record", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/report-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-set-record/4688468.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Emissions of planet-warming gases will hit an all-time high this year, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures are the latest indication of how far the world is from meeting the goal set out in Paris in 2015 to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.\n\nThe report comes as U.N. negotiators meet in Poland for the latest round of talks on confronting climate change.\n\nEmissions are projected to rise 2.7 percent this year, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions.

The map will be freely available to all.\n\n\u201cWe obviously need a lot of cooperation from different parties, individuals as well as private companies,\u201d said Mao Hasebe, project coordinator at the Nippon Foundation, a Japanese philanthropic organization supporting the initiative. \u201cWe think it\u2019s ambitious, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Hasebe said.\n\nThe project, which launched in 2017, is expected to cost about $3 billion. It is a collaboration between the Nippon Foundation and GEBCO, a nonprofit association of experts that is already involved in charting the ocean floor.\n\nThe result would be greater knowledge of the oceans\u2019 biodiversity, improved understanding of the climate, advanced warning of impending disasters, and the ability to better protect or exploit deep-sea resources, Hasebe said.\n\n\u200bRecent advances\n\nSo far, the biggest data contributors to Seabed 2030 have been companies, in particular Dutch energy prospector Fugro and deep-sea mapping firm Ocean Infinity. Both were involved in the search for the Malaysian airliner MH370, which disappeared in 2014.\n\nTo map the ocean floor, high-tech multibeam echosounders transmit a fan of acoustic beams from a ship, which ping back depending on the depth and topography of the ocean floor. That creates data points, which can be converted into a map.\n\n\u201cWith advanced sonar technology, it really is like seeing. I think we\u2019ve come out of the era of being the blind man with the stick,\u201d said Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n\u201cWe can survey much more efficiently, and, not only that, but in much greater detail,\u201d he said, adding that the work was painstaking. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s a big place!\u201d he said.\n\nThe advent of new technology, such as underwater drones and robots, is also speeding up the mapping process.\n\nA global competition hosted by energy giant Shell, the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, is also under way, offering $7 million to teams that can develop technologies to conduct ocean exploration autonomously, rapidly and to a high resolution.\n\nA team from Seabed 2030 has reached the final stages of the competition with an idea based on remotely operated robots working in extreme depths to map territory independently.\n\nEconomic benefits\n\nExploring Earth\u2019s final frontier will do more than satisfy scientific curiosity, it should bring economic benefits, too.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the world\u2019s trade is carried by sea, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a U.N. body, making safe navigation a key motivator for mapping.\n\n\u201cIf a ship runs aground it\u2019s a terrible day for the economy, it\u2019s a terrible day for the environment and it\u2019s a bad day for the captain, too,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nSeabed 2030\u2019s map would have other benefits, experts said: In a warming world, it would provide a better idea of sea levels as ice melts and, importantly, warn about impending tsunamis that could devastate coastal communities.\n\nThey said it would also help the so-called \u201cblue economy\u201d as countries and companies seek to protect or exploit deep-sea resources, from exploring for oil and gas to installing wind farms or laying fiber-optic cables for the internet.\n\nThat is predicted to become more important in the coming years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It expects the ocean economy to contribute $3 trillion to the world economy by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2010.\n\nPolitical rifts\n\nSome parts of the oceans \u2014 the East Coast of the United States, areas around Japan, New Zealand and Ireland \u2014 are relatively well-mapped, experts said. Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans \u2014 mapping will take center stage during negotiations to be completed by 2020, as nations create a new, legally binding treaty to protect the high seas.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits to knowing more about the ocean floor,\u201d Hasebe said. \u201cHumanity as a whole would be able to benefit.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Australian Bid for Encrypted Data Passes First Hurdle", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-bid-for-encrypted-data-passes-first-hurdle/4688991.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "The Australian parliament\u2019s lower house Thursday passed a bill to force tech firms such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook and Apple to give police access to encrypted data, pushing it closer to becoming a precedent-setting law.\n\nHowever, the proposal, staunchly opposed by the tech giants because Australia is seen as a test case as other nations explore similar rules, faces a sterner test in the upper house Senate, where privacy and information security concerns are sticking points.\n\nThe bill provides for fines of up to A$10 million ($7.3 million) for institutions and prison terms for individuals for failing to hand over data linked to suspected illegal activities.\n\nLabor party concerns\n\nEarlier in the week it appeared set to secure enough support from both major political parties, with some amendments, to secure passage.

Yet while the country is scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019, Britain is as divided over the issue as it ever has been.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has agreed the terms of the \u2018divorce\u2019 with the leaders of the EU\u2019s remaining member states, but lawmakers in the British parliament still have to approve the so-called Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nIn ordinary times, a Conservative government with a simple majority would be able to get the deal through the House of Commons with little fuss.\n\nBut these are extraordinary times. May cannot rely on the support from members of parliament in her own party \u2013 much less Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been propping up May\u2019s minority government since her disastrous general election last year.\n\nPress Association Will Theresa May quit? Could Jeremy Corbyn become Prime Minister?\n\nAs it stands, as May bizarrely takes her Brexit plan around the country as if on the election trail, no commentator in the country expects the prime minister to get enough support when MPs vote on December 11. The only question, it seems, is how heavily she is defeated.\n\nThen what? That\u2019s where things get more unpredictable, with the outcomes ranging wildly from the prospect of another general election to no Brexit at all.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to what will be a historic week in British politics, however it ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nOn Tuesday, MPs began five days of debates ahead of what is described as the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement they are debating outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. The vote is expected on December 11, but even that isn\u2019t set in stone. Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\n\nWill May get enough votes?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSome 20 Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against May\u2019s deal, 45 have said they will not vote in favour and more than 20 have said they are unhappy with it. Their unease comes from, as they see it, the agreement aligning the UK too closely with the EU, and they claim May is set to deliver a Brexit in name only.\n\nGiven that May doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament, she will be relying on support from opposition parties. May\u2019s minority government ally, the DUP, who usually vote with the government to help them pass legislation, has also expressed its own concerns with how the deal risks separating the island of Ireland from the mainland as a trading territory.\n\nThe Labour Party, the official opposition, has also declined to approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the have concerns about the impact on jobs and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe bottom line is this: the chance of the deal being approved with the simple majority of 320 of the 639 MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat are the amendments?\n\nThe vote - or votes - may not be limited to the terms of May\u2019s deal. Labour has tabled an amendment outlining how MPs will \u201cpursue every option\u201d that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of May\u2019s deal or leaving without any deal at all.\n\nTory and Labour backbenchers have also put forward something similar, and there appears to be united front against the UK quitting the EU without any deal - or what is colloquially referred to as \u2018crashing out\u2019.\n\nIndeed, on the first day of debates, MPs voted for a motion that means if May\u2019s Brexit is voted down next week, MPs can effectively instruct ministers on what to do next and amend her \u201cplan B\u201d option.\n\nPress Association\n\nWhat happens if she wins the vote?\n\nIn the unlikely event that scores of MPs from across the political spectrum swing behind the embattled prime minister, it will allow the government to introduce the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to the Commons either before Christmas or after recess (the holiday for parliament), in January.\n\nWhile no guarantee of the legislation passing, it would suggest an orderly procession towards the EU exit doors.\n\nWhat happens if she loses the vote?\n\nYou would expect Theresa May\u2019s premiership to be over, right? While that\u2019s a likely outcome, it is not the only one. These are the most likely scenarios.\n\n\u2013 She could try again\n\nThis would depend on the margin of her defeat.\n\nThe European Union has been adamant this is a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 deal that cannot be renegotiated. But if faced with the threat of a calamitous no-deal Brexit and following a narrow Commons defeat, May might fancy testing their resolve and seeing if she can get at least some cosmetic changes to appease enough MPs to win a second vote.\n\n\u2013 Theresa May quits\n\nMay herself has been adamant that she will stay on as prime minister regardless of the result. But a defeat by something in the order of 200 votes - which would represent a rebellion by scores of her own MPs - and it could be the most elegant way out.\n\n\u2013 May forced out by a Conservative rebellion\n\nConservative MPs most strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal have already failed to oust May, struggling to muster enough support to trigger a leadership battle two weeks ago. But once the vote is over, other disgruntled Tory politicians could make their move.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum\n\nYes, taking the deal to the public is an option. May has ruled it out, and Labour has backed the idea - but only if they do not get a general election. It would possibly require an extension to the two-year timeframe to agree a Brexit deal, but even a senior Conservative has suggested another referendum could logistically be held by the end of May (the month, that is).\n\n\u2013 May calls another general election\n\nThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass. The Prime Minister could hope that voters will - via the ballot box - back her plan. Her fellow Conservatives are anxious to avoid this route after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament and a resurgent Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 Labour tries to force an election"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Luxembourg Announces Plan To Become First Country To Make All Public Transportation Free", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luxembourg-public-transportation_us_5c08d6ace4b069028dc685ac", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "In an effort to reduce traffic congestion and the environmental impact of cars, Luxembourg has announced its plan to become the first country in the world to make all its public transportation free.\n\nThe European country\u2019s recently re-elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has promised to lift fares on trains, trams and buses nationwide by summer 2019, The Guardian reported.\n\nAs the paper noted, however, some of the finer points of the plan have yet to be ironed out, including whether trains will still have first and second class compartments and if so, if riders will be charged in those cases.\n\nTraffic congestion is a major problem in Luxembourg, which receives approximately 170,000 cross-border commuters from neighboring France, Belgium and Germany on a daily basis.

Shortly before this year\u2019s election, Shipman says a woman came to her home and took her unsealed but filled-out absentee ballot, which is illegal in North Carolina. Then, a few days before Election Day, Shipman says the woman returned with a sealed ballot and stamps and asked her to turn it in. Shipman said she was suspicious, so she went to the polls on her own and decided to cast an in-person vote instead.\n\nState investigators are trying to figure out how many more people like Shipman were illegally asked to turn over their absentee ballots. If they find enough irregularities, they could choose to order a new election. HuffPost spoke with voters, including Shipman, whose absentee ballots weren\u2019t returned to election officials in Bladen County, the center of the investigation. Some were surprised to learn of the irregularities at all, while one woman said she was angry.\n\nShipman, who is black, submitted a written affidavit to the state board of elections through the state Democratic Party last week.

In Robeson, 62 percent were not returned, according to an analysis by Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College in North Carolina.\n\nBoth counties far exceeded the district\u2019s non-return rate of 24 percent. Bladen was the only county where Mark Harris, the Republican who won the congressional race, won the mail-in absentee vote. The non-return rate in the 9th District overall was the highest of any of the state\u2019s 13th congressional districts.\n\nIn recent days, three people have come forward to local television station WSOC and BuzzFeed News to say they were hired to collect absentee ballots, something that violates state law. All of those people have said they worked for McCrae Dowless, a campaign operative with a criminal history who was working for a contractor on behalf of Harris. Dowless did not respond to a request for an interview Wednesday.\n\nLisa Britt, Dowless\u2019 stepdaughter, told BuzzFeed she worked for Dowless but denied illegally taking absentee ballots. Britt signed as a witness on 44 absentee ballots and listed her address as a unit in an apartment complex called Village Oak. State records show 17 unreturned absentee ballots at the complex. A woman inside the address Britt listed on Wednesday refused to come to the door and said she had nothing to say.\n\nOne of the unreturned ballots at the Village Oak complex was from Miriam Bellamy. In an interview Wednesday at her home, she said she had mailed back her absentee ballot but had been given inconsistent information about how much postage to put on it. Bellamy, 57, said two women came to her door and offered to serve as the required witnesses for filling out an absentee ballot in the state. Bellamy said she took the women up on their offer but then sent the ballot in on her own. She seemed unaware of the larger investigation but nonetheless was angry that her vote apparently didn\u2019t make it to election officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mess. I voted for nothing. My vote don\u2019t count. Somebody stole my vote from me. I\u2019m thinking they stole mine, they got plenty of other people\u2019s, too,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is terrible.

The number of refugees and people fleeing violence or natural disasters has skyrocketed this year, and the topic has become a political hot point through Europe and the United States.\n\nBut these immigrant populations are beneficial to rich nations, the authors found, often traveling for an education or working in roles that contribute to local economies. In Britain, for example, 37 percent of doctors work with medical qualifications they received in another country.\n\n\u201cIn too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda,\u201d Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, said in a statement. \u201cMigrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come.

Fertility rates among migrant populations are also lower.\n\nMigrants do have increased rates of HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, but the report found the transmission of such ills to the general population was \u201cnegligible.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-06 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said.

One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems.
