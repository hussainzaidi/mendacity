Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sully the service dog to accompany Bush one last time", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nqFKdp1IFz0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Sully H.W.

In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.\n\nIn more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \"beast,\" a \"pac-man\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.\n\nCNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince.\n\n\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\"\n\nThis is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind.\n\nIs there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them\n\nArrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \"pac man\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows\n\nThe exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \"God help us,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo months later, he was dead.\n\nAbdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.\n\n\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \"The guilt is killing me.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSIM cards and financial support\n\nAbdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.\n\nIn almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following.\n\nThe digital offensive, dubbed the \"cyber bees,\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi's government's strongest weapon. \"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial $30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.\n\nIn one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\"\n\n\"Brilliant report,\" Khashoggi replies. \"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army\n\nJamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something.\n\nYou know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting.\n\nA month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first $5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up.\n\nBut in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.\n\n\"How did they know?\" asks Khashoggi in a message.\n\n\"There must have been a gap,\" says Abdulaziz.\n\nThree minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \"God help us.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe.\n\nJamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees?\n\nThe family's safety\n\nOmar Alzahrani I began to create groups\n\nI began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap\n\nTens of people must have been involved in this.\n\nCan you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees.\n\n!\n\nOtherwise I will go to prison\n\nJamal Khashoggi God help us.\n\nOmar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning.\n\nJamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective)\n\nDo not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram.\n\nThe 'hack'\n\nAbdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nMarczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.\n\nDanna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said.\n\nOn Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz.\n\nThe lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.\n\nIn a statement, NSO Group says its technology helps governments fight crime, and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government. \"Our products have a long track record of assisting governments in preventing suicide bombers, stopping drug lords and sex traffickers, and helping safely return victims of kidnapping,\" the statement said.\n\n\"If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,\" it adds.\n\nJamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington.\n\n'Tyranny has no logic'\n\nThe fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.\n\nThe messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.\n\n\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \"but tyranny has no logic.\"\n\nSuch discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing\n\nJamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament.\n\nAs Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.\n\n'Message from MBS'\n\nLast May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.\n\nSpeaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job.\n\n\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\" one of them says.\n\nAbdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.\n\nChillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qathani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"If Saud al Qathani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\" says one other man.\n\nThen they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.\n\nPoignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life.\n\n\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\"\n\nOn October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "France considers 'all options' to quell violent protests", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/9OH4R0YDNyY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) The French government is considering \"all options\" to control protests against rising fuel prices that have turned violent in Paris over the last three weeks, a spokesman said Sunday.\n\nSpeaking on France's Europe 1 radio, spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the government is thinking about steps to prevent \"serious outbursts of violence,\" including introducing a state of emergency.\n\nMore than 400 people were arrested and 133 injured in Paris on Saturday in clashes between police and protesters with the \"gilets jaune\" or \"yellow vest\" movement, who are protesting rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport.\n\nAn estimated 36,000 people demonstrated in Saturday's protests across the country, marking the third consecutive week of such demonstrations, according to the French Interior Ministry.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently referred to it as \" our black gold .\"\n\nThe country is the biggest producer of hard coal in the EU and coal power provides about 80% of Poland's electricity compared to an average of 30% among International Energy Agency member countries.\n\nBut coal accounts for almost half of global energy-related CO2 emissions, and like other coal-dependent countries, Poland is trying to adapt to a world that needs to cut emissions to slow global warming.\n\nThe EU has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030, and last week unveiled a plan to be net zero by 2050. Poland's CO2 emissions per capita are slightly above the EU average, but its emissions per GDP are third-highest in the EU.\n\nBut there are signs that is changing.\n\nA coal-fired power station in Bogatynia, Poland.\n\nMarek W\u0105si\u0144ski, an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, a government-funded think tank, told CNN: \"Like other EU countries, Poland is also moving away from coal. It's not a revolution, it's a slow evolution of the energy sector.\"\n\nAlthough it makes up less than 10% of its energy mix, Poland has around 6,000 megawatts of wind power capacity, putting it among the leading nations in the EU.\n\nConstruction of the Baltic Pipe Project is set to start in 2020, which will supply natural gas from Norway to Poland. Natural gas produces much less CO2 than coal when it's burned for energy, but methane leakage can limit its climate benefits.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy's draft energy policy, published last week, said that by 2030, 60% of power will come from coal. It expects to have up to 9,000 MW of nuclear power by 2043, and 30,000 MW of off-shore wind and solar power by 2040.\n\nCoal legacy\n\nMicha\u0142 Kurtyka, COP 24 President and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment, told CNN that Poland inherited a legacy of coal from its decades in the Eastern Bloc -- which ended in 1989 -- but had since managed to successfully transition its economy.\n\n\"In 1990 the Polish energy mix was 96% coal,\" he said. \"There was a very high share of employment in coal and very big industrial production, the result of this communist conviction that only through industrialization could the Soviet Bloc compete with Western economies.\n\n\"When we entered into the transformation phase, this idea of transition of employment and changing industrial structure in many industrial regions, but starting with Silesia, was a very big challenge, but it's working very well right now.\n\n\"Katowice is an example of the transformation.

They shared a business, vacationed together and settled about 11 miles from each other in the suburbs of New Jersey.\n\nBut two days before Thanksgiving, a horrific chain of events would forever tear them apart. Even more horrific is the identity of the alleged perpetrator of those events.\n\nPaul Caneiro, 51, is accused of killing his younger brother, his sister-in-law and their children in their modern Colts Neck Township mansion in the early morning darkness on November 20 and then setting their home on fire -- an attempt, authorities say, to cover up the crimes.\n\nHe then allegedly set his own home on fire -- with his wife and daughters inside -- to try to make it look as if the whole family was being targeted. His family got out of the home safely, officials said.\n\nThe slayings have shocked the community and several twists in the case have rattled law enforcement. In just a few days, the odd coincidence -- two fires on the same day in the homes of two brothers -- revealed what prosecutors said was one of the most brutal crimes they'd ever seen.\n\nFriends and relatives will give Keith Caneiro and his family a final farewell on Sunday, as Paul Caneiro, who maintains his innocence, sits in a Monmouth County jail, awaiting trial.\n\nFamily of four was killed before sunrise\n\nSometime between midnight and 5 a.m., authorities said, Paul Caneiro was walking around his brother's $1.5 million Colts Neck home armed with a knife and a gun.\n\nThe brothers had been in front of the white mansion when a deadly confrontation unfolded. Paul fired multiple shots, striking Keith, officials say.\n\nIt's unclear if they exchanged words or had a fight, but the sound of the gunshots apparently went unnoticed in this upscale town of about 10,000 people around 50 miles south of New York.\n\nPaul then walked inside the home and found Keith's wife, Jennifer. He shot and stabbed her and also stabbed their children, Jesse, 11, and Sophia, 8, Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said.\n\nHe then took some documents and set a fire in the basement, officials said.\n\nSuspect set his own home on fire\n\nWhen Paul left his brother's house that morning, he went to his home in Ocean Township, still under the cover of darkness. He poured gasoline outside his two-story home while his family slept inside and ignited it, a criminal complaint alleges.\n\nBy 5 a.m., firefighters and police were on their way to Paul's home. Someone had called 911, saying they'd seen smoke.\n\nA fire started at Paul Caneiro's home in Ocean Township while the family was sleeping. They escaped were unharmed.\n\nWhen first responders arrived, Paul, his wife and their daughters were already outside. They were unharmed.\n\nA fire was burning behind the residence and a smaller fire was located near the garage door.\n\nPaul Caneiro put his family in danger, Gramiccioni said, when he tried to destroy the evidence he brought with him from his brother's home and tried to make it seem like both families were being targeted.\n\nPaul's attorney, Robert A. Honecker, said Paul helped his family evacuate after a fire broke out at their home and waited with them until police and firefighters arrived.\n\nHours later, the family went to the town's police headquarters, where all of them were questioned. Paul would remain there for the next 12 hours until he was arrested around midnight.\n\nKillings were hidden by flames\n\nBack at the Colts Neck mansion, a fire was growing hotter and hotter, scorching the rooms of the more than 5,700-square-foot home.\n\nIt was a normal day on quiet Willow Brook Road, where Keith's mansion stood out from the others because of its modern architecture. As the sun rose, children took off on buses for the last full day of classes before Thanksgiving, and adults began commuting to work.\n\nJust after 12:30 p.m., more than six hours after the fire at Paul Caneiro's home, dozens of firefighters responded to the 1-acre property. A neighbor's groundskeeper had smelled smoke coming from the home and his boss called 911, the Asbury Park Press reported.\n\nFirefighters contained the fire about 24 hours after it was reported.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived, they made a gruesome discovery. Keith was dead in front of the home, while the bodies of the rest of the family were severely burned inside.\n\nPlumes of smoke poured out of the home as fire crews saturated the structure and the lawn around it. They wouldn't put down the fire until about a day later, and they wouldn't let investigators inside, fearing -- among other safety concerns -- that the roof could cave in.\n\nATF is currently lending our technical expertise to the investigation led by @MonCoProsecutor and @MonmouthPDFDEMS of an arson with multiple fatalities in Colts Neck, NJ. pic.twitter.com/lHe3x2xf5w \u2014 ATF Newark (@ATF_Newark) November 21, 2018\n\nWithin hours, investigators announced the family had been targeted and were victims of homicide.\n\nPaul Caneiro sat in jail, accused of setting his own home on fire. And suspicions were increasing that he was involved in the deaths of his brother and his family.\n\nMore than a week later, Paul was accused of the killings. He now faces four counts of murder, two counts of aggravated arson and two firearm violations, records show.\n\nIf convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nProsecutors have said he acted alone and have no reason to believe that organized crime was involved.\n\nMoney broke their 'best friends' relationship\n\nThe troubles between the Caneiro brothers may have involved money.\n\nThey worked together for three decades, after Keith founded a technology consulting company and brought Paul on as his first employee.\n\nThe company appeared to be very successful, adding Wall Street names such as Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to their clients list through the years.\n\nPaul Caneiro made his first appearance in a Monmouth County on Friday.\n\n\"By the time the internet bubble was about to burst in 2001, their technology business had grown to $4.5 million in annual sales and 26 employees,\" the Asbury Park Press newspaper reported.\n\nAnother sign of their partnership was the company's name, Jay-Martin Consulting, which combined the brothers' middle names. Later, they would rename the firm Square One.\n\nBefore the killings, the Caneiros had been operating the tech firm alongside a pest control company out of a brick building on a main road in Asbury Park, according to the city's public records.\n\nThe motive in the killings was financial, prosecutors say, and stemmed from the brothers' joint business ventures. Authorities have not discussed any more details about the motive but have said investigators have launched an investigation into the Caneiro's business dealings.\n\nPaul Caneiro's attorneys, Robert Honecker and Mitchell Ansell, said their client was wrongfully accused and that he \"had absolutely nothing to do with these horrific crimes.\"\n\n\"Paul's family means more to him than anything else in the world,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\"There is absolutely no reason in the world for Paul Caneiro to have committed the crimes he is alleged to have committed. He would never hurt any member of his family. The process today can begin for a search for the truth and who committed these horrendous acts.\"\n\nThe brothers not only worked together, the attorneys said, they considered themselves best friends and were each other's best man at their weddings.\n\nA loving family led by a tech businessman\n\nCandles, photos and flowers have slowly filled the steps of the Colts Neck Town Hall to mourn a loving family who enjoyed traveling to Greece and exercising together.\n\nKeith wanted to keep developing his career and had just earned a master's degree in technology management from Columbia University in New York.\n\nIn his thesis, he focused on technology that could \"solve world hunger by matching excess foods with hungry people,\" he wrote in his LinkedIn profile.\n\nTributes hung on a fence in front of the Colts Neck mansion.\n\nHe was committed to exercising and was a regular at a local gym, according to his obituary. His trainer, Brian Bott, wrote on Facebook that Keith, who was initially introverted, made jokes, took over the radio and overall made other people felt like they belonged there.\n\n\"If you trained in the morning here you knew Keith. He had that way about him. Keith was an 'idea' guy and I think it's why him and I got along so well,\" Bott wrote. \"We'd talk about business, music, movies, or anything really, but I sincerely enjoyed my conversations with him and the way they would challenge me intellectually.\"\n\nA video posted on the gym's Facebook page shows Caneiro doing push-ups while his young daughter helps out, providing a little extra weight on his back.\n\nKeith was also an avid reader, reading multiple books in a week, and loved sports.\n\nLike her husband, Jennifer Caneiro enjoyed exercising, going to the beach and traveling with the family to their home in Greece, her obituary says.\n\nFriends and family of Keith Caneiro and his family gathered outside the Colts Neck Town Hall for a candlelight vigil honoring last week.\n\nShe was a graduate of the University of Albany and a member of the parent-teacher organization at her children's school. She enjoyed hosting family parties \"for every holiday at her home.\"\n\nThe couple's daughter, Sophia, was a third-grader and a Girl Scout who loved Ninja classes. She enjoyed baking cookies, ice skating, gymnastics and the New York Yankees.\n\n\"Sophia was a vibrant, enthusiastic and precocious girl, who enjoyed the arts. Her positive energy was contagious,\" according to her obituary.\n\nSon Jesse was a fifth-grader with an impressive knowledge of world events. He knew everything about the two World Wars and could engage anyone in conversations about current world events.

But it's better than the situation we had before. Now we wait and see.\"\n\nSaturday's agreement on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina set up yet another deadline by the Trump administration to broker a deal with China to address top US concerns like forced technology transfer, intellectual property and cyber-theft within 90 days.\n\nIt's unclear exactly when that clock would start, but it's anticipated to jump-start a series of fast, intense negotiations between both countries to work out the details of a broad strokes agreement brokered by the two presidents over a two-and-a-half hour steak dinner.\n\n\"The hard work begins now,\" said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs for the US Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.\n\nThe statements issued by the two sides, while each positive, illuminated how far apart Washington and Beijing remain despite each country's leader boasting about their strong personal relationship.\n\nThe starkest difference was the omission in China's statement of any agreed upon timetable for negotiations.\n\nAlso absent was specific mention of what markets China would be inclined to open up -- like agriculture, energy and industrial US products -- three sectors touted by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in her brief statement on Saturday.\n\nTrump repeatedly referred to agriculture -- a flag, perhaps, to US soybean farmers who have been the first to feel pain from Chinese retaliation. \"China will be buying massive amounts of product from us, including agricultural, from our farmers -- tremendous amount of agricultural and other products,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Going down the line, you can see what was left ambiguous,\" said Allen, who viewed the absence of a joint statement as yet another signal of an unclear understanding from both sides.\n\nChina's statement also didn't mention Xi's willingness to consider approving a $44 billion deal for Qualcomm Inc. to purchase NXP Semiconductors NV, if the deal was put before him again -- a gesture the White House lauded as an achievement over dinner talks. In July, Qualcomm scrapped the proposed deal for its rival chip maker after waiting nearly two years for approval from Chinese regulators as tensions escalated between the two counties.\n\nThe one area of shared agreement between the two countries was on fentanyl, a substance that has been tied to an epidemic of overdose deaths in the United States, which been a top priority issue for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter years of negotiations dating back to President Barack Obama, China finally agreed to designate the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a controlled substance -- meaning sellers would be subject to the maximum penalty under the law. Officials in Washington believe China is the primary source of fentanyl found within US borders, following a 2017 US Congressional report citing law enforcement and drug investigators.\n\nThe President declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency last year and whatever the final arrangement on trade, a commitment from the Chinese to crack down on fentanyl would be a win he can point to for his Republican base. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who is overseeing the White House's opioid response, told reporters ahead of the President's trip that shipments of fentanyl, which has resulted in the deaths of 30,000 Americans last year, \"had to stop.\"\n\n\"That's like a plane falling from the sky every single day,\" she said.\n\nTwo powerful trade lobbies in Washington -- the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable -- which represent companies like Walmart Inc., Target Corp., and Procter & Gamble Company, welcomed the decision by the administration to set aside applying further tariffs as the \"right course of action.\"\n\nMore than 100 S&P companies have already pre-emptively telegraphed during third quarter earnings calls the damage further tariffs would impose on the US economy. Some companies like Walmart, the country's biggest retailer, have warned that prices on everyday goods like shampoo, detergents and paper goods like napkins will get more expensive for consumers.\n\nStill, analysts cast doubts over what was achievable over the next three months, suggesting it would be unlikely for both sides to reach a substantial breakthrough ahead of the next deadline.\n\n\"We've been here before,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist for Capital Economics in a research note, referring to a May deal negotiated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that included a pledge to buy more US energy and agricultural products, which the President ultimately vetoed. \"We suspect since he negotiated this deal himself, Trump will be much more reluctant to torpedo it when his own personal reputation is on the line.\"\n\nRoss was notably absent from the US delegation in Argentina, which included Trump's hardline China trade adviser Peter Navarro and top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer , s well as more moderate figures like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow.\n\nThe president was quick, once aboard Air Force One, to celebrate his negotiating prowess.\n\n\"It's a deal between the United States and China made by the President and the President,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut Trump acknowledged nothing is yet set in stone, adding, \"It goes down, certainly -- if it happens, it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made. China right now has major trade barriers -- they're major tariffs -- and also major non-tariff barriers, which are brutal. China will be getting rid of many of them.\"\n\nScott Kennedy, deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said to achieve successful negotiations, there would need to be \"clear consensus\" of the goals by the Trump administration and \"a more genuine interagency process.\" Such a shift would come after months of clear division within the President's cabinet between trade hawks like Navarro, and free traders like Mnuchin.\n\nIt will also befall China to set down a fresh starting point for negotiations in the weeks ahead as Beijing celebrates the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Such a moment, experts say, could offer Xi an opportunity to lay out a clear vision for a new wave of liberalization on his own terms based on the country's own needs and political schedule.\n\n\"But they won't take advantage of it in that way, and they could be back to the same period we were in three months,\" said Kennedy, referring to both countries governments."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Comey says he will testify after legal challenge", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Bo0w0V66J_M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that he would sit for a private deposition with House Republicans after filing a legal challenge to force a public hearing.\n\n\"Grateful for a fair hearing from judge.

She began questioning the world, her life and who she was. \"You start thinking, 'what species am I? Where do I belong?' \"\n\nThe announcement that she says changed her life was made by powerful politician Paul Makonda, regional governor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. At the end of October, he vowed to set up a task force to round up and arrest people suspected of being gay.\n\nShe first identified as a trans woman in 2016, having previously considered herself to be a gay man. \"It took courage,\" she said. \"Tanzania is a very religious country.\"\n\nAlthough she was \"very intelligent\" about coming out and about going only to known LGBT-friendly settings, she now feels that things have taken several steps back.\n\nFour weeks ago, she fled her home in Dar es Salaam to go to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, with the help of Kenya-based nongovernmental organization Jinsiangu, which is supported by the International AIDS Alliance and its Rapid Response Fund.\n\n\"It was so bad, I had go,\" she said. The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi.\n\n\"I'm free here,\" she said.\n\n'If you know any gays, report them to me'\n\nMakonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country, forcing many into hiding.\n\nStating that his phone number is widely known, \"I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays, report them to me,\" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.\n\nPaul Makonda, a politician in Tanzania, launched an anti-gay crackdown, threatening to arrest people suspected of being homosexuals.\n\nPeople already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J. Phillip King, a professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate.\n\nThe federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100.\n\nnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToda,y the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration.

Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink.

Hide Caption 6 of 6\n\nHe has since received an EPA grant of nearly $2 million to seek out water issues in towns like Enterprise.\n\nThe EPA and the federal government do offer grants and loans to towns. But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right? We're all neighbors we all know each other it's the human, right thing to do.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Destroyed: How the trashing of rape kits failed victims and jeopardizes public safety", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DPfoz5Rd6Cw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Editor\u2019s note These stories contain graphic language used in police documents on rape cases. CNN chose to quote directly from the documents rather than use vague or euphemistic language that fails to convey the violence of the crimes. Reporters were unable to identify and reach most victims because police redacted their names, addresses and other identifying information in the case files. Where police did not redact that information, CNN did, including the full names of suspects who were not charged.\n\nHours after you are raped, you sit in a hospital room, under fluorescent lights, and consent to a forensic exam. Your body is the crime scene. When did it happen, a nurse asks. Where did it happen? Can you tell me who did this to you? The nurse is trained to interview you and search your body for evidence left behind by your attacker. Knowing the details of your assault guides the examination. Did he ejaculate inside of you, on you? Where did he touch you? Did he use any objects? Did he kiss you, lick you? Have you had anything to drink? Did you shower? You\u2019re asked to undress slowly while you stand on a special sheet meant to collect any trace evidence that shakes loose. For three to five hours, the nurse swabs your mouth, your breasts, a bite mark on your neck. She scrapes under your fingernails, combs your pubic hair. She inserts a speculum inside you and drops blue dye on the tissue there to illuminate any places that are torn. The nurse cuts a hair from your head. She takes photographs of your face and shoulders to pair with your chart, of you in the clothes you wore when you were attacked. Every injury is photographed, too \u2014 far away, close-up, with a ruler to show size. When the exam is over, the nurse puts hair, fibers, swabs, vials of blood and urine in a container smaller than a shoebox. She seals it \u2014 your rape kit \u2014 and entrusts it to a police officer. This North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed. Read her full story here: \u2018They treated me like trash.\u2019 Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN This is the way DNA evidence is collected. This is what you endure so police can identify your assailant, make him pay for what he did. No one tells you that the exam may be pointless \u2014 that police might treat your kit like trash. A CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher and was arrived at through an analysis of the departments\u2019 own records. The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed. Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes. For the past several years, public attention has focused on the hundreds of thousands of kits that have languished untested. The Justice Department has awarded more than $150 million to test that backlog. But destruction of rape kits is a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The evidence is gone. It can never be used to lock up a rapist or set free the wrongfully convicted. Rape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN \u201cAll the attention toward untested kits isn\u2019t enough if we have agencies destroying kits,\u201d said Wayne County, Michigan, Prosecutor Kym Worthy, whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. \u201cEach one of these kits represents a victim,\u201d said the Detroit-based prosecutor. \u201cWhat you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\u201d What you are doing [\u2026] is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice. Kym Worthy | Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor A woman who reported being gang-raped in 2007 said it was \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d to recently learn that police destroyed her untested kit. She remembered the nurse at a hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, asking her to describe what the four men did so that her body could be positioned in a way that allowed for more precise examination. \u201cIt was very invasive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was very degrading. The level of exposure \u2026 was a second violation.\u201d But she steeled herself because the nurse was collecting evidence, and she believed police would test it and use it in their investigation. Instead, CNN found, the detective assigned to her case did nothing more than interview her. The officer never tried to talk to the men she named as her attackers, misinterpreted the law and concluded that no rape occurred. About a month after speaking with the woman, the detective authorized destruction of the untested rape kit \u2014 in a state where there was no time limit to prosecute rape. \u201cI counted on the police to do what they were supposed to do \u2014 to investigate what happened to me and to test that evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, they treated it like trash. They treated me like trash.\u201d For some victims, the rape exam feels like a second trauma. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Veteran sex crimes investigators, along with experts in the law, trauma and forensic science, reviewed case files for CNN. They said investigations indicated that police lacked training in how to interact with victims of sexual violence; in the importance of testing kits, not only to solve the reported assaults but potentially other crimes; and in the need to preserve kits for the length of time the law allows for a prosecution. \u201cWhat CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\u201d said Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant who ran the San Diego Police sex crimes unit for a decade. She examined 56 case files from more than a dozen departments. What CNN discovered is a systemic problem. Joanne Archambault | Former head of San Diego Police sex crimes unit \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 but it\u2019s not the norm \u2014 that law enforcement should keep evidence at least for the statute of limitations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are mistakes in these cases, but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\u201d Twenty-five agencies in 14 states destroyed kits tied to cases while they could still be prosecuted. Department leaders at some agencies defended the destruction by saying officers approved disposal of kits in closed cases they believed had no chance of moving forward. This was a routine process, they said, done to make space in evidence rooms. Who destroyed? Law enforcement agencies responded to CNN\u2019s findings. At least five departments acknowledged that the decision to destroy kits was made without considering the statutes of limitations. Three stopped trashing kits because of CNN\u2019s inquiries. Experts said the destruction shows that rape is treated differently than other violent crimes. \u201cWould we test all the evidence\u201d in a murder? \u201cYou bet,\u201d said police trainer Tom Tremblay. The former Vermont police chief, who has reviewed rape investigations for the US Department of Justice, examined cases from nine agencies. The language police sometimes used, he and other experts said, suggested bias \u2014 describing victims\u2019 accounts of their rapes as \u201chaving sex,\u201d asking whether victims experienced orgasms and focusing on a victim\u2019s behavior rather than the suspect\u2019s. All of it, Tremblay said, communicates one thing to a victim: You are not believed. Kym Worthy: The prosecutor is herself a rape survivor. She calls the destruction of rape kits a betrayal. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Worthy understands personally what\u2019s at stake. She isn\u2019t just a prosecutor; she\u2019s a survivor. She was raped in law school, she said, and \u2014 like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally \u2014 chose not to report her attack. It is a triumph, Worthy said, when a victim musters the courage to go to police and consent to a rape exam. And destroying a rape kit is a betrayal.\n\nDuring a life-threatening trauma like rape, the defense circuitry of the brain drives the victim\u2019s sole objective: to survive. Reflexes govern reaction \u2014 running away, punching the attacker, lying there paralyzed. Stress hormones can impair a victim\u2019s memory and the ability to make complex, rational decisions. Investigators trained in the effects of trauma know that a victim\u2019s first account of an assault may not be complete, experts said, and it may not be the best time to ask some questions. Yet documents CNN examined showed officers sometimes asked questions that threatened to overwhelm victims or put them on the defensive. Did you say no? Did you fight back? Why didn\u2019t you call police right away? Though experts say victims should be interviewed wherever they feel most comfortable, documents showed police sometimes ask them to come to the station, just as they do suspects. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A traumatized person\u2019s instinct is often to avoid the pain that can come from retelling or reliving the experience. Avoidance and withdrawal are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But when victims pulled away from investigations soon after they reported being assaulted, when the trauma was fresh, some police officers were quick to label them uncooperative and close their cases. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to sniff out the liar,\u201d said Justin Boardman, a former Utah police detective who teaches cops how to understand trauma. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t give us this training that says \u2014 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s pulling away because she\u2019s traumatized, or she can\u2019t tell me this detail because she legit can\u2019t remember\u2019 \u2014 we think she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s hiding something.\u201d Experts who reviewed cases said detectives appeared to rush victims into making consequential decisions, effectively ending some cases. They noted that investigators violated longstanding best practices by asking victims if they wanted to prosecute their attackers soon after reporting the assaults to police \u2014 sometimes the same day. That question, they said, can intimidate victims and cause them to withdraw. Resources For help, survivors can call 800-656-4673. More guidance for victims and training for investigators can be found here. Prosecution should be discussed only after a thorough investigation is complete, experts said, when a prosecutor \u2014 not a victim \u2014 has determined that charges can be filed. Some victims who expressed reluctance to proceed with a prosecution were asked to sign forms attesting to that. But victims should not be given waivers declining prosecution, according to guidelines by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as far back as 2005. Only the statute of limitations should constrain a victim\u2019s right to change her or his mind about moving forward with a prosecution, the association says. More recently issued guidelines also stress that an investigator should try to spend time building rapport with a victim. Unless the public is in imminent danger, law enforcement should work at a pace comfortable for the victim. Some case files showed detectives closed cases and called victims uncooperative if they didn\u2019t meet arbitrary deadlines. In North Charleston, South Carolina, a woman reported being raped at knifepoint by a man who had once been a sexual partner. Police noted she\u2019d been arrested for prostitution two years earlier and quizzed her about whether he was a client. She told them no. Though she did not know her assailant\u2019s name, she called police twice after her initial interview with information she thought might help identify him, according to the case file. But when she failed to return a detective\u2019s call in a week\u2019s time, he wrote that she was uncooperative and ended the investigation 17 days after she reported being raped. Her kit \u2014 never tested \u2014 was destroyed less than a year later, even though testing might have identified the man. There was no statute of limitations on the crime, meaning the woman should have had as much time as she needed to help police pursue her assailant. Rape survivors expect the evidence taken from their bodies to be sealed up, given to police and sent to a lab for testing. CNN found hundreds of kits were destroyed without being analyzed. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN North Charleston\u2019s detective bureau commander, Major Scott Perry, declined to specify why the kit was destroyed. \u201cEach case is evaluated on its own facts,\u201d he said, adding that the investigation could be reopened at any time if the victim re-approached police. He conceded, however, that not having the rape kit would make the case \u201cmore difficult to prosecute.\u201d In Springfield, Missouri, police labeled victims uncooperative when they didn\u2019t respond to letters mailed to their homes warning that they had 10 business days to contact a detective or their assaults would not be further investigated. In at least six cases, records show, a detective sent the letter the day the officer was assigned to investigate. The victims had undergone rape exams and given initial accounts to patrol officers, actions that demonstrated a desire for the crimes to be investigated. But when victims didn\u2019t meet that 10-day deadline, Springfield police sometimes sent another letter, telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond led to the closing of their cases. The kits were later destroyed, even though the crimes remained within the statutes of limitations. \u2018Failure\u2019 to cooperate When Springfield victims didn\u2019t meet detectives\u2019 deadlines, police sent another letter telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d led to the closing of their cases. Source: Springfield Police Department Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said the 10-day letter is a tool used in all kinds of cases to spur a victim to work with police. He said investigators should use it only as a last resort \u2014 after a detective has exhausted every other means to reach a victim. He did not explain why some letters were sent immediately after victims reported being raped. The letter is \u201ca way to justify not doing your job,\u201d said Archambault, the retired San Diego sex crimes investigator who reviewed cases. It should never be sent to rape victims, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. This type of response will guarantee that the majority of victims will not participate in the investigation.\u201d Victims sometimes leave their homes because they are afraid an attacker will find them again. It\u2019s \u201cabsurd,\u201d she said, to expect victims to check the mail and respond to a demand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that [victims] are being uncooperative. They\u2019re just dealing with survival. They\u2019re trying to get out of bed, get their clothes on, get to work, get the kids to school,\u201d Archambault said. Police should instead give victims time \u2014 and access to counseling and services that help them feel safe, experts said. After that, they are far more likely to work with law enforcement. Joanne Archambault: The former sex crimes investigator says police label victims uncooperative, but \u201cthey\u2019re just dealing with survival.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A woman in West Valley, Utah, said she told police she was terrified that her rapist would hunt her down again, but she received neither time nor support. According to her case file, the woman told a patrol officer that a man she\u2019d broken up with came to her home and raped her. He ordered her to \u201cshut her mouth,\u201d or he would \u201churt her,\u201d she told the officer. He forced her into his car. She said she eventually managed to jump out and run into a K-Mart, where someone called 911. The woman gave police an initial statement about the assault and underwent a rape exam. Ten days later, on January 27, 2009, Detective Ryan Humphrey noted that she called him. She said she was \u201cscared to pursue charges,\u201d he wrote in the case file. He shut down the investigation. CNN reached the woman, who was upset to learn that her rape kit was destroyed and never tested. She called the failure to analyze it \u201cpathetic.\u201d Police did not offer to take steps to protect her, she said. If they had, she might have gained confidence and worked with police. She said she wishes they\u2019d told her, \u201c\u2018Well, we can still help you through this.\u2019\u201d (She asked that her name be withheld, and CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims.) Humphrey, who no longer works for the department, said that in the 10 days between the woman\u2019s report and her phone call, he did not try to locate and interview the suspect or do any other work on the case. Like investigators at other agencies, Humphrey said resources were tight, and he struggled under the weight of a heavy caseload. He closed the investigation, he said, because he assumed that the district attorney wouldn\u2019t file charges in a case without a victim\u2019s cooperation. As he reflected on the case, he acknowledged he could have given the woman more time by leaving the case open and trying to build trust and rapport with her. He could have done what experts said is protocol: offer her a safety plan to allay her fears, such as patrolling near her home or helping her file a restraining order. He agreed that the woman could have changed her mind and re-engaged when she was ready \u2014 her right in a state that had no statute of limitations to prosecute rape at the time she reported the crime. \u201cObviously, she wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she went to the hospital and had a rape exam done.\u201d A specially trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner may spend three to five hours or more gathering evidence from a victim\u2019s body. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Humphrey said he did not authorize destruction of the woman\u2019s rape kit but understood that once he closed a case, the evidence would be disposed. Her kit should have been preserved, he said. Not keeping the investigation open was \u201ca mistake. I look back at this case and can see that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are many obstacles to a successful rape investigation. A victim is too scared to continue working with police. A suspect claims sex was consensual. Testing a kit doesn\u2019t crack a case. But those circumstances shouldn\u2019t necessarily end an investigation. Officers can press pause and set cases aside, then reopen them if there\u2019s a break \u2014 a victim changes his or her mind, new leads emerge, technology improves and evidence can be retested. Yet CNN identified 17 departments that destroyed a combined 92 kits in sex crimes investigations that police described as open or in other terms that mean the same thing, such as inactive or suspended. In Idaho, Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Chief Lee White acknowledged that his department discarded rape kits in cases marked inactive. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears we were too quick at the trigger to dispose.\u201d In Farmington, New Mexico, police reported destroying kits in at least eight cases labeled inactive. Chief Steve Hebbe reviewed those cases and said the kits should not have been trashed. He then ordered a major change. \u201cWe will not destroy sexual assault kits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy them until after the statute of limitations is out.\u201d The chief also said he made sure his officers received fresh training in sex crimes investigations. Proper training includes an understanding of what DNA testing can do \u2014 even when suspects claim sex was consensual. In several departments, CNN found officers failed to test kits in so-called consent cases because they believed testing would only demonstrate that sex occurred, not whether a crime occurred. That\u2019s short-sighted, experts said. A DNA profile of the suspect in a consent case could match a DNA profile of an unidentified attacker in another rape, connecting those crimes and helping to solve them both. The testing of the backlog in Wayne County, Michigan, has linked kits in \u201cconsent\u201d cases to suspects in other sexual assaults, said prosecutor Worthy. CNN also discovered cases in which police listed \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as a reason to destroy kits that were never analyzed. Testing might have produced evidence, advancing investigations while there was still time to prosecute. Even a tested kit that fails to yield DNA evidence during an initial analysis should be preserved, forensic experts said, because testing technology is constantly improving. DNA that couldn\u2019t be detected just a few years ago can sometimes be recovered today. Nakamura memo Two police departments \u2014 Salt Lake City and West Valley \u2014 continued to destroy rape kits after Salt Lake County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Blake Nakamura said he sent them a 2011 memo ordering that evidence be maintained. Source: Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office Blake Nakamura, the chief deputy prosecutor in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County, said he came to understand the importance of preserving evidence in sex crimes cases years ago. Nakamura has been on both sides in the courtroom. As a private defense attorney, he successfully defended a man accused of sexually abusing a child by blocking the admission of evidence. When he became a prosecutor, he wanted to be able to admit all evidence and knew he had to protect rape kits from destruction. So in 2011, he sent a memo to police departments in his county, notifying them to keep all evidence in sex offense cases. At least two failed to follow his directive: Salt Lake City and West Valley. They provided records to CNN showing they continued to destroy kits for at least a couple more years. They also provided documentation showing why: Prosecutors in Nakamura\u2019s office approved the destruction. When CNN showed those records to Nakamura, he was irate. He later spoke with his staff in colorful language he said he couldn\u2019t share. But the prosecutor feels certain they got his message.\n\nIt is particularly egregious, experts said, to destroy rape kits belonging to children, the most vulnerable victims. Young victims often can\u2019t express what happened to them, so their rape kits can speak for them. The evidence can prove abuse because suspects, unlike in adult cases, can\u2019t argue that sexual contact was consensual. Children who report being sexually assaulted should be interviewed by experts trained in dealing with young victims. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Statutes of limitations for teenagers and children typically do not start until victims reach adulthood. \u201cIt takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, a professor and attorney who analyzed juvenile cases for CNN to determine whether they had been destroyed before the statutes of limitations. \u201cWhat police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\u201d Hamilton and CNN identified 47 children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 rape kits that were destroyed before the statutes of limitations expired or where there was no time limit to prosecute. At least 39 were untested. CNN\u2019s analysis did not include \u201cunfounded\u201d cases, those in which police determined that no crime was attempted or occurred. But Hamilton, whose non-profit CHILD USA advocates for sexual abuse victims, argued that given the complexity of child sex abuse, juvenile reports should rarely be labeled unfounded. In Fallon, Nevada, a detective dismissed a 7-year-old\u2019s case as unfounded, partly because the child looked away from him as he questioned her in 2013. The girl described how a man had assaulted her anally, orally and vaginally the previous night, and then methodically cleansed her body. Even though the child was consistent in describing the incident to others, the detective said her body language \u2014 looking away \u2014 indicated she was being deceptive. The detective suggested to her parents that they get her psychological help. Marci Hamilton: The head of CHILD USA says children rarely report sexual abuse when it happens; when they do, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary. When they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Police destroyed the girl\u2019s untested rape kit seven months after the allegations of abuse were made. Experts said the 7-year-old\u2019s account should have raised a red flag; until children reach puberty and start to have sexual urges, they are generally incapable of imagining rape scenarios. The detective, they added, seemed to judge the child\u2019s body language as he would an adult\u2019s. The police chief in Fallon, Kevin Gehman, said the girl\u2019s account was fully investigated but acknowledged \u201csome weaknesses in the investigative process.\u201d He would not elaborate. CNN\u2019s questions about the case prompted a review of all sexual assault investigations by the police and the city attorney. As a result, the attorney instructed police to stop destroying rape kits. The statutes of limitations on sex crimes against children typically do not begin ticking until they reach legal adulthood. Melissa Golden/REDUX for CNN Hamilton and other experts said it is rare for minors to disclose abuse soon after it occurs. Out of fear or confusion \u2014 or because predators manipulate them \u2014 young victims may delay talking about what happened for years, if not decades. That\u2019s all the more reason to maintain their rape kits.

That revelation ignited national outrage, prompted the passage of laws ordering the testing of rape kits and spurred the Justice Department to award more than $150 million to help analyze the backlog.\n\n\"Destroyed\" exposes a lesser-known and more fundamental problem:\n\nThe rape kits are gone. They can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted.\n\nThis North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed.\n\n1. 'A systemic problem'\n\nA rape kit should be maintained for at least the length of time a crime can be prosecuted, experts told CNN.\n\nYet decisions about whether and when to destroy this evidence, CNN found, were made without considering the statutes of limitations.\n\nSome police departments defended the destruction of kits tied to closed cases that they believed had no chance of moving forward, such as when a prosecutor declined to bring a charge or when a victim who reported being raped stopped engaging with police.\n\nBut experts called that short-sighted.\n\nAnything can develop in a case while the statute of limitations is still running. New evidence can emerge or a victim may decide to work again with police, for example.\n\n\"What CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault, who ran the San Diego Police Department's sex crimes unit for a decade.\n\n\"You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations [expires].\"\n\nArchambault was among the experts CNN asked to review cases that ended in kit destruction.\n\n\"There are mistakes in these cases,\" she said, \"but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\"\n\nRape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice.\n\n2. The destruction of kits is a tragedy as troubling as the backlog\n\nDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy's office has fought to test the backlog of 10,000 unanalyzed kits in Wayne County, Michigan. That effort identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. Testing kits can not only solve crimes, it can prevent future ones by stopping would-be repeat perpetrators before they strike again.\n\nWorthy was stunned to hear that law enforcement agencies have destroyed rape kits -- most of them never analyzed.\n\n\"All the attention toward untested kits isn't enough if we have agencies destroying kits.\"\n\nShe isn't just a prosecutor. She's a survivor. Worthy was raped in law school, she said, and -- like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally -- she chose not to report her attack.\n\nIt's a triumph, she said, when a victim musters the courage to undergo an hours-long, invasive forensic examination with the hope that the DNA recovered will aid police in pursuing their assailant.\n\n\"Each one of these kits represents a victim,\" Worthy said. \"What you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\"\n\nExperts who examined case files for CNN found detectives improperly labeled cases \"unfounded\" \u2014 a term that means no crime occurred or was attempted.\n\n3. Destruction of rape kits followed poorly conducted investigations\n\nSeasoned police trainers, a former prosecutor, a DNA analyst and a trauma expert were among those who reviewed investigative case files in which kits were destroyed. They pointed to numerous flaws: kits were not tested, suspects were not interviewed, witnesses were not pursued. These experts taught CNN reporters, who reviewed more than 1,400 rape investigations, how to discern whether cases were conducted in a thorough and trauma-informed way.\n\nDetectives trained in how trauma affects victims know that withdrawal and avoidance are common symptoms. Best practice is to work at a pace set by the victim, connect the victim to advocacy services and offer, if needed, safety measures to protect a victim after a reported assault. It's critical to build rapport with a victim whose trust has been so severely violated, experts said. And that can only come by giving victims the time they need.\n\nBut that's not what CNN and experts saw in case after case.\n\nDetectives imposed arbitrary deadlines on victims and when they did not meet them, investigators closed cases, labeled victims \"uncooperative\" and relegated rape kits to evidence rooms until the evidence was trashed.\n\nA detective with the Springfield, Missouri, Police Department sent letters to victims, in some cases the day after they reported their assaults, warning that if they did not get in touch within 10 business days, their cases would not be investigated further.\n\n\"Victims have lost control of the most personal decision we make -- who we choose to be intimate with. They want some control back... When we send them a letter saying, 'Yeah, do this or else,'... (it) sounds very demanding, it sounds very much like what they may have experienced with the offender,\" said police trainer Tom Tremblay, a former sex crimes investigator who reviewed case files for CNN.\n\n4. The rape kits of the most vulnerable victims were destroyed\n\nIn the cases reviewed by CNN and Marci Hamilton, a law professor and attorney who is a nationally recognized expert on child sex crimes law, rape kits taken from minors who reported sexual abuse were destroyed by police while the alleged crimes could have still been prosecuted.\n\nTypically, the statute of limitations to prosecute a sex crime involving a victim who is a minor doesn't start ticking until the victim reaches legal adulthood.\n\n\"It takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\" Hamilton said. \"What police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\"\n\nCNN found that the rape kits of children and teenagers were among those discarded while the statutes of limitations were still running.\n\nCNN highlighted several cases that underscore Hamilton's outrage, including that of a 16-year-old who told police in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that her father raped her.\n\nA state crime lab notified the detective that it found the man's sperm in the teen's rape kit . But the investigator did not pursue the man. Instead, the detective wrote that he could not find the teenager, closed the case and then authorized the destruction of the girl's rape kit. Years later, police reopened the case and arrested the father without the evidence they said tied him to the crime. What followed was more anguish for the girl -- now a woman -- and another failure for the department.\n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, police trashed a 4-year-old's rape kit and the shorts she was wearing on the day of her alleged assault -- without ever testing that evidence. The girl's mother said she saw a wet spot on her daughter's shorts, and the child disclosed to a forensic interviewer that she was touched in her genital area by her uncle. Policing and legal experts who read the case file said it was possible the wet spot was bodily fluid left by the alleged abuser.\n\nWithout testing the shorts or rape kit evidence, police took their investigation to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges. The attorney explained her decision in writing: \"Unfortunately, no corroborating evidence.\"\n\nPolice ended the case and, two years later, in 2014, destroyed the girl's rape kit and shorts. Testing both might have provided corroborating evidence, experts said.\n\n5. Why this happened and how to start to fix it\n\nIt comes down to money, training and values. Departments said they didn't have enough of the first two. And experts said the third requires a commitment by agency leaders to examine their department's investigations and ask, \"How can we do better?\"\n\nCNN began reporting this project in 2016 after the police chief in Fayetteville, North Carolina, announced at a news conference that his department had regrettably destroyed 333 rape kits.\n\nThe officer who discovered the destruction, Lieutenant John Somerindyke, said detectives had the authority to approve disposal of rape kits in their cases and did so often after conducting poor investigations.\n\nLieutenant John Somerindyke: The head of the cold case unit in Fayetteville, North Carolina, spent two years reviewing old rape files. Many cases looked as though they could have been solved, but the rape kits were gone.\n\nThe agency failed victims because officers carried caseloads that were too large, he said, and the department lacked adequate resources. And, investigators were not trained to understand how victims behave after trauma.\n\nOther departments that destroyed rape kits echoed those complaints.\n\nOne answer, experts said, is more training at agencies nationwide on trauma and on the importance of testing and preserving rape kits.\n\nThey also said departments should regularly audit sex crimes investigations, and those audits should ideally be done by professionals outside the agency.\n\nFor now, that isn't happening. But there has long been at least one exception: The Philadelphia Police Department. It began annually reviewing its sex crimes investigations with the help of the Women's Law Project in 2000 after the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the police had mishandled rape cases.\n\n\"It's the essence of community policing,\" said attorney Carol Tracy, director of the Philadelphia Women's Law Project.\n\nTracy reviewed rape investigations for CNN and has consulted with departments across the country grappling with their backlog of untested rape kits.\n\n\"Kits being destroyed,\" she said. \"That is something I didn't realize was happening.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "UK faces constitutional crisis over Brexit legal advice, Labour warns", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46419790", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe UK faces a \"constitutional crisis\" if Theresa May does not publish the full legal advice on her Brexit deal on Monday, Labour has warned.\n\nThe PM says the advice is confidential, but some MPs think ministers do not want to admit it says the UK could be indefinitely tied to EU customs rules.\n\nEx-foreign secretary Boris Johnson has joined calls for its publication, which critics say could sink the PM's deal.\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox will make a statement about it on Monday.\n\nHe is set to publish a reduced version of the legal advice - despite calls from MPs from all parties to publish a full version.\n\nHis statement to the House of Commons will be followed by five days of debate on the deal.\n\nMPs say the statement from the attorney general does not respect a binding Commons vote last month, which required the government to lay before Parliament \"any legal advice in full\".\n\nLabour is planning to join forces with other parties, including the DUP, who keep Mrs May in power, to initiate contempt of Parliament proceedings unless the government backs down.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"If they don't produce [the advice] tomorrow (Monday) then we will start contempt proceedings.

science minister Sam Gyimah quit the government on Saturday to join the People's Vote campaign.\n\nA cross-party group of 17 MPs, in a letter published in the Observer, has also called for Parliament to support another referendum at the earliest opportunity.\n\nBut a referendum can only be held if the government legislates for one and a majority of MPs vote for it.\n\nThe People's Vote campaign, which is backed by about 30 Labour MPs, a smaller number of Conservatives, the Lib Dems, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, argue that the public must be given the final say on the terms of Britain's exit, now that they know what the deal is.\n\nFollowing Michael Gove's comments on the Marr show, Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: \"The government has made a Horlicks out of Brexit and now one of its chief architects has admitted that the final say might go back to the people.\"\n\nHe said the Lib Dems and \"many others\" will \"demand a People's Vote with an option to remain in the EU\".\n\nLabour's shadow international development secretary Barry Gardiner told Andrew Marr he thought \"remain and no-deal\" would have to be \"on the table\" in any referendum.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he would be \"worried\" about no-deal being on the ballot paper, as it would be \"catastrophic\" for the country.\n\nMichael Gove claimed the Leave campaign would probably win a fresh referendum by an even larger margin but holding one would \"damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric\" of the country.\n\nMany Leave voters would see it is a \"condescending\" move by the political establishment, who would effectively be saying people were \"too thick to make a decision\" the first time around, he told Andrew Marr.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Asked about the legacy she'd like to leave as PM, Mrs May says there's \"a lot more for me still to do\".\n\nBy Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\n\nSupport for the prime minister's Brexit compromise seems to be shrinking, rather than growing.\n\nIf Theresa May acknowledges it in private, she certainly won't touch that notion in public.\n\nRead more from Laura here\n\nWhat about a no-deal Brexit?\n\nThe government claims the chances of Britain leaving the EU on 29 March without a deal are more likely if MPs reject Mrs May's deal.\n\nMr Gove said there would not be another Commons vote on the deal if MPs voted it down on 11 December - something Mrs May has previously refused to rule out.\n\nThere has been speculation the prime minister could return to Brussels to ask for the deal to be modified to reflect MPs' concerns before putting it to another Commons vote.\n\nThe EU has said the deal it has agreed with Mrs May is their final offer and it will not be renegotiated.\n\nWhy are Brexiteers unhappy with the deal?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dominic Raab claims the Irish backstop would be indefinite\n\nThey argue the UK will be kept tied to the EU with no say in its rules until Brussels decides it can leave, under the terms of the Northern Irish \"backstop\".\n\nMrs May insists the backstop, which is designed to keep the Irish border open until the UK can agree a free trade deal with the EU, would be temporary.\n\nHowever, her former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Sunday Times the backstop would last indefinitely - for as long as it takes to negotiate a new UK-EU relationship - \"unless the EU allows us to exit\".\n\nMichael Gove told Andrew Marr he was also uncomfortable about the \"backstop\" but it would be temporary.\n\nThis was because it would hand the UK economy a \"competitive advantage\" over the remaining 27 EU nations, he argued.\n\nLegal advice row\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for contempt of Parliament proceedings\n\nOpponents of Theresa May's Brexit deal believe the UK's chief law officer, Geoffrey Cox, has advised the government that the Northern Ireland \"backstop\" would continue indefinitely.\n\nThey think this is why the government is refusing to publish Mr Cox's legal advice on the EU withdrawal agreement in full - as it would make it even harder for her to convince MPs to back her deal.\n\nThe government insists such legal advice is always confidential - and that MPs will be able to question Mr Cox about it on Monday, when he makes a statement to the Commons. MPs will start five days of debate on the deal on Tuesday.\n\nBut Labour is spearheading a cross-party effort - including the government's partners the DUP - to force the legal advice to be published, ahead of the debate.\n\nSir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions, said the opposition parties would press for contempt of Parliament proceedings if MPs are not shown the advice.\n\nIf contempt proceedings were requested, it would be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide whether a debate and vote should be held."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "'The NHS turned its back on mum - and it cost us \u00a3250,000'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46378353", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:00:46", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright other Image caption Maureen Byfield's care has cost the family around \u00a3250,000\n\nFifteen years ago Russell Byfield retired.

They had plans to travel, spend time with their family and enjoy their leisure.\n\nBut within a couple of years, all that changed. Maureen was diagnosed with dementia.

Her dementia was progressing and my dad's health was getting worse.\"\n\n'We found a fantastic home'\n\nAt the time Russell and Maureen were living in West Yorkshire, but Sandy and her brother were both living in the south of England.\n\nThe family decided the best solution would be for Russell and Maureen to sell the family home and move nearer to their children.\n\nThat meant finding a nursing home for Maureen and a new property for Russell.\n\nRussell, who is now 85, ended up buying a bungalow very close to his son's home in Wiltshire, while Maureen, now 86, moved into a nursing home run in neighbouring Berkshire.\n\n\"It's a fantastic home. We are very pleased with it. The only problem is that the council would not fund the whole cost,\" says Sandy.\n\nLeeds City Council, classed as the \"home\" local authority because of where Maureen had been living, argued that, because the couple had assets, they needed to contribute.\n\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.

countries,\" said Gebru Jember Endalew, who chairs the group of poorest nations in the negotiations.\n\n\"It also gave some hope by confirming that limiting global warming to 1.5C is still possible. Here in Katowice, we must work constructively together to ensure that goal can become a reality.\"\n\nIn fact, so urgent is the task that some negotiators started their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start.\n\nWhy is Sir David Attenborough attending?\n\nThe celebrated broadcaster and naturalist will be sitting in what's termed the \"people's seat\" at these talks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir David Attenborough: Climate change is \"the biggest threat to this planet in thousands of years\"\n\nThe idea is for the occupant to represent the millions of people around the world who are being affected by climate change.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, politicians will hear Sir David give a speech made up of climate change comments submitted by the public.\n\nWill global leaders be attending?\n\nYes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting.\n\nThe number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment.\n\nBut for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical.

Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action.\n\n\"We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,\" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF.\n\n\"Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast.\"\n\nWhy is the UN process slow-moving?\n\nThere is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians.\n\nImage copyright HANNA FRANZEN Image caption Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24\n\n\"Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues.\n\n\"Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture. We are not doing enough.\"\n\nOthers involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world.\n\n\"You have to recognise that things that negotiators and others have worked so hard to put in place are making a real difference,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme.\n\n\"We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts, it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process.\"\n\nHow much of a role will money play in making progress in Poland?\n\nMany developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement.\n\nSome are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting.\n\n\"A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal), will irretrievably slip away,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\nAre there concerns the meeting is in a country reliant on coal?\n\nYes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many.\n\nPoland is highly dependent on coal, getting close to 80% of its electricity from the fossil fuel - and the widespread use of lower quality coal to heat homes, especially in the colder months, leads to smog and respiratory illnesses.\n\nHowever, the Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia.\n\nThis bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some.\n\n\"We hope that the Polish government will seize this opportunity to embrace and promote a just transition that guarantees that the energy system is transformed while leaving no one behind,\" said S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins.\"\n\nWill President Trump and the US feature at all?\n\nAlthough the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24.\n\nHowever, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.

The global average temperature rise actually needed to be kept below 1.5C, they said.\n\nSo how warm has the world got and what can we do about it?\n\n1. The world has been getting hotter\n\nThe world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nThe global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets.\n\nHow years compare with the 20th Century average 2017 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Months J F M A M J J A S O N D Source: NOAA Replay\n\nThe 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with 2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says.\n\nIf this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100.\n\nOne degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger.\n\n2. The year 2018 set all sorts of records\n\nThis year saw record high temperatures in many places across the world amid an unusually prolonged period of hot weather.\n\nLarge parts of the northern hemisphere saw a succession of heatwaves take hold in Europe, Asia, North America and northern Africa - a result of strong high pressure systems that created a \"heat dome\".\n\nOver the period shown on the map below (May to July 2018), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nThe concern is that such hot and cold weather fronts are being blocked - stuck over regions for long periods - more frequently because of climate change, leading to more extreme weather events.\n\n3. We are not on track to meet climate change targets\n\nIf we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.\n\nOver the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the \"safe\" limit of climate change.\n\nFor decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.\n\nCountries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures \"well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C\".\n\nBut scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C.\n\n4. The biggest emitters are China and the US\n\nThe countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\nThe US's environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda.\n\nAfter taking office, President Donald Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement.\n\nAt the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new \"fair\" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.\n\n5. Urban areas are particularly under threat\n\nAlmost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia, a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found.\n\nAnd it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSome 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face \"extreme\" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change.\n\n6. Arctic sea ice is also in danger\n\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012.\n\nSea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s, according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean may be ice free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said.\n\nThe WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest.\n\n7. We can all do more to help\n\nWhile governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too.\n\nScientists say we all have to make \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\" to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.\n\nThe IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product.\n\nThe single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat - according to recent studies.\n\nScientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts.\n\nA recent study published in the journal Science highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food.\n\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures.\n\nCrucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way.\n\nBut as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices need to change significantly to benefit the environment.\n\nBy Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford and Lucy Rodgers"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Is Chile's plastic bag ban a rubbish idea?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46139180", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Plastic bags get caught in trees and litter the landscape\n\n\"They are just everywhere and they are polluting our oceans, our fields, our cities,\" says Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez of the 3.4 billion disposable plastic bags used in Chile every year.\n\nMr Gonz\u00e1lez heads the recycling department at Chile's environment ministry and is only too aware of the problems caused by the huge amount of plastic bags used by his compatriots.\n\nIt takes up to 400 years for a single plastic bag to degrade and very few get recycled, he says. \"It is a very visible kind of waste and one that people are very concerned about.\"\n\nImage copyright Claudio reyes/AFP Image caption The discarded plastic bags are a problem for wildlife\n\nIn August, Chile became the first country in Latin America to ban stores from handing out free plastic bags to shoppers.

She too thinks that the law fails to offer shoppers incentives to switch to something greener.\n\n\"Will there be fewer plastic bags in the supermarkets? Yes. But will people stop using plastic bags? Of course not, because there is no law guiding you to go in that direction,\" she says.\n\nMore rubbish?\n\nStores charge roughly the equivalent of $1 for each re-usable bag and for Chileans like Sandra Jofre Rojas, a maid from a low-income neighbourhood, that means that, unlike Vanessa Cornejo, she cannot afford to forget her bags when she goes shopping.\n\nImage caption Sandra Jofre Rojas says the ban is hitting poor people\n\n\"Here in Chile you have the rich, the middle class and the poor - what are the poor to do?\" she asks. She says she will now sometimes buy fewer groceries to avoid having to pay for new bags.\n\nBut there is another thing troubling Ms Jofre. Like 94% of Chileans, she used to use the free plastic bags shops handed out to dispose of her rubbish. Now she has to buy rubbish bags.\n\n\"This expense wasn't there before,\" she says. \"Now we have to invest both in re-usable bags and buy rubbish bags - financially, it's not good for me and it's still plastic.\"\n\nGiven these concerns, some are worried that those who cannot afford rubbish bags might end up dumping their rubbish in the streets, leading to more pollution, not less.\n\nLife-changing?\n\nEnvironmental groups in Chile back the new law but stress it can only be a first step.\n\nImage caption Mat\u00edas As\u00fan says plastic in food packaging should also be looked at\n\n\"Plastic is knocking on our doors, it is appearing everywhere,\" says Mat\u00edas As\u00fan, the director of environmental group Greenpeace in Chile.\n\n\"It is important for us to understand that if we want to have a big impact we need to reduce plastics being sold elsewhere like in food packaging, otherwise this ban could be irrelevant.\"\n\nThe government agrees much more needs to be done for Chile to become a greener country, but Mr Gonz\u00e1lez is convinced the move goes in the right direction.\n\n\"You are reminded every time you go to the grocery store that this is not an abstract campaign that lasts for a couple weeks and you never hear about anymore,\" he says.\n\n\"It really touches your life and that is really powerful in terms of changing people's habits, people's attitudes to plastic and the recycling challenge that we have as a country.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nation's botanical treasure troves 'under huge threat'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46374291", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Oxford University Image caption A global heritage: Oxford University's vast collection of dried plants\n\nA million plants from every corner of the globe are tucked away inside the cabinets that line the walls.\n\nIt's a scientific collection that goes back centuries, gathered by the likes of Carl Linnaeus, the \"father of taxonomy\", and Charles Darwin.\n\nThey could have had no inkling that pressed, dried collections of plants would have modern uses in assessing extinction risks.\n\nEstimates suggest one in five of the world's plant species is threatened.\n\nCollections of pressed, dried plants are an important \"living\" resource, say scientists.\n\n\"People think of Herbaria as being dead, old plants and not relevant,\" says Kathy Willis, Professor of Biodiversity at the University of Oxford.\n\n\"It's living in the sense that the information it has is as relevant, if not more relevant, to society presently than it was in the past.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The rare giant flower, Rafflesia arnoldii, is nearing extinction\n\nA wealth of botanical treasures can be found at the Oxford University Herbaria, from the bark and seeds of rare African trees to plants collected at the height of the Irish potato famine.\n\nSome are mounted on medieval wallpaper; others bear the signature of famous plant collectors and scientists.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit.

He threatened to tear it up and withdraw the United States completely at times during the negotiation, which would have left trade between the three neighbors in disarray.\n\nThe three were still bickering over the finer points of the deal just hours before officials were to sit down and sign it.\n\nLegislators in Canada and Mexico must still approve the pact.\n\nTrump had forced Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the 24-year-old agreement because he said it encouraged U.S. companies to move jobs to low-wage Mexico.\n\nU.S. objections to Canada\u2019s protected internal market for dairy products was a major challenge facing negotiators during the talks, and Trump repeatedly demanded concessions and accused Canada of hurting U.S. farmers."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Next Trump-Kim Meeting Likely Early Next Year", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/next-trump-kim-meeting-likely-early-next-year/4683227.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he is likely to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in January or February and that three sites for their second meeting are under consideration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting along very well.

Microsoft hadn't been at the top since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.\n\nApple's plunge\n\n\n\nMicrosoft became a contender again in large part because Apple's stock fell nearly 20 percent in November, while Microsoft hasn't done any worse than the rest of the stock market. But the fact that it hasn't done poorly reflects its steady focus on business customers in recent years.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft lost its luster as people were shunning PCs in favor of smartphones. In 2013, PC sales plunged 10 percent to about 315 million, the worst year-to-year drop ever, according to research firms Gartner and IDC. It didn't help that Microsoft's effort to make PCs more like phones, Windows 8, was widely panned.\n\n\n\nBut a turnaround began when the Redmond, Wash., company promoted Nadella as CEO in 2014. He succeeded Microsoft's longtime CEO, Steve Ballmer, who initially scoffed at the notion that people would be willing to pay $500 or more for Apple's iPhones.\n\nThat bet paid off. Windows is now a dwindling fraction of Microsoft's business. While the company still runs consumer-focused businesses such as Bing search and Xbox gaming, it has prioritized business-oriented services such as its Office line of email and other workplace software, as well as newer additions such as LinkedIn and Skype. But its biggest growth has happened in the cloud, particularly the cloud platform it calls Azure. Cloud computing now accounts for more than a quarter of Microsoft's revenue, and Microsoft rivals Amazon as a leading provider of such services.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said Azure is still in its early days, meaning there's plenty of room for growth, especially considering the company's large customer base for Office and other products.\n\n\n\n\"While the tech carnage seen over the last month has been brutal, shares of [Microsoft] continue to hold up like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' he said.\n\n\n\nBeing less reliant on consumer demand helped shield Microsoft from holiday season turbulence and U.S.-China trade war jitters affecting Apple and other tech companies.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump amplified those tariff concerns when he told The Wall Street Journal in a story published late Monday that new tariffs could affect iPhones and laptops imported from China.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone maker had already seen its stock fall after reporting a mixed bag of quarterly results in early November amid fears about how the technology industry will fare in the face of such threats as rising interest rates, increased government regulation and Trump's escalating trade war with China.\n\nReporting change\n\n\n\nApple also spooked investors with an unexpected decision to stop disclosing how many iPhones it sells each quarter. That move has been widely interpreted as a sign that Apple foresees further declines in iPhone sales and is trying to mask that.\n\n\n\nWhile smartphones caused the downturn in personal computers years ago, sales of smartphones themselves have now stalled. That's partly because with fewer innovations from previous models, more people choose to hold on to the devices for longer periods before upgrading.\n\n\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust, said Microsoft is outperforming its tech rivals in part because of what it's not. It doesn't face as much regulatory scrutiny as advertising-hungry Google and Facebook, which have attracted controversy over their data-harvesting practices. Unlike Netflix, it's not on a hunt for a diminishing number of international subscribers. And while Amazon also has a strong cloud business, it's still more dependent on online retail."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Rosenstein Calls for Tech Firms to Work With Law Enforcement", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/rosenstein-calls-for-tech-firms-to-work-with-law-enforcement-/4680801.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:42", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called on social media companies and technology firms Thursday to work with law enforcement to protect the public from cybercriminals.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a symposium on online crime, Rosenstein said that \"social media platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for the free exchange of ideas. But many users do not understand that the platforms allow malicious actors, including foreign government agents, to deceive them by launching vast influence operations.\"\n\n\n\nHe said it was up to the companies to \"place security on the same footing as novelty and convenience, and design technology accordingly.\"\n\n\n\nHe warned that if the technology sector failed to do so, government would have to step in.\n\n\n\n\"I think the companies now do understand if they do not take it upon themselves to self-regulate \u2014 which is essentially the theme of my talk today \u2014 they will face the potential of government regulation,\" he said.\n\nExtortion scheme\n\n\n\nRosenstein's remarks came a day after the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers in connection with a multimillion-dollar cybercrime and extortion scheme that targeted government agencies, cities and businesses.\n\n\n\nRosenstein said many tech companies are willing to work with law enforcement and to prevent the use of their platforms to spread disinformation.\n\n\n\nBut he said that \"some technology experts castigate colleagues who engage with law enforcement to address encryption and similar challenges. Just because people are quick to criticize you does not mean that you are doing the wrong thing.\"\n\n\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials have long been pushing tech companies to make it easier for them to access information on private devices such as cellphones and social media accounts.

Facebook launched the service in January with six cities and expanded that to 25, then more. On Wednesday, \u201cToday In\u201d is expanding to 400 cities in the U.S. \u2014 and a few others in Australia.\n\nThe move comes as Facebook tries to shake off its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and elections-meddling and rather a place for communities and people to come together and stay informed.\n\nHere are some things to know about this effort, and why it matters:\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt's something users have asked for, the company says. Think of it as an evolution of a \u201ctrending\u201d feature the company dropped earlier this year. That feature, which showed news articles that were popular among users, but was rife with such problems as fake news and accusations of bias.\n\nAnthea Watson Strong, product manager for local news and community information, said her team learned from the problems with that feature.\n\n\u201cWe feel deeply the mistakes of our foremothers and forefathers,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time around, Facebook employees went to some of the cities they were launching in and met with users. They tried to predict problems by doing \u201cpre-mortem\u201d assessments, she said. That is, instead of a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d where engineers dissect what went wrong after the fact, they tried to anticipate how people might misuse a feature \u2014 for financial gain, for example.\n\nFacebook isn't saying how long it has been taking this \u201cpre-mortem\u201d approach, though the practice isn't unique to the company. Nonetheless, it's a significant step given that many of Facebook's current problems stem from its failure to foresee how bad actors might co-opt the service.\n\nFacebook also hopes the feature's slow rollout will prevent problems.\n\nHow it works\n\nTo find out if \u201cToday In\u201d is available in your city or town, tap the \u201cmenu\u201d icon with the three horizontal lines. Then scroll down until you see it. If you want, you can choose to see the local updates directly in your news feed.\n\nFor now, the company is offering this only in small and mid-sized cities such as Conroe, Texas, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Large cities such as New York or Los Angeles have added challenges, such as an abundance of news and information, and may need to be broken up into smaller neighborhoods.\n\nThe posts in \u201cToday In\u201d are curated by artificial intelligence; there is no human involvement. The service aggregates posts from the Facebook pages for news organizations, government agencies and community groups like dog shelters. For this reason, a kid couldn't declare a snow day, because \u201cToday In\u201d relies on the school's official page. Discussion posts from local Facebook groups may also be included.\n\nFor now, the information is tailored only by geography, but this might change. A person with no kids, for example, might not want to see updates from schools.\n\nSafeguards?\n\n\n\nFacebook uses software filters to weed out objectionable content, just as it does on people's regular news feed. But the filters are turned up for \u201cToday In.\u201d If a good friend posts something a bit objectionable, you are still likely to see it because Facebook takes your friendship into account. But \u201cToday In\u201d posts aren't coming from your friends, so Facebook is more likely to keep it out.\n\n"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Nigeria\u2019s President Denies Dying And Being Replaced By Lookalike", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nigerias-buhari-denies-dying-and-being-replaced-by-lookalike_us_5c048701e4b0a173c0244298", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria\u2019s President Buhari on Sunday denied claims that he had died and been replaced by a Sudanese impostor, breaking his silence on a rumor that has circulated on social media for months.\n\nBuhari, who is running for re-election in February, spent five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed illness.

His tour of France\u2019s beloved monument came just hours after he flew back from the G-20 summit in Argentina.\n\nMacron paid tribute to the Unknown Soldier from World War I whose tomb is under the monument. He then headed to a nearby avenue where activists wearing yellow jackets had torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores and battled police on Saturday. There he met with firefighters, police officers and restaurant owners.\n\nParis police said Sunday that 133 people had been injured and 412 had been arrested as protesters trashed the streets of the capital during a demonstration Saturday against rising taxes and the high cost of living.\n\nCharred cars, broken windows and downed fences from the riot littered many of the city\u2019s most popular tourist areas on Sunday, including major avenues near the Arc de Triomphe, streets around the famed Champs-Elysees Avenue, and the Tuileries garden. Graffiti was also sprayed on many stores and buildings.\n\nActivists wearing yellow jackets had torched cars, smashed windows, looted stores, threw rocks at police and tagged the Arc de Triomphe with multi-colored graffiti. French police responded with tear gas and water cannon, closing down dozens of streets and Metro stations as they tried to contain the riot.\n\nPolice said 23 police officers were among the injured and 378 of the arrested have been put in police custody.\n\nBy Sunday morning, Paris city employees were cleaning up the graffiti on the Arc de Triomphe. One slogan read: \u201cYellow jackets will triumph\u201d \u2014 a reference to the fluorescent yellow vests that protesters wore to demand relief for France\u2019s beleaguered workers.\n\nGovernment spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said Saturday\u2019s violence was due to extremists who hijacked the protest, people who came \u201cto loot, break and hit police forces.\u201d He was asked why thousands of French police couldn\u2019t prevent the damage, especially to the Arc de Triomphe.\n\n\u201cYesterday we made a choice ... to protect people before material goods,\u201d Griveaux told French broadcaster BFM TV on Sunday.\n\nIt was the third straight weekend of clashes in Paris involving activists dressed in the yellow vests of a new protest movement and France\u2019s worst urban violence since at least 2005. The scene in Paris contrasted sharply with protests elsewhere in France on Saturday that were mostly peaceful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to reach the end of the month. People work and pay a lot of taxes and we are fed up,\u201d said Rabah Mendez, a protester marched peacefully Saturday in Paris.\n\nThe demonstrators say Macron\u2019s government does not care about the problems of ordinary people. The grassroots protests began Nov. 17 with motorists upset over a fuel tax hike but now involve a broad range of demands related to France\u2019s high cost of living.\n\nMacron, speaking in Buenos Aires before he flew home, welcomed the views of the protesters but said there was no place for violence in public discourse."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Israeli Police Recommend Netanyahu Be Charged With Bribery In Telecom Case", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netanyahu-bribery-bezeq_us_5c03d74de4b0606a15b6349f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli police on Sunday recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on bribery charges related to a corruption case involving Israel\u2019s telecom giant, prompting immediate calls for his resignation.\n\nPolice say their investigation has established an evidentiary foundation to charge Netanyahu and his wife Sara with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. The case revolves around suspicions that confidants of Netanyahu promoted regulations worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Bezeq telecom company in exchange for positive coverage of the prime minister on Bezeq\u2019s subsidiary news website, Walla.\n\nPolice have already recommended indicting Netanyahu on corruption charges in two other cases. One involves accepting gifts from billionaire friends, and the second revolves around alleged offers of advantageous legislation for a newspaper in return for positive coverage.\n\nThe prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the accusations as a witch hunt orchestrated by the media.\n\n\u201cThe police recommendations regarding me and my wife don\u2019t surprise anyone,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cThese recommendations were decided upon and leaked even before the investigation began.\u201d\n\nThe Bezeq case, known as Case 4000, is the most serious of all those of which Netanyahu has been accused. Two of his top confidants have turned state witnesses and are believed to have provided police with incriminating evidence. Netanyahu held the government\u2019s communications portfolio until last year and oversaw regulation in the field. Former journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of Netanyahu.\n\nPolice say the investigation, which included the testimony of 60 witnesses, revealed that Netanyahu and Bezeq boss Shaul Elovitch engaged in a \u201cbribe-based relationship.\u201d\n\nFrom 2012 to 2017 the prime minister and his associates \u201cblatantly intervened\u201d on a near-daily basis in the Walla news site, using the connections with Elovitch to influence appointments there and to promote flattering articles and pictures while quelling critical stories of the prime minister and his family, police said.\n\nPolice are also recommending charges be brought against Elovitch and members of his family.\n\n\u201cThe most serious bribery case yet leaves no room for doubt: a prime minister who is accused of the most serious offense for a public servant in the Israeli rule book cannot keep serving one minute longer,\u201d said Tamar Zandberg, head of the dovish opposition Meretz party.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has no moral mandate to keep his seat and must resign today.

The appointment of Alsheikh\u2019s potential successor is being held up after a government-appointed committee rejected his candidacy.\n\nThe other coalition partners have previously deferred bolting, saying they would await a formal decision by Israel\u2019s attorney general to press charges.

Netanyahu\u2019s coalition currently enjoys only the slimmest of parliamentary majorities.\n\nElections are currently scheduled for November 2019.\n\nPolice are also recommending that charges be brought against Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, who has been at the center of much of the corruption allegations surrounding the longtime Israeli leader. Reports have surfaced of Sara Netanyahu relaying requests to Bezeq officials.\n\nShe has already been charged with fraud and breach of trust for allegedly overspending roughly $100,000 on private meals at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, even as there was a full-time chef on staff."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Trump Greets Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, Promptly Walks Off Stage", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-greets-argentinian-president-mauricio-macri-promptly-walks-off-stage_us_5c02f200e4b0606a15b5d9b5", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump continued to represent the U.S. on Saturday when he walked off stage during what was supposed to be a photo opportunity for him and other world leaders at the G20 summit.\n\nIn video captured during this weekend\u2019s summit in Argentina, Trump is seen strolling up to Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, shaking his hand briefly, then wandering away.\n\nMacri can be seen gesturing for Trump to return before an aide chased after the U.S. president to get his attention.

European Union officials said the United States was the main holdout on nearly every issue. Trump has criticized the WTO and taken aggressive trade policies targeting China and the EU.\n\nBut China also pushed back in talks on steel, South Africa objected to language on trade, Australia didn\u2019t want the statement to be too soft on migration and Turkey worried it would push too far on climate change, according to the officials.\n\nA senior White House official said the joint statement meets many U.S. objectives and stressed that it includes language about WTO reform. The official also noted other elements such as language on workforce development and women\u2019s economic development and a commitment by China to doing infrastructure financing on \u201ctransparent terms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official, the language on climate was necessary for Washington to sign on, and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia had appeared sympathetic to the U.S. position but ultimately stayed with the other countries.\n\nWith trade tensions between the U.S and China dominating the summit, the Europeans sought to play mediator. They also scaled back their expectations, cutting out mention of rising protectionism \u2014 mainly aimed at Trump.\n\nThe final language of the statement says, regarding climate, that 19 nations that are signatories to the Paris accord reiterate their commitment to it while the U.S. reiterates its decision to withdraw. It also notes a recent U.N. report that warned damage from global warming will be much worse than previously feared, and expresses support for an upcoming U.N. climate meeting in Poland meant to nail down how countries will meet promises made in the Paris accord.\n\nOn global commerce, the statement says the 20 countries support multilateral trade but acknowledge that the current system doesn\u2019t work and needs fixing, via \u201cthe necessary reform of the WTO to improve its functioning.\u201d\n\nOn migration, European officials said the U.S. negotiator said too much talk about it would have been a \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d for Trump. So they came up with \u201cminimalist\u201d language that acknowledges growing migrant flows and the importance of shared efforts to support refugees and solve the problems that drive them to flee.\n\nThe statement also shows a commitment to a \u201crules-based international order,\u201d despite Trump\u2019s rejection of many of those rules.\n\n\u201cThere were moments when we thought all was lost,\u201d one European official said, \u201cmoments when we spent two hours on one sentence.\u201d\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.\n\nThomas Bernes of the Canada-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, who has held leading roles with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Canadian government, said the G-20 had \u201cveered all over the road\u201d at the summit and failed to truly fix trade. The U.S. was out of step on migration and climate change and blocked meaningful agreement on those issues, he added.\n\n\u201cInstead, leaders buried their differences in obscure language and dropped language to fight protectionism, which had been included in every G-20 communique since the leaders\u2019 first summit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is clearly a retrograde step forced by United States intransigence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is whether we are burying the G-20 in the process,\u201d Bernes added. \u201cCertainly this is a big hit to the credibility of the G-20 to provide resolute leadership in addressing global problems.\u201d\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, one country that was seen as particularly constructive was Russia, the EU officials said.

The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes in Illinois, Missouri and Oklahoma.\n\nAt least three tornadoes were confirmed in northwest and southwest Arkansas, which largely caused property and structural damage. No injuries or fatalities were reported.\n\nPeak months for tornadoes in much of the Midwest are April and June, according to the weather service.

Some homes remained standing but with gaping holes in the roofs or with no roofs at all.\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for around 10 miles (16 kilometers) before it thundered through Taylorville, and the weather service was able to warn residents of its arrival 41 minutes before it actually struck, Chris Miller, a meteorologist at the service\u2019s Lincoln office, said in a phone interview Sunday. That advanced warning gave people critical time to take cover and may have saved lives.\n\nAssistant Fire Chief Andy Goodall, speaking to reporters Saturday night shortly after the storm pounded the city of 11,000, said at least 100 homes had major damage, including his own, Springfield\u2019s State Journal-Register reported.\n\nA Taylorville Memorial Hospital spokesman said 21 people, from age 9 to 97, arrived for treatment Saturday. Most were released within hours. Miller said three people remained hospitalized as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMiller said preliminary estimates are that the Taylorville tornado may have been an EF2, which indicates wind speeds as high as 135 mph. It could take several more days to know for sure.\n\nThe weather service said Sunday that a strong tornado that developed from severe thunderstorms Friday night touched down in Van Buren, Arkansas. It was rated an EF2. About 10 minutes later, a second weaker tornado was confirmed less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away near the town of Rudy, Arkansas.\n\nDamage surveys for the two tornadoes are ongoing but officials said dozens of homes were damaged.\n\nEarly Saturday morning a third tornado with estimated peak winds of 107 mph traveled about 8.5 miles (13.5 kilometers) through Spring Hill in southwest Arkansas.

The reason, it says, is Islam.\n\nInternational outrage over the fate of those detainees \u2015 Muslim citizens of China, the vast majority of them members of an ethnic minority group called the Uighurs \u2015 has reached an unprecedented level this year, with the United Nations confirming the number of detainees in August. Congress wants sanctions, and European officials are urging independent investigations into the facilities.\n\nBut Western countries, the world\u2019s self-styled defenders of liberty, are hamstrung: China is, after all, following their playbook about the risks posed by the 1.6 billion people in the world associated with Islam.\n\nEven as Beijing has felt pressured enough to give up on its old strategy of denying that such camps exist, it still feels confident defending its approach to the Uighurs. \u201cIt\u2019s the necessary way to deal with Islamic or religious extremism,\u201d Li Xiaojun, a Chinese government spokesman, told reporters this year. On Nov. 13, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi doubled down, saying, \u201cThe efforts are completely in line with the direction the international community has taken to combat terrorism, and are an important part of the global fight against terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government claims Uighurs are \u201cinfected\u201d with the wrong kind of thinking, linking the sickness to their Muslim beliefs. Its \u201ccure\u201d is to restrict the length of men\u2019s beards, regulate women\u2019s clothing in public spaces and discourage the use of Muslim names.\n\nThe government\u2019s supporters argue it only makes sense for the rest of the world to support China despite credible accusations of government torture, abductions and tracking of millions of people based on mandatory DNA and voice sample databases simply because of who they are. Countries should \u201cclose ranks,\u201d said Victor Gao, the vice president of the Chinese government-linked think tank the Center for China and Globalization. Popular far-right skeptics of Islam in the West agree.\n\nWhile experts and most international governments see little evidence of serious radicalization or links to international terrorism among the Uighurs, the argument has legs. China\u2019s strategy cleverly exploits assumptions about what\u2019s appropriate in the name of fighting terrorism that the world has been fed for years \u2015 muddying the waters of global opinion, especially among Western political and business leaders whose decisions could really hurt China, and making it easier to continue the biggest human rights violations since Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe U.S., the most powerful critic of China\u2019s Uighur policy, has for years helped lay the groundwork for it to succeed. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Washington officials have focused the resources and influence of the world\u2019s lone superpower on an amorphous mission whose goals remain unclear multiple wars later but whose fixation on a threat lurking within Islam has never been in doubt. Powerful American policymakers\u2019 disputes about their counterterrorism strategy focus on the degree \u2014 from sweeping bans on Muslims to snooping on student groups \u2014 but the overall necessity of it isn\u2019t in question.\n\nAs U.S. government officials have created shadowy standards permitting military strikes even against unknown individuals and as hypersurveillance and indefinite detention by democratic governments have become de rigueur, the rest of the world has cottoned on. If it\u2019s the war on terrorism, it\u2019s all right \u2015 so now everything is the war on terrorism.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad says he had to slaughter thousands of his own people to fight fundamentalists; Denmark\u2019s government justifies separating \u201cghetto children\u201d in Muslim areas from their families for 25 hours a week starting at age 1; American nativists link policies to maintain a white majority in the U.S. to the need to \u201cfigure out what the hell is going on\u201d because \u201cIslam hates us.\u201d\n\nBeijing saw an opportunity early. Millions of Uighurs and other non-Han Chinese groups in its northwestern region of Xinjiang had been asking for greater autonomy for decades, with scores joining violent separatist movements and militias. A small proportion had turned to religiously inspired militancy.\n\nIn the months after Sept. 11, China began presenting nearly all Uighur resistance as connected to Islam and the global networks of groups like al Qaeda, Chien-peng Chung, a professor at Singapore\u2019s Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, noted in an article published in the summer of 2002.\n\n\u201cIn fact, separatist violence in Xinjiang is neither new nor primarily driven by outsiders,\u201d Chung continued. \u201cThe latest wave of Uighur separatism has been inspired not by Osama bin Laden but by the fall of the Soviet Union, as militants seek to emulate the independence gained by some Muslim communities in Central Asia.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 2001, Uighurs who had sought refuge in Afghanistan began escaping to neighboring Pakistan as U.S. troops invaded. Bounty hunters eager for the American payouts for anyone who might be linked to al Qaeda eventually captured at least 22 of them. U.S. forces eventually shipped the group to Guantanamo Bay and accused them of working with al Qaeda and the Taliban as part of a Uighur group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM).\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2002, the U.S. explicitly linked its own war on terrorism to China\u2019s by placing the Uighur group on the Treasury Department\u2019s list of terrorist organizations. In public, President George W. Bush\u2019s aides spoke of spreading freedom and said they told Beijing that it could not use the listing to justify further repression against the broader Uighur community. Privately, U.S. officials invited Chinese officials to Gitmo to interrogate the Uighurs there \u2015 subjecting them to sleep deprivation the night before by waking them up every 15 minutes, according to the Justice Department\u2019s first official acknowledgment of the incident in 2008.\n\nU.S. officials quietly concluded by the end of 2003 that the Uighur detainees were not security risks, and once pro bono lawyers began questioning the detainees\u2019 imprisonment, the U.S. released five to Albania in 2006. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that those left must be let go too because \u201cthe government had not presented sufficient evidence that ETIM was associated with al Qaeda or the Taliban, or had engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.\u201d The Obama administration found new homes for the remaining Uighurs by 2014.\n\nToday the expert consensus remains that Uighur radicalization exists but has a limited impact on China\u2019s security \u2015 much less global stability.\n\nMembers of the community did travel to Syria to join the insurgency against Assad, many under the banner of an organization called the Turkestan Islamic Party, which is generally regarded as an offshoot of the ETIM. There\u2019s a good chance at least a few thousand were involved with groups connected to the local branch of al Qaeda. The United Kingdom added the ETIM to its own terrorist list in 2016, following the lead of the U.S. and the U.N.\n\nAnd Uighurs have committed violent attacks in China in recent years that have claimed hundreds of lives, notably in 2014.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to find clear connections between those incidents and global Islamic terrorism \u2015 and getting intelligence from Chinese authorities to prove their case is difficult for Western governments conscious of Beijing\u2019s desire to rein in any Uighur assertiveness by treating peaceful organizations as threats.\n\n\u201cChina purposely tries to blur the lines between these groups,\u201d Peter Irwin of the World Uyghur Congress, a Europe-based group that is one of the organizations Beijing considers to be a terrorist group, told HuffPost in an email."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Kamala Harris To Decide On 2020 White House Run 'Over The Holiday'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-2020-president_us_5c042a8ce4b0606a15b66958", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Sen.

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee pledged to provide Comey with a full transcript within 24 hours of his testimony, and he will be permitted to \u201cmake any or all of that transcript public,\u201d Comey\u2019s lawyer David Kelley told Reuters in a statement.\n\nIn addition, a representative from the FBI will attend to help advise Comey on what matters related to the bureau he may divulge.\n\nComey and the Republican lawmakers reached the new agreement the day before lawyers were to appear at a court hearing. Earlier on Sunday, committee chairman Bob Goodlatte said he expected Comey to drop the legal challenge.\n\nA judge had been set to issue a ruling on Comey\u2019s request to quash the subpoena and halt congressional proceedings - a request that has never previously been granted by a judge in the United States.\n\nAt the heart of the case is whether the panel should be able to force Comey to testify in secret about the FBI\u2019s investigations into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and whether President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia.\n\nThe Republican-led inquiry has been lambasted by Democrats as a partisan effort to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nMoscow denies meddling and Trump denies campaign collusion, calling the Mueller investigation a political witch hunt.\n\nComey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, is seen as an important witness into whether Trump tried to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nRepublicans have said the FBI is biased against Trump, pointing to Comey\u2019s decision to publicly announce the FBI would not bring charges against Clinton.\n\nThey have also claimed that the FBI made missteps when it applied for a warrant to place former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page under surveillance.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report earlier this year criticized Comey for his handling of the Clinton matter, but said he did not exhibit political bias.\n\nKelley argued in court on Friday that Republicans are violating U.S. House rules by not holding a public hearing where all committee members can ask questions.\n\nKelley accused lawmakers of pushing for a closed hearing so they can selectively leak portions of Comey\u2019s testimony to undermine Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the election.\n\nBut Thomas Hungar, a lawyer for the U.S. House of Representatives, said a 1975 Supreme Court case known as Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen\u2019s Fund made it clear that the Speech or Debate Clause in the U.S. Constitution provides for complete immunity for the issuance of such subpoenas.\n\nThe Republican-led inquiry into the FBI will be shuttered in the coming weeks, as Democrats prepare to take over control of the House of Representatives in January having won the majority in November\u2019s congressional elections.\n\nThe Republicans have little time to wrap up their inquiry and produce a report."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "George H.W.

I was having a tough home life, two projects at work were going wrong, and my confidence in my skills, my abilities and my self-worth entirely were taking a hit.\n\nThoughts I couldn\u2019t control started taking over my concentration. Bad thoughts. Thoughts that my manager was going to be disappointed. Was going to be angry. Would think I was a fuckup. Thoughts that I was a fraud. How had I been doing this job successfully for a year when I was so clearly incapable and an idiot?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a bad day. I was a bad person.\n\nI sat there staring at my computer screen, and from the outside everything looked fine. I read emails, actioned requests, answered questions, but inside I was melting down.\n\nSo I told my manager I was sick, and I went home for the day.\n\nAnd I was sick, but not in the way I told her. I told her I had an upset stomach, that I\u2019d been feeling queasy all day, and I thought a cold was coming on. I went home, removing myself from the situation that was making me spiral with anxiety and giving myself a chance to regroup, to curl up in bed for an afternoon and overcome the panic and negative self-talk.\n\nI wanted to feel better and go back to work the next day fresh and ready to tackle the problems with a clear mind. I wanted to feel well again. In exactly the same way I do when I need to recover from a cold.\n\nI lied to my boss because there is an unjustified stigma around mental illness in the workplace and in general. When someone takes a sick day because of a virus or the common cold, their absence isn\u2019t considered evidence that they can\u2019t handle their work. No, they\u2019re temporarily ill and return to work when they are feeling better \u2015 no better or worse at their job than before.\n\nI wanted to feel well again. In exactly the same way I do when I need to recover from a cold.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: The same should be said for those living with mental illnesses, but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nI don\u2019t want management thinking I\u2019m incapable of doing my job. On the contrary, I\u2019m actually very good at it. But mental illnesses can have invisible symptoms with no outward signs that you\u2019re not coping until, suddenly, you\u2019re really not coping.\n\nManagers can\u2019t see it coming, and hiring or promoting someone they see as having a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d inside them probably seems like a risky move compared to picking someone who doesn\u2019t have a bomb inside them at all \u2015 that they know of, anyway. That mental illness bomb inside me isn\u2019t constantly ticking, though, and when it starts, I can \u2015 and do \u2015 take steps to deactivate it.\n\nBut still, the stigma exists. Those of us with mental illnesses are seen as weak. And why am I so adamant about this that I feel the need to lie to my employer about it?\n\nBecause I\u2019ve experienced the stigma firsthand.\n\nA while back, when working a several-month contract at a previous workplace, all the managers of the different departments spent half a day at a training session on how to support their employees\u2019 mental health. At the time, I was going through a pretty rough, stressful and distracting home situation, so because of the special training my manager had completed, I thought it would be reasonable to inform her of the temporary problems I was having, as I feared it was affecting my concentration and my work.\n\nI received the support I needed: If I needed to take a day off at some point to look after myself, she said, then I should let her know.\n\nAt least she said she would be supportive. But when it came to actually being supportive, she didn\u2019t show up.\n\nThe stressful and distracting home situation came to a head, and I thought I was about to snap. I felt like I might go insane from the stress of it all and my anxiety over the impact it was having on my job. I needed a day to pull myself together, sort some stuff out and regroup. I arranged for a colleague to handle some work that might need doing, and she was understanding, more than happy to help keep my project on track.\n\nMy manager, however, was not so understanding. After her earlier offer, when it actually came to taking taking a sick day, she said she found it inappropriate and unacceptable. And so into work I went \u2015 feeling fragile, feeling a little bit less than capable, and feeling ashamed and anxious for having requested the time off that I thought would have been accepted in the first place.\n\nOf four contract employees, I was the only one who had admitted to some personal struggles (though I was not the only one struggling) and was the only one of us whose contract was not renewed. It\u2019s a very real outcome of admitting to poor mental health.\n\nMy mental illness is a strength. These parts of me actually make me good at my work.\n\nSo I\u2019ve learned to lie. The lying increases anxiety in the short term, but is sadly absolutely worth it for the stability and continuation of my career. A person with chronic pain has a chronic illness, just the same as I do with chronic depression. But chronic pain isn\u2019t viewed as a weakness of character like mental illness is. I honestly don\u2019t get it.\n\nTo me, my mental illness is a strength. Living with depression clouding my every thought, blanketing emotions so I don\u2019t get to feel anything all, it takes a lot of strength to carry on with that burden. It takes a toll on me, but when I\u2019m able to take care of myself and my mental health, my depression makes me stronger.\n\nMy depression makes me more empathetic and compassionate to others because I know the heartache and emptiness and don\u2019t want others to go through it as well. My anxiety makes me prepared; I often think of the worst-case scenario, so if that worst case arises, I know how I\u2019m going to deal with it.\n\nThese parts of me actually make me good at my work. Not bad. But these strengths still aren\u2019t often recognized.\n\nAn inability to do your job because you have a cough and a sore throat are viewed as an inability to work effectively in the short term. No one will even remember in a month. But excusing yourself from work for a day because you\u2019re spiraling with anxiety and need to step back and get on top of it can affect an employer\u2019s more long-term view of your abilities, even if taking that day means that you can get healthy again and be better than before.\n\nThe stigma is real and undeserved. Mental illness doesn\u2019t define me, and I\u2019m stronger than people give me credit for. But until managers and employers start to treat mental illness as just as manageable in their employees as physiological illness, and not a weakness, I\u2019ll lie, and so will so many others."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Khloe Kardashian And Cardi B Aren't Selling Tea, They're Selling Body Dysmorphia In A Bag.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-jameela-jamil-celebrity-teas_us_5c0150f4e4b0d04f48b394e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Actress Jameela Jamil has had it with celebrities who hawk diet products on social media. For months, she\u2019s been calling them out. In May, she said Kim Kardashian West is a \u201cterrible and toxic influence on young girls\u201d for promoting appetite suppressant lollipops. This week, she scolded Cardi B for crediting a laxative tea for her post-baby snapback.\n\nThey got Cardi B on the laxative nonsense \u201cdetox\u201d tea. GOD I hope all these celebrities all shit their pants in public, the way the poor women who buy this nonsense upon their recommendation do. Not that they actually take this shit. They just flog it because they need MORE MONEY pic.twitter.com/OhmTjjWVOp \u2014 Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamil) November 24, 2018\n\n\u201cGOD I hope all these celebrities all shit their pants in public, the way the poor women who buy this nonsense upon their recommendation do,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cNot that they actually take this shit. They just flog it because they need MORE MONEY.\u201d\n\nShe followed up her criticism of Cardi with a collage of famous \u201cdetox\u201d tea peddlers with huge followings, including Kim and Cardi as well as Khloe Kardashian and Amber Rose. These women pose with laxative teas marketed as weight loss products while showing off their perfectly flat stomachs for viewers.\n\nThe problem Jamil is attacking doesn\u2019t begin with the women or these ads. It arises from a sexist culture that tells women our bodies aren\u2019t good enough and our worth lies in our beauty. Most of us can sympathize with the pressures famous women face to maintain a perfect image.\n\nBut Jamil is right to be upset with anyone who uses her huge following to sell unrealistic beauty standards and ineffective weight loss aids. And we should all be outraged.\n\nMost of these stars have access to personal trainers, nutritionists, cooks and plastic surgeons who make their perfect bodies possible. The vast majority of women seeing these ads will never be able to achieve the same results \u2015 even if they are drinking the teas and eating the lollipops \u2015 because they don\u2019t have the same resources as their favorite celebrity.\n\nIf there\u2019s not an ongoing conversation about this reality, the women are selling false dreams, and those dreams have real-life consequences.\n\nPromoting these weight loss products promotes a culture where disordered eating and body dysmorphia are the norm. It\u2019s all in the names. Flat Tummy Tea and Skinny Tea are everywhere. Their names tell customers that this is the path to getting the body they desire. In reality, these products temporarily get rid of water weight, not fat, and they create bad habits.\n\nThese women are selling false dreams and those dreams have real-life consequences.\n\nLaxatives have long been popular among people who suffer from bulimia and anorexia. Encouraging users to manage their weight with what is essentially a laxative is the type of thing you\u2019d see in pro-anorexia communities online.\n\nMany of these products do more harm than good. They can do enormous damage to someone\u2019s mental and physical health. Tea peddlers endorse products without any mention of their dangers.\n\nThese teas usually contain senna, an herb with a laxative effect. Long-term consumption of stimulants like senna can create dependence. Dependent consumers have to continue using it or increasing their dosage to have regular bowel movements. What\u2019s worse is the National Eating Disorders Association warns that laxative abuse can lead to dehydration as well as electrolyte and mineral imbalances that cause kidney and heart failure.\n\nAt first glance, Jamil seems like the wrong vehicle for this message. She\u2019s tall, thin and beautiful. Perhaps, she should leave the beauty standard critiques for those of us who suffer the most. But when Jamil chastises celebrities for the impact they\u2019re having on teens, she\u2019s speaking from her own experience.\n\nShe\u2019s been open about her teenage battle with anorexia. On the collage Instagram post, she wrote. \u201cI listened to irresponsible celebrities and bought all these bad products and followed their TERRIBLE and toxic diet tips for how they maintained the tiny weight they were... and I fucked up my metabolism and digestive system for life.\u201d\n\nHer emphasis on the influence these women might have on young girls is justified. When the UK\u2019s Royal Society of Public Health surveyed 1,500 teens, the respondents named Instagram as the most harmful social media app. They said it made them feel worse about their body image and contributed to anxiety and depression.\n\nWhen Jameela Jamil chastises celebrities for the impact they\u2019re having on teens, she\u2019s speaking from her own experience.\n\nAnd kids aren\u2019t the only ones affected. Another study from the University of South Wales found that using social media for more than an hour a day is linked to decreased body image in adult women.\n\nIn the age of social media, women are altering their bodies more than ever before. Plastic surgery has increased in the United States by almost 200 percent since 2000. The normalization of these procedures is even more reason to be careful about the messages we send. When women are dying from botched surgeries to achieve the perfect figure, being conscientious of the products you\u2019re selling should be a moral obligation.\n\nIt\u2019s possible these celebrities don\u2019t know about the dangers of the products they\u2019re selling. Hopefully, they\u2019ll take time to learn more and correct their course. In the meantime, the issue must be addressed. While we can\u2019t expect digital celebrities to be perfect role models, when your livelihood depends on a community (comprised of mostly girls and women) trusting your influence, exploiting that relationship by profiting from their insecurities is unethical.\n\nEvery woman is a victim of our sexist culture, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a responsibility to act decently. Kim Kardashian West, Cardi B and Khloe Kardashian aren\u2019t hurting for money or ways to make it. Their diet product endorsements are brazen cash grabs, and they should be ashamed to sell women out for a quick buck."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "The HIV Epidemic Won\u2019t End Until We Address Health Disparities In Communities Of Color", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-hiv-epidemic-wont-end-until-we-address-health-disparities-in-communities-of-color-experts_us_5c0157e3e4b0b69ed37aa683", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Nearly five decades after the first HIV cases were reported in the United States, an epidemic persists. Despite effective antiretroviral medications for both treatment and prevention, new cases continue to mount, with nearly 39,000 new HIV diagnoses in 2017 alone. But experts agree the country has the tools to finally end the epidemic at home by 2025.\n\n\u201cOur national HIV strategy to this point has actually not called for an end to the epidemic,\u201d William McColl, vice president for policy and advocacy for AIDS United, told HuffPost.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what McColl and other public health advocates are doing. AIDS United spearheaded a report, along with more than 250 other organizations, outlining a plan for Congress to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to reduce HIV incidence and mortality. \u201cRight now we have a historic opportunity\u201d to put an end to the epidemic in the U.S., McColl said.\n\nThe roadmap for collective national response to the HIV epidemic, released Friday, on the eve of World AIDS Day, calls on Congress to enact legislation and allocate resources to achieve what the report calls a 95/95/95 framework for HIV care: ensuring that 95 percent of people living with HIV receive a diagnosis, 95 percent of people diagnosed with HIV receive treatment, and 95 percent of those in treatment become undetectable, or unable to pass on the virus, through antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to implement this 95/95/95 cure framework with 40 percent PrEP coverage, we know that we can reduce the number of new HIV cases during the years 2019 to 2030 by nearly 353,000 people,\u201d McColl said.\n\nPrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a once-daily oral pill that reduces a person\u2019s risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact by more than 90 percent.\n\nWhile experts and advocates are confident it can be done, they agree that one of the biggest challenges for the country will be addressing higher rates of HIV among communities of color, particularly LGBTQ communities of color, which are disproportionately impacted by the virus.\n\n\u201c[If] we don\u2019t address the specific disparities for African American and Latinx populations, in particular, it\u2019s going to be more difficult for us to end the epidemic any time soon. Sable Nelson, a policy analyst for National Minority AIDS Council.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t bridge those gaps and we don\u2019t address the specific disparities for African American and Latinx populations, in particular, it\u2019s going to be more difficult for us to end the epidemic any time soon,\u201d Sable Nelson, a policy analyst for National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC), one of the organizations endorsing the report, told HuffPost.\n\nPutting Marginalized Communities At The Center\n\n\u201cSocial and economic marginalization leaves certain communities to bear the brunt of the U.S. epidemic,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said, adding that poverty, racism, sexism and homophobia also influence the likelihood of HIV exposure. Eliminating health disparities is a crucial part of the report\u2019s six-pillar plan.\n\nIn 2017, black Americans made up 43 percent and Latinxs made up 26 percent of all new HIV diagnoses nationally \u2015 with black queer men being most affected overall. Similarly, cisgender black and Latinx women are at higher risk of contracting HIV compared to their white counterparts.\n\nDespite being at higher risk, black and Latinx are less likely than white Americans to use preventive measures like PrEP. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released in March found that while half of the 1.1. million Americans who could benefit from PrEP were black, only 1 percent of people filling PrEP prescriptions were black Americans.\n\nSocial and economic marginalization leaves certain communities to bear the brunt of the U.S. epidemic. A new report on ending the HIV epidemic\n\n\u201cThe challenge is getting drugs to people who need them \u2015 whether it\u2019s drugs for prevention or treatment \u2015 and [the root of those] challenges range from resource issues to disparity and stigma issues,\u201d McColl said.\n\nTo close these gaps, the report suggests \u2015 among other policies \u2015 expanding Medicaid and other federal health programs to ensure equitable access to effective HIV prevention and treatment.\n\nBut Nelson said it\u2019s not enough to take a top-down approach; she insists the solution to the problem will come with both federal and grassroots efforts working collectively to reach vulnerable communities.\n\n\u2018Meeting People On Their Terms\u2019\n\nDr. Andrew Goodman, associate director of medicine at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, an organization dedicated to serving the LGBTQ community, told HuffPost that the structural racism present in health care represents a major barrier to care for many people of color.\n\n\u201cHistorically we\u2019ve had a health care system that I think as much as it has wanted to help people, has probably traumatized people,\u201d Goodman, an HIV specialist who was not part of the new report, said. And \u201cpart of our challenge is that we are one agency functioning in a health care system and culture that is just structurally racist and biased at its core.\u201d\n\nStigma is also a big obstacle. \u201cI know in spite of all the success that we\u2019ve had with HIV treatment at this point in 2018, a lot of people still carry a lot of stigma and shame around with them around their own status or feel that from their community,\u201d he adds. This keeps people from seeking testing, treatment and prevention options.\n\nBreaking down these barriers, Goodman said, means being mindful about the physical locations of health services and creating outreach programs and interventions that are authentic and affirming.\n\nFor example, Callen-Lorde\u2019s primary location is based in Chelsea, an LGBTQ-friendly Manhattan neighborhood that is overwhelmingly white. But in 2016, the nonprofit opened a location in the South Bronx, and it is planning another in Brooklyn to reach more communities of color.\n\nAnd Goodman said the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has been instrumental in lowering HIV stigma by implementing sex-positive public health campaigns to normalize and raise awareness about PrEP among HIV-negative individuals. Several campaigns, including subway and bus ads, have been designed specifically to reach women of color and Latinxs.\n\nOn Thursday, the department announced that new HIV diagnoses in New York City had reached an all-time low for the second year in a row \u2015 dropping 5.4 percent from 2016 to 2017.\n\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner for disease control, told HuffPost addressing health disparities among communities of color was crucial to achieving decreases in new HIV cases across all races.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to the fact that being sex-positive, being person-focused and really trying to meet people on their terms changes an epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nNelson applauded New York City for their progress, particularly their work in breaking down stigma, but pointed out that many strategies that work for urban cities can\u2019t always be successfully implemented in rural or suburban areas.\n\nNo one should be dying from AIDS anymore. The science and the medicine is at a place where that does not have to happen. Dr. Andrew Goodman, HIV specialist at Callen Lorde\n\n\u201cNew York has incredible resources, they have incredible advocates...[and] it\u2019s difficult to replicate what happens in New York in other states and other regions across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different playing field in rural and southern areas, and you have to adapt your model for where you\u2019re trying to provide those services.\u201d\n\nNelson said stigma is compounded in rural and suburban areas, where people are afraid to be seen going to centers dedicated to HIV treatment. In these cases, National Minority AIDS Council has found that telehealth programs \u2015 through which remote patients can connect with providers via video chat \u2015 have been effective in engaging people in HIV care and retaining those with an HIV diagnosis in treatment.\n\nDaskalakis agrees that the New York City model is not easily translated to those regions, but some lessons can certainly be applied to rural areas. This includes New York City\u2019s move to introduce PrEP in sexual health clinics and combine HIV testing, treatment and prevention efforts \u2015 so that individuals who test positive for HIV will be directed to treatment and those who test negative will be offered a prescription for PrEP.\n\n\u201cWhat we were seeing is that the very people that were accessing our clinics every day were the exact people that folks say are hard to reach,\u201d he said. \u201cSo rather than recreating the wheel and trying to have them come to PrEP, we brought PrEP to them.\u201d\n\nFor Goodman, it\u2019s these interventions that cement his belief that ending the epidemic is not only achievable but well within reach with the appropriate resources and legislative support."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "How States Are Training Professionals To Recognize Suicide Warning Signs", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/recognizing-suicides-warning-signs-could-save-lives_us_5c019cf5e4b09b7019403af4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "The Pew Charitable Trusts Kellie Johnston, 11, lost her father to suicide three years ago. Now, she\u2019s telling her story to thousands of people to raise awareness and understanding of suicide.\n\nPORTLAND \u2014 For Portland resident Stephen Canova, thoughts of suicide came unexpectedly one December night. Then 20, a sophomore in college, unhappy and disconnected from his tightknit home community, he tried to kill himself.\n\n\u201cI had no idea I had it in me,\u201d Canova said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a lot about that night. But I do know this \u2014 when I tried to kill myself, I didn\u2019t want to die. I just wanted the pain to go away. I wanted out.\u201d\n\nNationwide, more than 47,000 Americans died by suicide last year, according to data released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s a nearly 5 percent increase over 2016, when close to 45,000 people died. And it\u2019s a continuation of a nearly 20-year rise in suicide rates that, along with drug overdose deaths, has been a leading factor in an ongoing decline in the average American life expectancy.\n\nThe 10th-leading cause of death among people of all ages, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people 10 to 24, CDC numbers show.\n\nAlthough youths aged 10 to 24 kill themselves at a lower rate than older people, youth suicides are climbing faster than suicides in other age groups. And the CDC says many suicide deaths could be avoided if more people knew how to recognize the signs of an imminent suicide attempt and the best ways to intervene.\n\nIn Canova\u2019s case, 17 years ago, he said he had been separated from his family and community for the first time, and \u201cjust fell through the cracks.\u201d After he attempted to kill himself, his roommate alerted his sister, who drove for an hour and showed up in time to get Canova to an emergency room and save his life.\n\nOnly 1 in 25 suicide attempts results in death. Research shows that most are preceded by warning signs such as extreme agitation or calm, withdrawal, and excessive drinking or drug use. Many people will talk about wanting to end their lives, say goodbye to others and give away belongings.\n\nBut if no one notices these signals or knows what to do about them, the results can be deadly.\n\nThat\u2019s why Oregon and a handful of other states have started initiatives aimed at training medical professionals on suicide prevention so that family doctors, emergency room practitioners and other medical professionals who care for young people can be on the lookout for those at risk of suicide and intervene.\n\nIn addition, states are requiring teachers and other school personnel to learn suicide prevention skills, as well as teach students ways of coping with stress and detecting signs of suicide risk in themselves and others.\n\nMany states also have laws outlining what to do if a suicide is attempted on school grounds, with some states requiring schools to develop a plan for dealing with the aftermath of suicides by students, teachers and other school personnel.\n\nThis year, at least 10 states \u2014 California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Rhode Island, Utah and Washington state \u2014 strengthened existing school-based suicide prevention laws, in most cases providing additional funding for mental health resources.\n\nNext year, Oregon lawmakers are expected to consider a comprehensive new schools-based suicide prevention measure, as well as increased funding for mental health services in schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible momentum in states to legislate on this issue,\u201d said Nicole Gibson, state policy director for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a national suicide advocacy group with chapters in Oregon and other states.\n\n\u201cI think if we can promote suicide prevention in schools,\u201d she said, \u201cit will go a long way to support students who are at risk by making sure they get connected to mental health support and by creating a culture in schools that it\u2019s a sign of strength to seek help.\u201d\n\nFollow-Up Care\n\nCanova, now 36, is helping other youths who survive the crisis of a suicide attempt to make sure they get the treatment they need to avoid trying it again.\n\nAs follow-up services coordinator at Portland-based nonprofit Lines for Life, which works to prevent suicide and substance abuse, Canova says his own near-death experience helps him relate to people recovering from a suicide crisis. He and his team work with a group of local hospitals to ensure that patients who are discharged after a suicide attempt receive the care they need.\n\nCourtesy of Lines for Life Amy Sloan, 17, is a volunteer at Oregon\u2019s YouthLine in Portland. As youth suicide rates rise, schools and communities are offering more suicide prevention services.\n\nSuicide can affect anyone at any time of life, but research shows that people who survive a suicide attempt are at substantially higher risk of completing a subsequent suicide than those who have never tried it.\n\nAnd in the weeks and months following release from a hospital after a suicide attempt or a visit to a doctor seeking help with thoughts of suicide, individuals are at high risk of killing themselves, said Jerry Rosenbaum, psychiatrist-in-chief at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nStarting this month, Oregon will require all hospitals to provide follow-up services and referrals to mental health care for patients who are released after a suicide crisis.\n\nCanova was lucky. When he was released from the hospital back in 2001, his sister and mother took him home and he received intensive therapy for six weeks before returning to college. He said he\u2019s still using the coping skills he learned in those counseling sessions and hasn\u2019t had suicidal thoughts since.\n\n\u201cI say to my friends, \u2018I\u2019m never going to do that again.\u2019 But we all hit incredibly vulnerable moments in our lives when we feel like we\u2019re a burden and our pain is too much,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s to say that won\u2019t happen again to me.\u201d\n\nCoping With Stress\n\nOregon\u2019s suicide rate is higher than the national average, and the numbers are climbing. Last year, the number of suicide deaths in Oregon jumped 7 percent, compared to a 5 percent increase nationally.\n\n\u201cEvery day, two people die by suicide in Oregon, and nobody knows about it,\u201d said Dwight Holton, CEO of Lines for Life. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stress teens feel about their grades and relationships is physiologically the same as the stress we adults feel about our jobs, our mortgages and our marriages, except that teens don\u2019t have the coping skills most of us have developed over the decades,\u201d Holton said.\n\nMost young people know something about suicide, either from news reports of celebrity deaths or through social media and the experiences of friends and family. A recent young adult novel and Netflix series \u2014 \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d \u2014 that features teen suicide has made the topic even more popular on social media and has been criticized for glamorizing suicide.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that any youth today hasn\u2019t heard something about suicide, Holton said. Still, many parents, teachers and other adults are wary of broaching the subject because of a misplaced fear that they might plant the idea of suicide and cause a young person to act on it, he said.\n\nAs a result, most youths have a limited understanding of how to detect warning signs, how to cope with their own suicidal thoughts or how to intervene if a friend or family member is showing signs of suicide risk.\n\nAnd since teens are often reluctant to talk to their parents or teachers about their relationship problems and suicidal thoughts, the result can be deadly.\n\nTo make it easier for teens to talk about suicide, Lines for Life started a youth hotline that recruits high-school volunteers, puts them through more than 50 hours of training, and supervises them as they respond to mostly texts, chats and some phone calls from peers who may be grappling with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nCalled YouthLine, it provides crisis support and mental health referrals and is answered by young volunteers daily from 4 to 10 p.m. Pacific Time at (877) 968-8491, or by texting \u201cteen2teen\u201d to 839863. The service fielded more than 12,000 calls last year.\n\nAmy Sloan, a senior at Woodrow Wilson High School here in Portland, has been responding to calls and messages after school for four hours, four days a week plus six-and-a-half hours once a week for two years now. She said she appreciates knowing how to talk to people about depression and suicide and may decide to study some type of behavioral health in college.\n\n\u201cSome people reach out to us because they\u2019ve been struggling with depression and relapsed. I hate that there\u2019s so much guilt and shame attached to relapse,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI tell them that progress isn\u2019t always linear and they can get better.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that at least half of all people who have thoughts of suicide, whether they act on them or not, get better and stop thinking about ending their lives within one to three years, according to Harvard University research scientist Matthew Nock.\n\nLoss Survivors\n\nWith the prevalence of suicide increasing, the number of children and young people affected by the loss of a parent, friend or other family member is also growing. As many as 32 people are affected by every suicide, according to the CDC. At 47,000 suicides in 2017, that\u2019s more than 1.5 million people.\n\nPublic health officials are working to support this vulnerable population by making counseling more available in schools and the community.\n\nKellie Johnston was 8 years old when her father died by suicide three years ago. Her parents were divorced at the time and her father was living nearby. After her mother and older brother found out what happened, she said they told her he died because \u201chis brain was sick.\u201d\n\nLater, Kellie, who spoke with Stateline alongside her mother, recalled, \u201cThey told me it was depression. And they told me depression was when someone was really, really sad. It confused me because I knew that you couldn\u2019t die because you\u2019re sad.\u201d\n\nKellie and the rest of her family went to therapy right after her father died, and at 11, Kellie is still seeing her therapist once a week. She lives with her mother and brother, and her grandparents live nearby, just over the Columbia River from Portland in Vancouver, Washington.\n\nShe says she figured out what happened to her father by looking up the word \u201csuicide\u201d in the dictionary. \u201cI had heard the word before and one day after school, I found it in the dictionary,\u201d she said. \u201cThe definition had related words. It said depression. And I remember thinking that\u2019s what happened to my dad. I was more relieved than sad.\n\n\u201cI understand why my mom didn\u2019t want to tell me what happened to my dad. I was too young,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes sense.\u201d\n\nBut the year after her father died, Kellie decided she wanted to help other kids who may have lost a loved one to suicide and those who may be depressed and thinking about suicide themselves.\n\nWith the help of her counselor, she put together a brief presentation and asked her middle-school principal if she could tell her story to the school. The principal declined her request, but the Oregon chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention invited her to speak at a major rally in Portland in 2017.\n\nThis year she presented to an even bigger crowd of more than 2,000 demonstrators in Salem, speaking on the importance of talking about suicide. And she\u2019s spoken twice to social work students at Lewis & Clark College in Portland.\n\nNow that Kellie knows more about suicide, she said, the signs were all there with her dad. \u201cHe changed. He didn\u2019t want to take care of himself. He had a more mellow voice and he was calmer than usual in his last month.\u201d\n\nIn her speeches, Kellie said, \u201cthe most important thing I tell people, especially people who struggle with depression and may feel they\u2019ll be judged if they ask for help, is that \u2018it\u2019s OK to ask for help.\u2019\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Elon Musk Ducks Out Of One Los Angeles Tunnel But Pursues Another", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-los-angeles-tunnel_us_5bffb16ae4b0850623199de0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-03 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.
