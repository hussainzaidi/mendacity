They reveal that a Russian national who claimed connections to the Russian government spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn addition, the documents also detail how Manafort was directly in touch with a senior Trump administration earlier this year as well as his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national who Mueller's team says has ties to Russian intelligence services, though the details of those interactions are redacted.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed Cohen\n\nFor the first time, federal prosecutors say that Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations connected to the payments, Cohen stated in court that he had been directed by Trump.\n\nBut the sentencing memo from the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which was filed separately from Mueller's team, was the first time the government has stated Trump's role in the payments. Trump has denied the affairs, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to the payments.\n\n\"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\" prosecutors wrote in a reference to Trump.\n\nLying liars\n\nMueller's team documents a number of lies told by Cohen and Manafort -- and has the proof to back it up.\n\nManafort's legal team has disputed that he lied to the special counsel since entering into a cooperation agreement -- which would violate that agreement -- but Mueller has texts. The court filing cites a text exchange in which Manafort authorized an associate to speak to a Trump administration official on his behalf.\n\nIn all, Mueller accuses Manafort of lying on five separate matters.\n\nCohen's lies, some of which he admitted to in a guilty plea last week, included lying to the special counsel investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project after offering to cooperate. Mueller's team says he eventually took responsibility for his lies, later explaining he was trying not to contradict his congressional testimony.\n\nThere are now three officials in Trump's orbit accused of lying to the special counsel: Manafort, Cohen and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates who pleaded guilty to lying during one of his early meetings with Mueller's team.\n\nTrump Tower Moscow is relevant to meddling\n\nMueller's memo lays out how the Trump Tower Moscow project is relevant to Russia's election meddling during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe fact that Cohen continued to work on the proposal through June 2016, not ending in January as he falsely testified -- and he discussed it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, the special counsel said.\n\nMueller said that the continued work on Trump Tower Moscow \"occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nThe special counsel memo states that Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThe argument in Cohen's filing underscores that the overlap of business and politics is relevant to the special counsel's inquiry.\n\nFalse public statements also key to investigation\n\nThe special counsel's office made clear that it sees not just lies to investigators but also false public statements as significant in the Cohen sentencing memo.\n\nProsecutors explained that Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project continuing through June 2016 were an effort to alter the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses. By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, the special counsel stressed that Michael Flynn's false statement also impacted what others said publicly.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between [Flynn] and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nInterestingly, Mueller redacts the rest of the paragraph. So if the impact was explained, it is still a secret.\n\nThe emphasis on public statements could offer clues at how prosecutors view the relevance of efforts to misdirect in formulating the first public statement about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting aboard Air Force One the next year.\n\nOne of the questions that Mueller wanted to ask Trump, as seen in the questions that were given to the President's lawyers earlier this year, focused just on that: \"What involvement did you have in the communication strategy, including the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s emails?\"\n\nWhy did Manafort try to hide contacts with administration officials?\n\nOne of the mysteries in the Manafort court filing: Who was he allegedly contacting in the Trump administration during 2018 -- and why?\n\nMueller accuses Manafort of lying about multiple contacts with Trump administration officials, including a senior administration official. Mueller cites a May 2018 text exchange authorizing an associate to contact one official, and a Manafort colleague describing a February 2018 contact with the senior official.\n\nIt's not clear why Manafort was conducting the outreach -- but Mueller's team signals in the filing that it likely has the answer.\n\n\"A review of documents recovered from a search of Manafort's electronic documents demonstrations additional contacts with Administration officials,\" the filing states.\n\nWhy Mueller still thinks Cohen's credible\n\nWhile the special counsel's office does not make a recommendation to give Cohen reduced prison time, Mueller still says that Cohen was a cooperative witness.\n\nAnd Mueller's team makes a reference to Cohen's credibility, which is poised to be a key question if any of the information Cohen provides is used in other cases the special counsel is pursuing -- especially given that Mueller documents how Cohen even lied to the special counsel.\n\nIn the court filing, Mueller's team notes that the information that Cohen provided \"has been credible and consistent with other evidence obtained\" in the special counsel's ongoing investigation, which signals the special counsel investigators independently corroborated what Cohen told them.\n\nMueller outlined four areas where Cohen cooperated, which include his own contacts with \"Russian interests\" during the 2016 campaign, \"useful information\" concerning Russia-related matters, contacts with people connected to the Trump White House and \"the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries.\"\n\nCohen was less useful to Manhattan US Attorney's office, which said that the information Cohen provided to the New York Attorney General's office in their ongoing case against the Trump Foundation \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\n\"After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen's decision to plead guilty -- rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes -- does not make him a hero,\" prosecutors wrote."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Kellyanne Conway's husband trolls Trump's tweet", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Mo5ugTJcUrM/donald-trump-george-conway-tweet-sot-vpx-ebof.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

None of the material in this series may be reproduced without an explicit credit to CNN and the Pulitzer Center.\n\nTokyo (CNN) One of the first concepts Linh Nguyen learned while studying Japanese was \"uchi-soto.\"\n\nIt refers to the practice of categorizing people into one of two groups -- insiders or outsiders. Family, friends and close acquaintances are insiders, referred to as \"uchi,\" while \"soto\" is for those relegated to the periphery.\n\nThe second type, which would have no renewal limit, is aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. Both visas require proficiency in Japanese.\n\nThe first, renewable for up to 5 years, would cover semi-qualified, blue-collar workers, and is aimed at plugging gaps in areas such as care-giving and manufacturing.\n\nA proposed amendment to the immigration law, if passed, will create two new visas for foreign workers.\n\nFor this Japan-obsessed student in Vietnam, it felt like a warning: she could be about to enter a deeply closed society that would always consider her an outsider.\n\nUltimately, though, that was not Nguyen's experience. The 25-year-old discovered that Japan was slowly changing.\n\nAs Japan's population gets older and smaller, the government is struggling to balance its own deeply conservative views on immigration with the need for new and younger workers. Public opinion is on the side of change. Despite perceptions of xenophobia, a 2018 Pew survey revealed that 59% of Japanese believed immigrants would actually make the country stronger.\n\nThis week, Japanese lawmakers approved a policy change proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that will create new visa categories to allow an estimated 340,000 foreign workers to take both high-skilled and low-wage jobs in Japan over the next five years.\n\nWhile this represents a major shift in Japan's approach to immigration, many experts argue it doesn't go far enough.\n\nVietnamese student Linh Nyugen came to Japan to pursue higher education.\n\nShrinking nation\n\nJapan is already a \"super-aged\" nation -- meaning that more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017, a record low since official records began in 1899, while an increase in deaths accelerated the population decline.\n\nThe decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of healthcare and pensions.\n\nBut Japan isn't the only country with such a problem.\n\nSingapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries. Germany is a also a \"super-aged\" nation. And by 2030 , the US, UK,Singapore and France are expected to have earned that status. While the EU and US veer towards populism and adopt anti-immigrant stances, in Asia nations are competing for new arrivals, potentially reversing the power balance between immigrants and host countries.\n\nIf Abe is to prevent Japan's population from dipping below 100 million by 2060 , he will need to provide migrants good reasons to choose the country, says Hisakazu Kato, an economics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo.\n\nA 2015 Pew survey exploring how people in Asia-Pacific see each other revealed that a median of 71% of people in the region held a favorable view of Japan, with positive views exceeding negative sentiment by more than five-to-one.\n\nNguyen points to Japan's solid environmental practices and strong safety record as appealing factors.\n\nBut the country's historic failure to integrate previous waves of foreign workers raises questions as to why migrants would choose to come to Japan.\n\nFaced with labor shortages in the 1990s Japan revised its immigration rules to offer long-term, renewable visas to the descendants of Japanese immigrants who had moved to Latin American after World War II.\n\nBut when the economy slumped in 2008, the government urged those same immigrants to return to Brazil and the other Latin American nations where they had moved from.\n\n\"Japan treats its foreign workers like Kleenex,\" says Jeff Kingston, a Japanese studies professor at Temple University. \"They have a use-it, toss-it mentality.\"\n\nOther options nearby\n\nSingapore has a very different track record. Since independence in 1965, the small South-east Asian city state has built a diverse society by taking in large numbers of immigrants from neighboring Asian countries.\n\nToday, foreigners make up more than one-third of Singapore's labor force , though conditions are challenging for low-skilled laborers and numerous abuses exist.\n\nOn its website , the Singapore government states that non-resident foreigners do jobs Singaporeans don't want, and do not compete with locals for high-paying professional or managerial jobs. \"They are here to help build our homes, keep our roads clean, and make our lives just a little more comfortable,\" the website says.\n\nThe new visa will allow blue collar workers to stay in Japan for up to five years.\n\nExperts argue that Japan lags behind other industrialized countries in extolling the benefits of immigration to its domestic population. \"The government needs to sell how these people contribute to pensions and economic growth,\" Kingston says.\n\nAs immigration policy has failed to keep up with demand, temporary fixes have plugged the gap. Foreigners on student visas, for example, can work up to 28 hours per week -- but Japan has been accused of using students to fill labor shortages.\n\nis one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached Nguyen, who is studying for a masters degree,is one of thousands of young international students and foreign workers trying to make a go of it in Japan. In 2018, the number of foreign residents reached a record high of 2.5 million , although that's still only 2% of Japan's total population.\n\nOn a bustling Tokyo side street is the office of Inbound Japan, a concierge service and cultural interpreter for foreign students struggling to navigate living and working in Japan.\n\nYusuke Furumi at work in the Inbound Japan office with his Vietnamese colleague, Angel Phan.\n\nFive years ago, Inbound Japan started providing foreign students with cheap dorm rooms. Its range of services grew as people wanted help getting phone contracts, setting up bank accounts, going to hospital and finding part-time jobs.\n\nYusuke Furumi, an employee there, hopes Japan can gradually become more open to the idea of working alongside foreigners, and make it easier for them to stay and contribute to the economy and society.\n\nEnter the outback\n\nIn the small town of Muroto, in southeastern Japan, foreigners on the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) have come to the rescue.\n\nOnce a booming fishing port, today Muroto has a graying community. Vacant houses pockmark the area where the town's bars once thrived. Many of the town's public facilities such as hospitals and elementary schools have shut down.\n\nSo when Mie Kinoshita was unable to find a mechanic to work in her car dealership in 2017, she decided to outsource her needs -- and applied to receive technical interns from the Philippines.\n\nJohn Riggs Ancino is shadowing Masahiro Maeda.\n\nThe scheme has faced frequent criticism since its establishment in 1993. In theory, the TITP allows low-skilled workers to come to Japan to learn technical skills they can later take back to their home countries. But opponents of the program allege it has been used as a loophole to plug gaps in the domestic labor market. Trainees, meanwhile, have reported frequent instances of workplace abuse and bullying.\n\nKinoshita was aware of the horror stories. To help create a more welcoming environment, she bought a house for her staff. And while they presently only make minimum wage, which is 762 yen ($6.70) an hour in Muroto, she hopes to increase their wages as their skills grow.\n\nKinoshita's employees John Riggs Ancino and Marvin Curilan, arrived in Muroto from the Philippines two months ago. On arrival in Japan, the pair received several weeks of Japanese language and culture lessons.\n\n\"I'd like to stay here,\" says Riggs Ancino, who worked in a tire repair shop back home. \"It would be great if I could build a family in Japan.\"\n\nTheir Japanese colleagues also appreciate the newcomers.\n\n\"It's still hard for us to understand one another, but I've been working on my English skills,\" says Masahiro Maeda, a mechanic in his late 50s. \"I'd like them to stay.\"\n\nMasoto Yasuda, a mechanic in his late 30s, adds: \"I want to go to the Philippines now. It hadn't really crossed my mind before I met them.\"\n\nBoth local and foreign workers at the car dealership said they hoped the immigrants could stay in Japan.\n\nUnder the current rules, technical trainees can only work in Japan for five years.\n\nAbe's proposals, however, would allow them to apply for an additional five years. But there's a catch. To do so they would have to apply from their home countries, denying them the right to seek permanent residency -- which requires 10 years of continuous living in Japan.\n\nExperts fear terms like this may run through many of Abe's new proposals, helping more blue collars workers come to Japan -- but preventing them from settling long term.\n\nJapan's work culture\n\nWhile Japan might be coming around to the appeal of foreigner workers, not all of the newcomers are keen on Japanese work culture.\n\nSamir Levi came to Japan from Nepal four years ago, after his older brother did a six-week cultural exchange in Tokyo. Levi, 26, worked a part-time job as a dishwasher in a ramen shop and the graveyard shift at a convenience store, before becoming a recruiter for a Japanese language school in the capital.\n\nHe has absorbed the Japanese habits of gently bobbing the head in agreement and executing a well-timed farewell bow. \"I blend in here now,\" he says. \"I've become Japanese in some ways.\"\n\nLevi meets up with friends in Shin-Okubo, an area of Tokyo split along gastronomical lines.\n\nBut the longer Levi lives in Japan, the less he wants to stay. Now a salary man, Levi clocks long hours -- just like locals. Earlier this year, the government limited overtime to 100 hours per month, but Levi yearns for better options.\n\nNow he wants to move to the US or Australia.\n\nNguyen, too, has integrated into Japan and has a mix of local and migrant friends. But she is wary of committing to Japan's long working hours and culture of heavy out-of-office drinking with colleagues, known as \"nomikai.\"\n\nShe would stay in Japan, she says, if she could bring her parents to live with her. Failing that, she might move to Australia or Canada or go back to Vietnam.\n\n\"I haven't lost my fascination with Japan yet,\" Nyugen says. \"But perhaps Japan may need to realize that it needs foreigners as opposed to the other way around.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Eiffel Tower, Louvre to close amid fears of weekend protests", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/RQEgOeEuQPc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) France is bracing for another weekend of protests that could rock Paris and other parts of the country.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government was deploying 89,000 security force members across France -- including 8,000 in the capital -- in case the demonstrations turn violent again.\n\nMany of Paris' famed sites -- including the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Mus\u00e9e Delacroix and the Paris Opera -- will close over the weekend in advance of the protests, organized by the \"gilets jaunes,\" or \"yellow vest\" movement. The name comes from the high-visibility yellow vests that drivers are required to keep in their vehicles for safety reasons.\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner vowed to deploy all the means available to ensure the latest protests are not hijacked by what he called \"a small minority\" who have been \"radicalized and fallen into violence and hate.\"\n\nThe Eiffel Tower will be closed to visitors over the weekend because of expected \"yellow vest\" protests.\n\n\"We have to guarantee the safety of protesters and the right of citizens to move around freely,\" Castaner told a news conference Friday.\n\nStores along the famed Champs-Elys\u00e9es have also been advised to remain shut.

MUST WATCH Moisi: France was supposed to be carrier of hope 10:04\n\nThe demonstrations began as a form of grassroots opposition to rising gas prices and planned increases in taxes on polluting forms of transport, but they have evolved into broader protests against President Emmanuel Macron's government.\n\nMacron appeared to back down Wednesday, announcing that the fuel tax planned for January -- as part of measures to combat climate change -- would not be introduced in 2019. But the movement now appears to be about more than just taxes; it's exposed the growing divide between Paris' metropolitan elite and the country's rural poor.\n\nMaxime Nicolle, a member of the gilets jaunes from rural Brittany, told CNN: \"I'm definitely not backing down now. The moratorium is useless. The people want a referendum, a referendum on Macron, the Senate and the National Assembly.\"\n\nStreet furniture, such as railings around trees, public bicycle stations and benches, will be removed from parts of Paris ahead of the expected protests so they can't be used as weapons, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said.\n\nMunicipal buildings will be closed, and services \"mobilized and determined to ensure everyone's protection,\" she said. In an appeal to protesters, the mayor added, \"Please take care of Paris, because Paris belongs to all the French people.\"\n\nHigh school students demonstrate Friday at the Place de la Republique in Paris over education reforms.\n\nOn Friday, Benoit Potterie, a member of Parliament from Macron's En Marche party, wrote on Twitter that he received a bullet by mail and said that a note accompanying it contained the message, \"Next time, it will be between your eyes.\"\n\nIn response to the threat, the lawmaker tweeted: \"I have always been open to dialogue but these threats are unacceptable. I will not be intimidated and continue my work as a Member of Parliament with the same motivation, the general interest and the same method: exchange and dialogue.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear who sent the bullet.\n\nUnrest spreads to schools\n\nMany of those demonstrating have moved to the suburbs due to rising real estate prices. Suburban protesters, like those from rural areas, argue they're disproportionately affected by the now-shelved gas tax, as they rely on gas and cars much more than city dwellers.\n\nCastener, the interior minister, said he had talked to protesters and had some sympathy with their concerns and economic troubles.\n\nBut, he said, the French government had made appropriate gestures. \"The Prime Minister opened the door, and canceled the environment tax,\" he said.\n\nHigh schoolers set a barricade on fire to block a tramway during a protest Wednesday in Bordeaux.\n\nThe unrest has spread to hundreds of high schools across the country, where students are demonstrating against recent education reforms.\n\nMore than 140 people were arrested Thursday outside a school in the Paris suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie after protesters clashed with police.\n\nEducation Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told radio station France Inter on Friday that he, like many others, had been shocked by images of students in Mantes-la-Jolie being made to kneel with their hands behind their heads by security forces. But he said that elements from outside the schools had used the situation to stir up trouble and attack security forces.\n\nPolice detain students Thursday in Mantes-la-Jolie after clashes with security forces.\n\nCastaner said 12 officers were present to bring the situation under control, which was reflected in the methods they used.\n\nMeanwhile, La Voix du Nord newspaper in northern France reported that a bottle containing acid had been thrown Friday at one of its journalists and a fellow reporter while they were covering a high school protest in the town of Wingles, in the Pas-de-Calais department. The two narrowly managed to avoid being hit, the paper said.\n\nPresidency in crisis\n\nIt's unclear if the gilets jaunes demonstrations will be as violent or as large this weekend. The number of protesters peaked last month at 282,000, according to the Interior Ministry, but has been slowly on the decline, with 136,000 taking part Sunday.\n\nSince the first protests were held in mid-November, 1,648 people have been injured, including 552 police officers, the Interior Ministry said. More than 1,600 people have been taken in for questioning and 1,387 arrested.\n\nMacron will not speak publicly before this weekend's protests, the press office for the presidency said Friday. Macron is resisting pressure from protesters and politicians to speak sooner to calm tensions ahead of time.\n\nDominique Moisi, a foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne and a former Macron campaign adviser, told CNN the French presidency was not only in crisis but that Europe's future also hung in the balance.\n\n\"In a few months from now, there will be European elections, and France was supposed to be the carrier of hope and European progress. What happens if it's no longer? If the President is incapacitated to carry that message?\" Moisi asked.\n\n\"It's about the future of democracy, as well; illiberal democracies are rising all over the world. And if Macron fails, the future of France risks looking like the presidency of Italy today.

And though we don't know exactly what that temperature tipping point is, \"what's clear is that the more we warm, the more ice melts.\"\n\n\"Once the ice sheets reach these tipping points, it's thought that they'll go into a state of irreversible retreat, so they'll be responding to what we do now for centuries and milliennia into the future,\" Trusel said.\n\nDas stressed that although climate science often focuses on the future impacts of warming, the findings show that the climate is already undergoing hugely significant changes.\n\n\"Climate change -- whether it's in Greenland or in your backyard -- is already here and already happening and already impacting people. It's not something that's coming in the future, and this study really drives home that point,\" she said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "American priest arrested in Philippines, accused of sexually abusing boys", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/EeDcsgRc-Qg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An American Catholic priest has been arrested in the Philippines -- and charged in US federal court -- on suspicion of sexually abusing boys in the Southeast Asian country where he's lived for decades, authorities in both nations announced.\n\nThe Rev. Kenneth Bernard Pius Hendricks, 77, originally from Cincinnati, was arrested Wednesday in the Philippine city of Naval after several alleged victims came forward to Philippine and US investigators last month, authorities said.\n\nThough court documents filed in late November cite five accusers, a total of 10 accusers have now come forward in the Philippines, alleging Hendricks sexually abused them when they were boys, US Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Steve Francis said Thursday in Cincinnati.\n\nBecause Hendricks also spends parts of the year in the United States, investigators are asking the public in both countries for information about the priest.\n\n\"It's horrifying ... abusive conduct,\" US attorney Benjamin Glassman said Thursday about the allegations in the Philippines. \"It's grooming children -- young children -- that are interested in being involved in church activities and taking those kids and sexually abusing them.\"\n\n\"He befriended them, he would invite them to his residence\" before engaging in progressively intimate contact, sometimes including oral and anal sex, Glassman said.\n\nUS law criminalizes certain illegal sexual conduct by American citizens abroad. Hendricks is charged in federal court in Cincinnati on a count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places , punishable by fines and/or up to 30 years in prison.\n\nHendricks was being held in a Philippines Bureau of Immigrations holding facility in Manila, the bureau said. His attorney in the Philippines, Mario Ope\u00f1a, told CNN that the priest maintains the allegations are false.\n\n\"As far as Father Hendricks is concerned, the allegations are not true and he will prove his innocence in court,\" Ope\u00f1a said.\n\nHow the investigation started\n\nHendricks has been a priest in Naval, a city of about 50,000 people in central Philippines, the country's Bureau of Immigration said.\n\nHe was ordained as a priest in the Philippines after arriving in the country in the 1960s, said the Rev. Benjamin Pantas, spokesman for the Diocese of Naval.\n\nThe Naval diocese is conducting a parallel, independent investigation, Pantas said.\n\nOf the allegations cited by the five accusers in a probable cause affidavit filed in court, the earliest dates to 2009. The accusers' ages at the start of the alleged abuse range from 7 to the teens, Glassman said.\n\nThe Philippine National Police began investigating around November 6 when two accusers, including a young man, came forward, the affidavit says.\n\nAmong the man's allegations, according to the document:\n\n\u2022 Hendricks began sexually abusing him around 2009 when he was a 12-year-old serving as a sacristan in a church in Naval. Hendricks first kissed him on the lips while the boy was cleaning the church.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would beg him to sleep at the priest's home, and the accuser believed he had no choice. The priest would insist that they bathe together, and the priest would have oral and anal sex with him.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would molest him alone or with several other boys who \"resided with Hendricks during that time.\"\n\n\u2022 Hendricks said they \"would both go to jail\" if the abuse was reported to authorities.\n\n\u2022 The abuse stopped when the accuser was 15, after he contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAnother of the accusers alleged that Hendricks had anal sex at least a dozen times and oral sex more than 30 times, the Cincinnati US attorney's office said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when or how the US Homeland Security Investigations agents got involved. But HSI agents interviewed the adult accuser and four other accusers November 26-28, the affidavit says.\n\n'I ... will have to probably really resign, retire now'\n\nHSI received a recorded conversation, purportedly between Hendricks and the adult accuser in November, in which the two apparently discuss the accuser having talked to police, the affidavit says.\n\nIn the recording, the priest said he's \"waiting for the fallout,\" according to the affidavit.\n\n\"There will be a meeting and then it will be decided, you know, what your parents want to do about anything. Do they want to try ... to press charges ... but that's between them and the bishop,\" Hendricks said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"They will decide, ask you what your decision is, what you're going to do, whether there will be a case or not or whether, you know, a settlement, I don't know. But as far as after that, I don't know what's going to happen. I really will have to probably really resign, retire now,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\nEventually, the affidavit says, the accuser asked whether Hendricks admits to having sex with boys.\n\n\"It's already blottered,\" Hendricks said, apparently referring to the accuser's conversation with police. \"You put it on a blotter. Will I lie? It was a mistake on my part. Should have known better than trying to just have life,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Other children may have been impacted'\n\nGlassman, the US attorney, said Hendricks is not accused of abusing anyone in the United States, but investigators will explore the time he has spent in his native country.\n\nHendricks would spend several months a year in the United States -- likely in the Cincinnati area, after flying from the Philippines into Los Angeles, Glassman said.\n\nThe federal prosecutor said he didn't immediately know exactly where or how Hendricks would spend his time in the United States. But the affidavit says bank records indicate Hendricks has a residence in Cincinnati.\n\n\"We want to find out: Are there any victims in the United States -- in Cincinnati, in Ohio, Los Angeles or wherever?\" Glassman said during a news conference Thursday in Cincinnati. \"(We want to) hold Father Hendricks accountable for any sexual abuse of children here, just as we want to hold him accountable for any sexual abuse that he's committed in the Philippines.\"\n\nFrancis, the HSI agent, said: \"We believe there is a high probability that other children may have been impacted by his alleged actions.\"\n\nAsked whether the Philippines would want to put Hendricks on trial there instead of extraditing him to the United States, Glassman said: \"That is something we are working out with them right now.\"\n\nHendricks was not a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, archdiocese spokesman Mike Schafer said.\n\nThe priest as listed on the archdiocese's website as being a missionary in the Philippines.\n\nBut Schafer, in email to CNN, wrote that Hendricks \"is not 'assigned internationally by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati to mission work.'\"\n\n\"Hendricks is not, nor never has been, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Philippines to serve in a diocese there,\" Schafer wrote.\n\nToni Cashnelli, communications director for the Franciscan Friars, Province of St. John the Baptist in Cincinnati, said Hendricks was a brother with the Franciscan Friars.\n\nHe made temporary vows in 1962, solemn vows in 1965 and in 1986 asked to be released, Cashnelli said.

Brown has said she killed him after she feared he would kill her.\n\nThursday's ruling came in response to a lawsuit in which Brown argues her sentence is unconstitutional, citing a 2012 opinion by the US Supreme Court that said mandatory life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders violate the US Constitution.\n\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court explained in a statement that \"under state law, a life sentence is a determinate sentence of 60 years.

For a month, she tried to get rid of it using a neti pot with tap water instead of using sterile water, as is recommended.\n\nNeti pots are used to pour saline into one nostril and out of the other to irrigate the sinuses, usually to fight allergies or infections.\n\nAccording to the doctors who treated the woman, the non-sterile water that she used it thought to have contained Balamuthia mandrillaris , \ufeffan amoeba that over the course of weeks to months can cause a very rare and almost always fatal infection in the brain.\n\nFascinating, mysterious, and medically amazing case files. This series is the most interesting education into the world of medicine and disease and the human body.\n\nOnce in her body, the amoeba slowly went about its deadly work.\n\nFirst, she developed a raised, red sore on the bridge of her nose. Doctors thought it was a rash and prescribed an antibiotic ointment, but that provided no relief. Over the course of a year, dermatologists hunted for a diagnosis.\n\nThen, the left side of the woman's body started shaking. She'd experienced a seizure that weakened her left arm. A CT scan showed an abnormal lesion in her brain that indicated she might have a tumor, so doctors sent a sample of tissue for testing.\n\nOver the next several days, additional scans revealed that whatever was happening in her brain was getting worse. The mass was growing, and new lesions were starting to show up.\n\nFinally, a neurosurgeon at Swedish Medical Center, where the woman was being treated, opened her skull to examine her brain and found that it was infected with amoebae.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rushed the anti-amoeba drug miltefosine to Seattle to try to save the woman's life, but she fell into a coma and died.\n\nAccording to the CDC, most cases of Balamuthia mandrillaris aren't diagnosed until immediately before death or after death, so doctors don't have a lot of experience treating the amoeba and know little about how a person becomes infected.\n\nThe amoeba was discovered in 1986. Since 1993, the CDC says, there have been at least 70 cases in the United States.\n\nAs in the Seattle woman's case, the infections are \"almost uniformly fatal,\" with a death rate of more than 89%, according to the doctors who treated her and the CDC.\n\nThe amoeba is similar to Naegleria fowleri , which has been the culprit in several high-profile cases.\n\nIn 2011, Louisiana health officials warned residents not to use nonsterilized tap water in neti pots after the deaths of two people who were exposed to Naegleria fowleri while flushing their nasal passages. An official urged users to fill the pots only with distilled, sterile or previously boiled water, and to rinse and dry them after each use.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Improper nasal irrigation has been reported as a method of infection for the comparably insidious amoeba,\" the doctors say in the research paper about the Seattle woman. \"This precedent led us to suspect the same route of entry for the ... amoeba in our case.\"\n\nThe woman's doctors say they weren't able to definitely link the infection to her neti pot, as the water supply to her home was not tested for the amoeba. They hope her case will let other doctors know to consider an amoeba infection if a patient gets a sore or rash on the nose after rinsing their sinuses.\n\nKristen Maki, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Health, said in an email that \"Large municipal water supplies ... have robust source water protection programs\" and treatment programs, and she noted that \"Well protected groundwater supplies are logically expected to be free of any such large amoeba\" such as Balamuthia."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Snow to blanket the South this weekend", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/hk5Enbjqy0A/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\n\nHow far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation.

Texas' governor on Friday raised the state's official readiness level as the stormed pushed in, while his counterpart in North Carolina announced he'll declare a statewide state of emergency.\n\nAs the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nHere is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when:\n\nTexas and Oklahoma\n\nTiming: Friday morning through Saturday evening\n\nPrecipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday.\n\nImpacts: Snow, ice and flooding rain\n\nSnowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. As of Friday evening, Austin had 2.95 inches of rain and an area of east Texas saw 3.4 inches.\n\nNearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots.\n\nOklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches.\n\nArkansas and western Tennessee\n\nTiming: Friday afternoon through Saturday\n\nMost Arkansans didn't get precipitation until later Friday, and winter weather was predicted to begin in the overnight hours and move east Saturday morning toward Tennessee.\n\nImpacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow\n\nThe southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch.\n\nSnow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible.\n\nEastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas\n\nTiming: Saturday morning through Monday morning\n\nPrecipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas.\n\nImpacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix\n\nSignificant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a \"once-in-a-generation event.\" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow.\n\nWhile most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon.\n\nSnow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called \"cold-air damming\" or \"the wedge\" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians.

They reveal that a Russian national who claimed connections to the Russian government spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn addition, the documents also detail how Manafort was directly in touch with a senior Trump administration earlier this year as well as his contact with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national who Mueller's team says has ties to Russian intelligence services, though the details of those interactions are redacted.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nProsecutors say Trump directed Cohen\n\nFor the first time, federal prosecutors say that Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations connected to the payments, Cohen stated in court that he had been directed by Trump.\n\nBut the sentencing memo from the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which was filed separately from Mueller's team, was the first time the government has stated Trump's role in the payments. Trump has denied the affairs, and he has not been accused of any crimes related to the payments.\n\n\"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\" prosecutors wrote in a reference to Trump.\n\nLying liars\n\nMueller's team documents a number of lies told by Cohen and Manafort -- and has the proof to back it up.\n\nManafort's legal team has disputed that he lied to the special counsel since entering into a cooperation agreement -- which would violate that agreement -- but Mueller has texts. The court filing cites a text exchange in which Manafort authorized an associate to speak to a Trump administration official on his behalf.\n\nIn all, Mueller accuses Manafort of lying on five separate matters.\n\nCohen's lies, some of which he admitted to in a guilty plea last week, included lying to the special counsel investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project after offering to cooperate. Mueller's team says he eventually took responsibility for his lies, later explaining he was trying not to contradict his congressional testimony.\n\nThere are now three officials in Trump's orbit accused of lying to the special counsel: Manafort, Cohen and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates who pleaded guilty to lying during one of his early meetings with Mueller's team.\n\nTrump Tower Moscow is relevant to meddling\n\nMueller's memo lays out how the Trump Tower Moscow project is relevant to Russia's election meddling during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe fact that Cohen continued to work on the proposal through June 2016, not ending in January as he falsely testified -- and he discussed it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, the special counsel said.\n\nMueller said that the continued work on Trump Tower Moscow \"occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nThe special counsel memo states that Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThe argument in Cohen's filing underscores that the overlap of business and politics is relevant to the special counsel's inquiry.\n\nFalse public statements also key to investigation\n\nThe special counsel's office made clear that it sees not just lies to investigators but also false public statements as significant in the Cohen sentencing memo.\n\nProsecutors explained that Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project continuing through June 2016 were an effort to alter the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses. By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, the special counsel stressed that Michael Flynn's false statement also impacted what others said publicly.\n\n\"Several senior members of the transition publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between [Flynn] and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nInterestingly, Mueller redacts the rest of the paragraph. So if the impact was explained, it is still a secret.\n\nThe emphasis on public statements could offer clues at how prosecutors view the relevance of efforts to misdirect in formulating the first public statement about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting aboard Air Force One the next year.\n\nOne of the questions that Mueller wanted to ask Trump, as seen in the questions that were given to the President's lawyers earlier this year, focused just on that: \"What involvement did you have in the communication strategy, including the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s emails?\"\n\nWhy did Manafort try to hide contacts with administration officials?\n\nOne of the mysteries in the Manafort court filing: Who was he allegedly contacting in the Trump administration during 2018 -- and why?\n\nMueller accuses Manafort of lying about multiple contacts with Trump administration officials, including a senior administration official. Mueller cites a May 2018 text exchange authorizing an associate to contact one official, and a Manafort colleague describing a February 2018 contact with the senior official.\n\nIt's not clear why Manafort was conducting the outreach -- but Mueller's team signals in the filing that it likely has the answer.\n\n\"A review of documents recovered from a search of Manafort's electronic documents demonstrations additional contacts with Administration officials,\" the filing states.\n\nWhy Mueller still thinks Cohen's credible\n\nWhile the special counsel's office does not make a recommendation to give Cohen reduced prison time, Mueller still says that Cohen was a cooperative witness.\n\nAnd Mueller's team makes a reference to Cohen's credibility, which is poised to be a key question if any of the information Cohen provides is used in other cases the special counsel is pursuing -- especially given that Mueller documents how Cohen even lied to the special counsel.\n\nIn the court filing, Mueller's team notes that the information that Cohen provided \"has been credible and consistent with other evidence obtained\" in the special counsel's ongoing investigation, which signals the special counsel investigators independently corroborated what Cohen told them.\n\nMueller outlined four areas where Cohen cooperated, which include his own contacts with \"Russian interests\" during the 2016 campaign, \"useful information\" concerning Russia-related matters, contacts with people connected to the Trump White House and \"the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries.\"\n\nCohen was less useful to Manhattan US Attorney's office, which said that the information Cohen provided to the New York Attorney General's office in their ongoing case against the Trump Foundation \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\n\"After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the Presidential election, Cohen's decision to plead guilty -- rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes -- does not make him a hero,\" prosecutors wrote."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Prosecutors: Michael Cohen acted at Trump's direction when he broke the law", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/0ui5FEyRWHQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) Federal prosecutors said for the first time Friday that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Donald Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign, as special counsel Robert Mueller outlined a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nThose revelations came in a set of court filings in which federal prosecutors in New York said Cohen should receive a \"substantial\" prison sentence of roughly four years for tax fraud and campaign-finance crimes, and as Mueller's office accused the President's former attorney of lying to them about his contacts with Russia.\n\nMueller's disclosures also exposed deeper entanglements than previously known between Trump, his campaign apparatus and the Russian government, including that a Russian national who claimed to be well-connected in Moscow spoke with Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes after being charged by Manhattan federal prosecutors. Those included tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-presidential candidate. Trump has denied those claims.\n\nOn Friday, prosecutors wrote, \"In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1.\" Individual-1 is the term prosecutors have been using to refer to the President.\n\nThe pair of memos from two sets of prosecutors reflected competing views of Cohen's utility to the federal investigations ahead of his scheduled sentencing on Wednesday.\n\nIn their filing, prosecutors from the Manhattan US attorney's office knocked Cohen's \"rose-colored view of the seriousness of his crimes,\" noting his years-long willingness to break the law. \"He was motivated to do so by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends,\" they wrote in a filing that also sought to puncture Cohen's public pronouncements of assistance in their investigations.\n\nMueller's team acknowledged that Cohen provided \"useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation,\" but also disclosed that he had initially lied to them about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.\n\nContact with Russians\n\nIn addition to the August case, Cohen was subsequently charged last week by the special counsel's office with one count of lying to Congress about the Moscow project. He pleaded guilty, disclosing that talks about the effort in Moscow had extended through June 2016, after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and that both Trump and his family members had been briefed on the discussions. Cohen also acknowledged pursuing plans to send Trump and himself to Russia in service of the project and discussing the proposed development directly with a representative of the Kremlin.\n\nThe special counsel's Friday memo on the matter suggested that Cohen's -- and, by extension, Trump's -- intersection with Russians eager to aid the presidential campaign was more substantial than previously known, with the Russians anxious to put Trump face-to-face with their president.\n\nIn one instance, Cohen spoke in November 2015 to a Russian national who offered \"synergy on a government level\" to the Trump presidential campaign and \"repeatedly proposed\" a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to court papers.\n\nThe interest appears to have been reciprocal. Cohen told the special counsel that he had consulted with Trump about his interest in contacting the Russian government before suggesting in a radio interview in September 2015 that Trump meet with Putin during the Russian President's visit to New York City that fall.\n\nCohen had previously claimed his comments on air were spontaneous, the court papers said, but he admitted to prosecutors that they came about after his discussion with Trump.\n\nThat meeting never happened, nor did the one with the Russian national, although Cohen told the special counsel that was due to the fact that he was working on the Moscow project \"with a different individual who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.\"\n\nMueller's sentencing memo also provided the first explanation of the Trump Tower Moscow project's relevance to Russia's interference during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAccording to the special counsel, Cohen's false statements to investigators about the Trump Tower Moscow project \"obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government.\"\n\nThat Cohen continued to work on the Trump Tower Moscow project -- and discuss it with Trump -- was material to both the ongoing congressional and special counsel investigations, prosecutors said, noting in particular that \"it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\"\n\nA tightening net\n\nThe filings on Cohen, and a submission from Mueller about Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, appear to further tighten the net that Mueller is gathering around the President and his inner circle.\n\nThey come at a time when Trump appears to be increasingly worried and furious about the investigation, following a searing tweet storm aimed at the special counsel on Friday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed the significance of prosecutors' findings, saying late Friday that \"the government's filings in Mr. Cohen's case tell us nothing of value that wasn't already known. Mr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\"\n\nThe memos also appear to take aim at several issues that have and could continue to ensnare others in the President's orbit, including the act of lying not just to federal agents but also to the public and the media. Cohen's effort to lie about the Moscow project, they said, constituted an attempt to alter the course of the investigation.\n\n\"The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses,\" prosecutors wrote. \"By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what occurred in the hopes of limiting the investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election -- an issue of heightened national interest.\"\n\nProsecutors unhappy with Cohen's cooperation\n\nDespite Cohen's disclosures to the special counsel, however, Manhattan federal prosecutors sought repeatedly to emphasize the limited nature of his assistance in other investigations.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors have continued to investigate the Trump Organization based on information in the charges against Cohen, CNN has reported, and Cohen met with prosecutors to discuss \"the participation of others in the campaign finance crimes,\" they said in their filing. But, they noted, he \"declined to meet with the office about other areas of investigative interest.\"\n\nProsecutors also said the information Cohen has provided to the New York State Attorney General's Office, which has a civil lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation, \"warrants little to no consideration as a mitigating factor.\"\n\nAnd while Cohen has met with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, which has also been examining the Trump Organization, CNN has reported, his assistance \"appears to consist solely of providing that entity information that they would otherwise have obtained via subpoena.\"\n\nThe Cohen cases are being considered together for sentencing purposes. In the New York federal prosecutors' case, the sentencing guidelines call for a term of 51 to 63 months in prison, and prosecutors on Friday asked the court to \"impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable guidelines range.\"\n\nUS District Judge William Pauley III can deviate from the guidelines when he determines Cohen's sentence.\n\nCohen's attorneys have asked the court to give him no prison time, but prosecutors on Friday voiced their objection to that proposal, noting that the crimes Cohen committed had far-reaching consequences that extended all the way to the White House.\n\n\"While many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\" they wrote.\n\n\"He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1,\" they said. \"In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump announces John Kelly is leaving", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/ugemmbOjHU4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) White House chief of staff John Kelly will be leaving his position at the end of the year, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Saturday afternoon.\n\nCNN on Friday reported that Kelly was expected to announce his departure in the coming days.\n\n\"John Kelly will be leaving at the end of the year,\" Trump told reporters before departing the White House for the Army-Navy game.\n\nTrump noted Kelly had been with him for almost two years in his roles as chief of staff and secretary of homeland security.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "The Point: Friday was a very, very bad day for Donald Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/jd9mkGEDYgY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) On Friday, President Donald Trump (and the rest of us) got the most fulsome look into the inner workings of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation yet.

Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health.

The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.\n\nThe ministry also reported that more than 41,000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August.

The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants. There is so little out there,\" said Judith Lupo Wold , a professor of nursing at Emory University and director of Emory's Farmworker Family Health program . She said studies like these can help public health leaders make the casefor better living conditions.\n\nThe migrants for whom her program provides medical care are fairly young and healthy, she said, due to the nature of the work they do. \"Otherwise, they wouldn't be here, since they are here to make money for their families back home, and picking vegetables and fruit living as some of the poorest of the poor in this country is incredibly hard work,\" Wold said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWold said she has seen an increase in diabetes among migrants, but that's mostly because they \"can't afford to buy the healthy fruits and vegetables they pick.\"\n\nShe said migrant workers typically are at greater risk for infections due to their poor living conditions. Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

Drivers of climate change, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against climate change, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.\n\nGlobal leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris climate agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that \"we are in deep trouble with climate change.\"\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThe new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on climate change and public health for more than three decades.\n\n\"The most direct link between climate change and ill health is air pollution,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving climate change and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nThose recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote climate goals; engaging the health community in addressing climate change; and systematically tracking progress in health from such climate change mitigation.\n\nThe report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris climate agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.\n\nGeneral climate change-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.\n\nOnly about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of climate change-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral climate funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.\n\n'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'\n\nThe new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of climate change, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and director of the program on climate and health at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication . She was not involved in the report.\n\nJUST WATCHED New climate change report issues stark warning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New climate change report issues stark warning 02:13\n\nIn October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nThen, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change showed how extreme heat from climate change already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide.\n\nAlso last month, the US government's National Climate Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to climate change-related impacts.\n\nThe new WHO report comes with a message that \"addressing climate change is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,\" Sarfaty said. \"The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.\"\n\nAs for the Paris Agreement, \"there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,\" she said.\n\n\"This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits we can gain if we go forward into a future powered by clean energy and highly efficient energy use,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of climate change -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.\n\nThe air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area. For instance, \"after the 2017 Northern California fires were out -- Sonoma and Napa were two of the counties -- survivors who did not have a pre-existing respiratory condition were reporting

led to an \"inaccurate\" story about federal funding of controversial fetal tissue research, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday.\n\nHHS's National Institutes of Health has made no decision on whether to extend a University of California, San Francisco contract for controversial research involving fetal tissue, said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS.\n\nHer statement contradicts Washington Post reporting Tuesday that the \"Trump administration has thrown into doubt a multimillion-dollar research contract\" with UCSF to test new treatments for HIV.\n\nAccording to the Post, an anonymous source said a National Institutes of Health official told a UCSF investigator that the decision to end a seven-year contract before its completion was coming from the \"highest levels.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Washington Post chose to report assertions that are completely false,\" Oakley said.\n\nOakley said that there were \"no traceable records\" proving these claims made by the Post's anonymous source and that \"multiple, on-the-record assurances from senior officials at both the National Institutes of Health and in the Office of the Secretary\" told the Post that the claims were incorrect.\n\nThe Post also reported that a letter from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the contract would continue for 90 days rather than the expected year-long renewal.\n\n\"No contracting official would have had the authority to impart any communication to UCSF that the contract was being cancelled because no decision has been made,\" Oakley said.\n\nRenate Myles, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said on Thursday that \"NIH did, however, send a letter to UCSF to notify them of our intent to ensure continuity of service for 90 days while the audit continues and until a final decision is made on the contract.\"\n\nDoan would not comment, though she said the \"research is conducted in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as ethical standards.\"\n\nOakley emphasized that \"a decision will be made when the contract has been reviewed, pursuant to the ongoing audit/review process\" initiated by the HHS in September\n\nThe battle over human fetal tissue research\n\nTwo months ago, the HHS did terminate a contract: one struck between the Food and Drug Administration (an agency within the HHS) and a biotech company that was slated to provide about $16,000 of human fetal tissue for federal research.\n\nThe FDA explained in a notice posted online that \"fresh human tissues are required\" to create mice with human immune systems, which is necessary when testing drugs \"for safety and efficacy.\"\n\nHowever, a response letter from more than 80 House Republications to the FDA called for the cancellation of this federal contract with Advanced Bioscience Resources Inc.\n\nIn September, the HHS not only terminated the contract, it stated that \"in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved,\" it had \"initiated a comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\" while \"continuing to review whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue in HHS funded research.\"\n\nGenerally, fetal tissue is obtained through elective abortions and is used to develop cells that \"mimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers,\" according to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report\n\nThe National Institutes of Health spends about $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows . Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush attempted a compromise when he introduced a ban on federal funding of research on newly created human embryonic stem cell lines yet allowed for continued funding of research on lines created prior to that date. Bush also publicly called for the use of alternatives . In 2009, President Barack Obama revoked these orders and allowed the National Institutes of Health to issue new criteria for stem cell research.\n\nThe hope for alternatives has been revived by the current administration. In its September statement, HHS concluded that it is continuing to review \"whether adequate alternatives exist to the use of human fetal tissue\" and \"will ensure that efforts to develop such alternatives are funded and accelerated.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Yellow vest protest in Paris sees police detain hundreds", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46492070", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters surged forward before tear gas was fired\n\nPolice in Paris have fired rubber bullets and tear gas on protesters as a fourth weekend of anti-government protests turned violent.\n\nThe clashes came after up to 8,000 demonstrators gathered in the city centre.

But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness \"probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion\".\n\nHe also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nSir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more \"risk averse\" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment. Well, that is not acceptable.\"\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Chang'e-4: China mission launches to far side of Moon", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46471668", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright CNSA Image caption Artwork: The Chang'e-4 rover will explore a huge impact basin on the far side\n\nChina has launched the first mission to land a robotic craft on the far side of the Moon, Chinese media say.\n\nThe Chang'e-4 mission will see a static lander and rover touch down in Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater, located on the side of the Moon which never faces Earth.\n\nThe payload blasted off atop a Long March 3B rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center.\n\nThe mission will pave the way for the country to deliver samples of Moon rock and soil to Earth.\n\nThe landing will not occur until early January, when the probe will descend on thrusters and touch down on the rugged terrain of the lunar far side.\n\nVon K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater is of interest to scientists because it is located within the oldest and largest impact feature on the Moon - the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This was probably formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago.\n\nThe landers will characterise the region's geology and the composition of rock and soil.\n\nBecause of a phenomenon called \"tidal locking\", we see only one \"face\" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.\n\nThough often referred to as the \"dark side\", this face of the Moon is also illuminated by the Sun and has the same phases as the near side; \"dark\" in this context simply means \"unseen\".\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The lunar far side has a thicker crust and is more heavily cratered than the near side\n\nThe far side looks rather different to the more familiar near side. It has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also few of the \"mare\" - dark basaltic \"seas\" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.\n\nThe powerful impact that created the South Pole Aitken Basin may have punched through the crust down to the Moon's mantle layer. Chang'e-4's instruments could examine whether this was the case, shedding light on the early history of our only natural satellite.\n\nSeed experiment\n\nThe mission will also characterise the \"radio environment\" on the far side, a test designed to lay the groundwork for the creation of future radio astronomy telescopes on the far side, which is shielded from the radio noise of Earth.\n\nThe static lander will carry a 3kg (6.6lb) container with potato and arabidopsis plant seeds to perform a biological experiment. The \"lunar mini biosphere\" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.\n\n\"We want to study the respiration of the seeds and the photosynthesis on the Moon,\" Liu Hanlong, chief director of the experiment and vice president of Chongqing University, told the state-run Xinhua news agency earlier this year.\n\nImage copyright CNSA Image caption China's Yutu rover, part of the Chang'e-3 mission, explored the Moon in 2013\n\nXie Gengxin, chief designer of the experiment, told Xinhua: \"We have to keep the temperature in the 'mini biosphere' within a range from 1 degree to 30 degrees, and properly control the humidity and nutrition. We will use a tube to direct the natural light on the surface of Moon into the tin to make the plants grow.\"\n\nBecause the landers on the far side have no line of sight with our planet, they must send data back via a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year.\n\nThe probe's design is based on that of its predecessor, Chang'e-3, which deployed landing craft to the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. However, it has some important modifications.\n\nChina's lunar ambitions\n\nThe lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform the low-frequency radio astronomy observations.\n\nThe rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface.\n\nThe mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.\n\nChang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Nasa's InSight probe listens to Martian winds", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46489199", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The seismometer data has been raised two octaves to make it more audible (best with headphones)\n\nA UK instrument has captured \"the sound\" of the wind on Mars.\n\nThe British seismometer package carried on Nasa's InSight lander detected the vibrations from Martian air as it rushed over the probe's solar panels.\n\n\"The solar panels on the lander's sides are perfect acoustic receivers,\" said Prof Tom Pike, who leads the seismometer experiment from Imperial College London.\n\n\"It's like InSight is cupping its ears.\"\n\nProf Pike compares the effect to a flag in the wind.

This bell-shaped device will protect SEIS from the weather and allow the sensors to concentrate on their primary task of detecting earthquakes, or rather \"marsquakes\".\n\nCo-investigator Dr Neil Bowles, from the University of Oxford, said: \"To get the first data from the seismometer instrument package has been fantastic and even with a short test run the analysis is now full swing.\n\n\"To 'hear' the low-frequency rumble of the Martian wind on the lander being picked up by [SEIS] is really eerie and provides a strangely human connection to this very different environment.\"\n\nThe UK Space Agency invested \u00a34m in the seismometer package.\n\nThe organisation's head of space exploration, Sue Horne, said: \"This is brilliant news because it means we know the sensors have survived the rigours of landing on Mars and are meeting the requirements to achieve their science goals.\n\n\"It is just amazing to hear the first ever sounds from Mars.\"\n\nThe audio recordings released to the public are almost completely unaltered. In some cases, they have been raised a couple of octaves to make them more perceptible to the human ear.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Bloodhound supersonic car project axed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-46480342", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year\n\nA 1,000mph race car project has been axed meaning the supersonic vehicle is on the market for the price of a Ferrari.\n\nThe Bloodhound supersonic vehicle - built with a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter jet engine bolted to a rocket - is all but finished.\n\nThe Bristol-based team behind it was aiming to beat the existing land speed world record of 763mph (1,228km/h).\n\nDriver Andy Green said the car was now available at a cost of about \u00a3250,000.\n\n'Need a few million'\n\nIt was set to go for the record-breaking speed in South Africa, where a 18km-long, 1,500m-wide track at Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape has been prepared for it.\n\n\"You're going to need to find a few million to get it running to full speed,\" said Mr Green who added he knew a team of engineers \"who could help\".\n\n\"We have basically completed the main structure, the desert is ready, we just need the funding.\"\n\nPrevious test runs at Newquay Airport in 2017 saw Bloodhound reach speeds of 200mph (320km/h).\n\nMr Green said he would \"love to see the car run\" and said it was still possible that it could happen.\n\n\"If somebody is out there with a quarter of a million there is a car there.

Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.\n\n\"We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.\n\nA previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nJust yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers.\n\nWhile some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development.\n\n\"For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to.\""}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Zoologists Discover New Fastest Land Animal After Pumping White-Tailed Deer Full Of Steroids", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/zoologists-discover-new-fastest-land-animal-after-pumpi-1830946788", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "MADISON, WI\u2014Shedding new light on the now-500-pound forest-dwelling antlered ungulant, zoologists at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced the discovery of a new fastest land animal Friday after systematically subjecting a white-tailed deer to a regimen of specially tailored anabolic steroids. \u201cSome cheetahs can temporarily reach a speed as high as 75 mph, which for much of history made them the fastest terrestrial mammal.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., intervened Friday, talking directly to Trump about attaching the criminal justice legislation to the must-pass year-end spending bill, which is already tangled in a separate fight over funds for the border wall with Mexico.\n\n\u201cJust talked with President,\u201d Graham tweeted. \u201cHe strongly believes criminal justice reform bill must pass now. He also indicated he supports putting criminal justice reform bill on year-end spending bill which must include MORE wall funding.\u201d\n\nTrump has called senators about the bill and spoke briefly about it Friday at an event on safe neighborhoods in Kansas City.\n\nKushner project\n\nThe bill is a project of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, and would be the biggest sentencing overhaul in decades. It would reduce mandatory prison terms for certain drug crimes and give judges in some cases more discretion on punishments. It would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It also includes provisions to encourage education and workforce training in prisons.\n\nRoughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\nWhile Kushner has been meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, Trump is also hearing from allies who are against the legislation. Chief among them is Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is warning senators that Republicans will be blamed if criminals are released and commit new crimes.\n\n\u201cOnly thing worse than early release from prison of thousands of serious, violent, & repeat felons is to do that in a spending bill with no debate or amendments, forcing senators to either shut down government or let felons out of prison,\u201d Cotton tweeted Friday. The spending bill will need approval by Dec. 21 to avoid a funding lapse days before Christmas.\n\nCotton and others, including Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, No. 2 Senate Republican, insist there is not as much support for the bill as Grassley claims. Cotton says senators may tell the chairman they\u2019re in favor of it when actually they\u2019re not.\n\nThe bill has support from several conservative and liberal advocacy groups, uniting such disparate partners as the influential Koch network and the American Civil Liberties Union, but it splits law enforcement groups. It is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police but opposed by the National Sheriff\u2019s Association.\n\nAmid this divide, McConnell has been choosing caution, saying there\u2019s just not enough time to push the bill forward in the remaining days of the Congress.\n\nCriminal justice reform has traditionally been a Democratic priority, as Republicans prefer a more tough-on-crime approach. And McConnell acknowledges it\u2019s \u201cextremely divisive\u201d among Senate Republicans. Leaders tend to protect senators from taking tough votes that could have political blowback."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Appeals Court Won\u2019t Allow Trump Asylum Ban", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-won-t-allow-trump-asylum-ban/4692137.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "A divided U.S. appeals court late Friday refused to immediately allow the Trump administration to enforce a ban on asylum for any immigrants who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe ban is inconsistent with an existing U.S. law and an attempted end-run around Congress, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision.\n\n\u201cJust as we may not, as we are often reminded, \u2018legislate from the bench,\u2019 neither may the Executive legislate from the Oval Office,\u201d 9th Circuit Judge Jay Bybee, a nominee of Republican President George W.

But the largest changes were still to come. Kelly\u2019s replacement in the coming weeks is expected to have a ripple effect throughout the administration.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen current and former administration officials and outside confidants, Trump is nearly ready to replace Kelly and has even begun telling people to contact the man long viewed as his likely successor.\n\n\u201cGive Nick a call,\u201d Trump has instructed people, referring to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, according to one person familiar with the discussions.\n\nLike all of those interviewed, the person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.\n\nTrump has hardly been shy about his dissatisfaction with the team he had chosen and has been weighing all sorts of changes over the past several months. He delayed some of the biggest shifts until after the November elections at the urging of aides who worried that adding to his already-record turnover just before the voting would harm his party\u2019s electoral chances.\n\nNow, nearly a month after those midterms, in which his party surrendered control of the House to Democrats but expanded its slim majority in the Senate, Trump is starting to make moves.\n\nHe announced Friday that he\u2019ll nominate William Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, to the same role in his administration. If confirmed, Barr will fill the slot vacated by Jeff Sessions, who was unceremoniously jettisoned by Trump last month over lingering resentment for recusing himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nSessions was exiled less than 24 hours after polls closed. But Trump\u2019s broader efforts to reshape his inner circle have been on hold, leading to a sense of near-paralysis in the building, with people unsure of what to do.\n\nTrump also announced that State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert is his pick to replace Nikki Haley as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and he said he\u2019d have another announcement Saturday about the military\u2019s top brass.\n\nAll this came the same day that Trump\u2019s re-election campaign announced that two veterans of the president\u2019s 2016 campaign, White House political director Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, the director of the office of public liaison, were leaving the administration to work on Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cNow is the best opportunity to be laser-focused on further building out the political infrastructure that will support victory for President Trump and the GOP in 2020,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.\n\nThe moves had long been planned, and will give Kelly\u2019s eventual successor room to build a new White House political team.\n\nKelly was not at the White House on Friday, but was expected to attend an East Room dinner with the president and senior staff.\n\nAyers, who is a seasoned campaign veteran despite his relative youth \u2014 he\u2019s just 36 \u2014 has the backing of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law and senior advisers, for the new role, according to White House officials. But Ayers has also faced some resistance. During Trump\u2019s flight home from a recent trip to Paris, some aides aboard Air Force One tried to convince the president that Ayers was the wrong person for the job, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nTrump and Kelly\u2019s relationship has been strained for months \u2014 with Kelly on the verge of resignation and Trump nearly firing him several times. But each time the two have decided to make amends, even as Kelly\u2019s influence has waned.\n\nKelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general, was tapped by Trump in August 2017 to try to normalize a White House that had been riven by infighting. And he had early successes, including ending an open-door Oval Office policy that had been compared to New York\u2019s Grand Central Station and instituting a more rigorous policy process to try to prevent staffers from going directly to Trump.\n\nBut those efforts also miffed the president and some of his most influential outside allies, who had grown accustomed to unimpeded access. And his handling of domestic violence accusations against the former White House staff secretary also caused consternation, especially among lower-level White House staffers, who believed Kelly had lied to them about when he found out about the allegations.\n\nKelly, too, has made no secret of the trials of his job and has often joked about how working for Trump was harder than anything he\u2019d done before, including on the battlefield."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump: \u2018Go for it Mitch!\u2019 on Sentencing Bill", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-go-for-it-mitch-on-sentencing-bill/4692140.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s reluctance to hold a vote on a popular criminal justice bill has angered top Republican senators and created an unusual rift with a longtime GOP ally, Sen.

The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that\u2019s part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.\n\nThe low frequencies are a result of Mars\u2019 thin air density and even more so the seismometer itself \u2014 it\u2019s meant to detect underground seismic waves, well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks; until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.\n\nThe 1976 Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said InSight\u2019s lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt, of JPL in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe \u201creally unworldly\u201d sounds from InSight, meanwhile, have Banerdt imaging he\u2019s \u201con a planet that\u2019s in some ways like the Earth, but in some ways really alien.\u201d\n\nInSight landed on Mars on Nov. 26.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still on a high from the landing last week ... and here we are less than two weeks after landing, and we\u2019ve already got some amazing new science,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Lori Glaze, acting director of planetary science. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, it\u2019s fun.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "What?

Such back doors are unlikely to remain secret, meaning that hackers and criminals could easily exploit them.\n\n\n\nBack doors were central to a 1990s U.S. effort to require manufacturers to install a so-called \"Clipper chip\" into communications equipment so the government could listen in on voice and data transmissions. U.S. law enforcement officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, are again pushing for legislation that would somehow give authorities access to secure communications.\n\n\n\nThe Australian bill is seen by many as a beachhead for those efforts because the nation belongs to the \"Five Eyes'' security alliance with the U.S., Britain, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\"There is a lot here that doesn't make any sense,'' Schneier said of the Australian bill. \"This is a technological law written by non-technologists and it's not just bad policy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\"This was very important legislation to give police and security agencies the ability to get into encrypted communications,'' he told Nine Network television. \"Things like WhatsApp, things like that which are used by terrorists and organized criminals and indeed pedophile rings to do their evil work.''\n\n\n\nHe noted that the opposition Labor Party \"had to be dragged to the table'' and backed the legislation as an emergency measure out of concern extremists could target Christmas-New Year crowds.\n\n\n\nLabor lawmakers said they want amendments passed when parliament resumes in February. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said he supported the current bill only because he could not \"expose Australians to increased [national security] risk.''\n\n\n\nDuncan Lewis, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, noted during hearings that extremists share encrypted messages that Australia's main secret service cannot intercept or read.\n\n\n\nPresident Morry Bailles of the Law Council of Australia, a leading lawyers group, criticized the bill's swift parliamentary journey though lawmakers knew \"serious problems exist'' with giving law enforcement \"unprecedented powers to access encrypted communications.''\n\n\n\nAustralian law enforcement officials have complained that the growth of end-to-end encryption in applications such as Signal, Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger and Apple's iMessage could be the worst blow to intelligence and law enforcement capability in decades. Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said it hampers criminal investigations at all levels.\n\nApple argument\n\n\n\nBut Apple, in comments filed with parliament in October, argued that \"it would be wrong to weaken security for millions of law-abiding customers in order to investigate the very few who pose a threat.''\n\n\n\nThe company's iPhones, because of their strong encryption, are bulwarks of national security around the globe and help protect journalists, human rights workers and people living under repressive regimes.\n\n\n\n\"The iPhone is national security infrastructure right now,'' said Schneier. \"Every Australian legislator uses the systems and devices that that law will target, and making them insecure seems like a really bad idea.''\n\n\n\nApple also complained in October that the bill was \"dangerously ambiguous.''\n\n\n\nOne apparent contradiction confounds technologists. The legislation says the government \"must not require providers to implement or build systemic weaknesses in forms of electronic protection ('back doors')'' but also says it can \"require the selective deployment of a weakness or vulnerability in a particular service, device or item of software on a case-by-case basis.''\n\n\n\nTechnologists say that the mathematics underlying encryption and the way it\u2019s encoded into software make it impossible to decrypt a single user's communications without affecting all users.\n\n\n\nEric Wenger, director of cybersecurity and privacy policy for the U.S. technology giant Cisco Systems, warned during debate on the bill that Australia could be at a competitive disadvantage if its data were not regarded as secure.\n\n\n\nAustralia was a major driver of a statement agreed to at the Group of 20 leaders' summit in Germany last year that called on the technology industry to provide \"lawful and non-arbitrary access to available information'' needed to protect against terrorist threats."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Virginia Tech Students Unveil the House of the Future", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-tech-students-unveil-the-house-of-the-future/4689083.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Joseph Wheeler and his team of students and faculty from Virginia Tech University are convinced they are building the house of the future.\n\nJudges at the recent Solar Decathlon Middle East agreed, awarding their future house first place in the December competition held in Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe set it up in two days,\u201d Wheeler told VOA. \u201cAll the other teams took the full two weeks of construction.

Sign up for the weekly newsletter here.\n\nDear reader,\n\nA story from HuffPost U.S. this week looked at one of the key causes of gender pay disparities around the world: access to quality child care.\n\nIt focused on a report released Thursday, which found that 51 percent of Americans live in child care deserts, or areas with an insufficient supply of licensed child care. The lack of options, the report said, forces many parents (and mothers in particular) to sacrifice work to care for their children.\n\nJonathan Cohn, a senior national correspondent for HuffPost U.S., said he had a personal connection to the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a working dad married to a working mom. We went through all of this when our children were little \u2014 figuring out how to adjust our respective careers, in order to be good parents, and how to make sure the kids were in a good environment when we weren\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were extraordinarily lucky, because we have lived in communities with plentiful supplies of high-quality child care \u2014 the kind you get overseas, in the countries that really emphasize it. But that\u2019s pretty rare here in the U.S., and it\u2019s driven me to write about why that is.\u201d\n\nThrough his years of reporting on both child care and health care, he said he has seen the ways in which the trend disproportionately affects women. \u201cHere\u2019s what we know for sure: A big part of the wage gap is that women are more likely to drop out of the workforce, to take care of kids, than men,\u201d he explained. \u201cMany of them return, but when they do, they have lost seniority or fallen behind peers \u2014 and never catch up. Obviously this is a choice some women are making, but it can also be a choice forced upon them, in one way or another.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this, he said, is that we still live in a society in which men aren\u2019t doing their share. \u201cThat seems to be more about culture than policy. But there are other factors pushing women out of the workforce, even when they\u2019d rather stay in it, and one of those is the high cost \u2014 and generally low quality \u2014 of child care,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicy can definitely fix that. It\u2019s just a matter of commitment and resources.\u201d\n\nHis article describes the sort of policies that could fix the problem, but it paints a pretty bleak picture of the tough choices most American parents must make in the meantime.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nFor more about U.S. health care, social welfare and politics, follow HuffPost U.S. Senior National Correspondent @CitizenCohn.

Police were mounted on horses and surrounded protesters with trained dogs. A ring of steel surrounded the Elysee Palace itself, as police stationed trucks and reinforced steel barriers in streets throughout the entire neighborhood.\n\nAssociated Press reporters witnessed multiple protesters hurt in Saturday\u2019s clashes with police. Paris police said 30 people were injured, including three police officers. An AP video journalist was wounded in the leg as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on the Champs-Elysees.\n\nSome stores along the Champs-Elysee had boarded up their windows with plywood, making the neighborhood appear like it was bracing for a hurricane. Angry protesters on Saturday tried to rip the boards off.\n\nProtesters threw flares and other projectiles and set fires but were repeatedly pushed back by tear gas and water cannon. By mid-afternoon, more than 700 people had been stopped and questioned, and more than 400 were being held in custody, according to a Paris police spokeswoman.\n\nDespite the repeated skirmishes, Saturday\u2019s anti-government protests appeared less chaotic and violent than a week ago, when crowds defaced the Arc de Triomphe, set vehicles ablaze and looted high-end stores in the city\u2019s worst rioting since 1968.\n\nPrized Paris monuments and normally bustling shopping meccas were locked down Saturday at the height of the holiday shopping season. The Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum were among the many tourist attractions that closed for the day, fearing damages amid a new round of protests. Subway stations in the center of town were shut down.\n\nThe yellow vest movement \u2014 named after the fluorescent outerwear French drivers must keep in their vehicles \u2014 started as a protest against higher taxes for diesel and gas, but quickly expanded to encompass wide frustration at stagnant incomes, the rising cost of living and other grievances.\n\nMacron on Wednesday agreed to abandon the fuel tax hike, which aimed to wean France off fossil fuels and uphold the Paris climate agreement, but that hasn\u2019t defused the anger.\n\nAfter two weekends of violence in Paris that made the authorities look powerless, police went into overdrive Saturday to keep a lid on unrest. Police frisked people or searched bags throughout central Paris, and confiscated gas masks and protective goggles from AP journalists.\n\nProtesters who came to Paris from Normandy described seeing officers block yellow-vested passengers from boarding public transportation at stops along their route. The national gendarme service posted a video on Twitter of police tackling a protester and confiscating his dangerous material, which appeared to be primarily a tennis racket.\n\nMacron\u2019s government had warned that the yellow vest protests had created a \u201cmonster\u201d and that Saturday\u2019s protests would be hijacked by radicalized and rebellious crowds.\n\nDemonstrators waving French flags, shouting the French anthem and wearing the movement\u2019s signature neon vests gathered before dawn Saturday near the Arc de Triomphe, then tried to march down the Champs-Elysees Avenue toward the presidential palace.\n\nRows of helmeted, thickly protected riot police blocked their passage down the Champs-Elysees toward the heart of presidential power. So the protesters tried other routes, marching through the prime shopping district that includes the high-end stores of Galeries Lafayette and Printemps and the Palais Garnier opera house.\n\nNational police estimated the number of protesters in Paris on Saturday at 8,000, among 31,000 protesters nationwide. They appeared to be outnumbered by police, with 8,000 officers deployed in the capital alone and 89,000 fanned out around the country.\n\nThe yellow vests include people with views that range from the far right to the far left. The group has no leaders but is united in its feeling that Macron and his government are out of touch with the concerns of ordinary French families.\n\n\u201cWe are here to tell (Macron) our discontent. Me, I\u2019m not here to break things because I have four children so I am going to try to be safe for them, because they are afraid,\u201d protester Myriam Diaz told the AP. \u201cBut I still want to be here to say \u2018Stop, that\u2019s enough, this has to stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nCyril, a garbage truck driver in Normandy who earns 1,430 euros ($1,625) a month, said Macron\u2019s mistake was trying to reform France too quickly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have kids because I have trouble feeding myself, let alone another mouth,\u201d the 25-year-old told the AP, saying he came to Paris to demonstrate and \u201cdefend myself.\u201d\n\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner urged calm.\n\n\u201cI ask the yellow vests that want to bring about a peaceful message to not go with the violent people. We know that the violent people are only strong because they hide themselves within the yellow vests, which hampers the security forces,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nFour people have been killed in accidents since the unrest began Nov. 17. Christmas markets, national soccer matches and countless other events have been canceled due to the protests.\n\nProtesters also blocked roads, roundabouts and tollbooths elsewhere in France.

Yet while the country is scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019, Britain is as divided over the issue as it ever has been.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has agreed the terms of the \u2018divorce\u2019 with the leaders of the EU\u2019s remaining member states, but lawmakers in the British parliament still have to approve the so-called Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nIn ordinary times, a Conservative government with a simple majority would be able to get the deal through the House of Commons with little fuss.\n\nBut these are extraordinary times. May cannot rely on the support from members of parliament in her own party \u2013 much less Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been propping up May\u2019s minority government since her disastrous general election last year.\n\nPress Association Will Theresa May quit? Could Jeremy Corbyn become Prime Minister?\n\nAs it stands, as May bizarrely takes her Brexit plan around the country as if on the election trail, no commentator in the country expects the prime minister to get enough support when MPs vote on December 11. The only question, it seems, is how heavily she is defeated.\n\nThen what? That\u2019s where things get more unpredictable, with the outcomes ranging wildly from the prospect of another general election to no Brexit at all.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to what will be a historic week in British politics, however it ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nOn Tuesday, MPs began five days of debates ahead of what is described as the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement they are debating outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. The vote is expected on December 11, but even that isn\u2019t set in stone. Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\n\nWill May get enough votes?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSome 20 Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against May\u2019s deal, 45 have said they will not vote in favour and more than 20 have said they are unhappy with it. Their unease comes from, as they see it, the agreement aligning the UK too closely with the EU, and they claim May is set to deliver a Brexit in name only.\n\nGiven that May doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament, she will be relying on support from opposition parties. May\u2019s minority government ally, the DUP, who usually vote with the government to help them pass legislation, has also expressed its own concerns with how the deal risks separating the island of Ireland from the mainland as a trading territory.\n\nThe Labour Party, the official opposition, has also declined to approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the have concerns about the impact on jobs and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe bottom line is this: the chance of the deal being approved with the simple majority of 320 of the 639 MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat are the amendments?\n\nThe vote - or votes - may not be limited to the terms of May\u2019s deal. Labour has tabled an amendment outlining how MPs will \u201cpursue every option\u201d that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of May\u2019s deal or leaving without any deal at all.\n\nTory and Labour backbenchers have also put forward something similar, and there appears to be united front against the UK quitting the EU without any deal - or what is colloquially referred to as \u2018crashing out\u2019.\n\nIndeed, on the first day of debates, MPs voted for a motion that means if May\u2019s Brexit is voted down next week, MPs can effectively instruct ministers on what to do next and amend her \u201cplan B\u201d option.\n\nPress Association\n\nWhat happens if she wins the vote?\n\nIn the unlikely event that scores of MPs from across the political spectrum swing behind the embattled prime minister, it will allow the government to introduce the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to the Commons either before Christmas or after recess (the holiday for parliament), in January.\n\nWhile no guarantee of the legislation passing, it would suggest an orderly procession towards the EU exit doors.\n\nWhat happens if she loses the vote?\n\nYou would expect Theresa May\u2019s premiership to be over, right? While that\u2019s a likely outcome, it is not the only one. These are the most likely scenarios.\n\n\u2013 She could try again\n\nThis would depend on the margin of her defeat.\n\nThe European Union has been adamant this is a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 deal that cannot be renegotiated. But if faced with the threat of a calamitous no-deal Brexit and following a narrow Commons defeat, May might fancy testing their resolve and seeing if she can get at least some cosmetic changes to appease enough MPs to win a second vote.\n\n\u2013 Theresa May quits\n\nMay herself has been adamant that she will stay on as prime minister regardless of the result. But a defeat by something in the order of 200 votes - which would represent a rebellion by scores of her own MPs - and it could be the most elegant way out.\n\n\u2013 May forced out by a Conservative rebellion\n\nConservative MPs most strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal have already failed to oust May, struggling to muster enough support to trigger a leadership battle two weeks ago. But once the vote is over, other disgruntled Tory politicians could make their move.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum\n\nYes, taking the deal to the public is an option. May has ruled it out, and Labour has backed the idea - but only if they do not get a general election. It would possibly require an extension to the two-year timeframe to agree a Brexit deal, but even a senior Conservative has suggested another referendum could logistically be held by the end of May (the month, that is).\n\n\u2013 May calls another general election\n\nThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass. The Prime Minister could hope that voters will - via the ballot box - back her plan. Her fellow Conservatives are anxious to avoid this route after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament and a resurgent Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 Labour tries to force an election"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Luxembourg Announces Plan To Become First Country To Make All Public Transportation Free", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luxembourg-public-transportation_us_5c08d6ace4b069028dc685ac", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "In an effort to reduce traffic congestion and the environmental impact of cars, Luxembourg has announced its plan to become the first country in the world to make all its public transportation free.\n\nThe European country\u2019s recently re-elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has promised to lift fares on trains, trams and buses nationwide by summer 2019, The Guardian reported.\n\nAs the paper noted, however, some of the finer points of the plan have yet to be ironed out, including whether trains will still have first and second class compartments and if so, if riders will be charged in those cases.\n\nTraffic congestion is a major problem in Luxembourg, which receives approximately 170,000 cross-border commuters from neighboring France, Belgium and Germany on a daily basis.

One would undermine the governor\u2019s and attorney general\u2019s abilities to intervene in lawsuits; another diminishes the secretary of state\u2019s role in campaign finance oversight. They\u2019re even looking to limit the governor\u2019s ability to appoint a director of the state police.\n\nLast month, the lame-duck legislature voted to keep a ban on telemedicine abortions in place. And last week, GOP legislators passed one bill gutting paid sick and family leave and another weakening a planned minimum wage hike. The two policies would disproportionately hurt women, who make up the majority of low-wage earners and are more likely to need leave.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gretchen Whitmer will take over as Michigan's governor in January.\n\nThe GOP moves in Michigan are an attempt to \u201csilence women,\u201d the majority of voters who swept Whitmer and company into power, said Angela Wittrock, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally women saying, \u2018Here is what we want,\u2019 and men walking over and saying, \u2018Shhhhh.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Michigan is worth a closer look as an unprecedented number of women are set to enter Congress.

In Wisconsin, as Gov. Scott Walker (R) makes his way out the door, the legislature has passed measures weakening the incoming governor and attorney general, just as Tony Evers and Josh Kaul are set to take over.\n\nBoth states likely took their cues from North Carolina, which did something similar in 2016 when Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe Michigan legislature was also called out for its \u201cShame Duck\u201d strategy back in 2012 when it forced through right-to-work legislation.\n\nYet, Hart conceded, gender can\u2019t be dismissed as a factor this time around. She pointed to a contentious campaign for governor in which Whitmer\u2019s opponent kept \u201cmistakenly\u201d calling her Jennifer \u2015 apparently confusing her with Jennifer Granholm, the only other woman ever elected governor in the state.

(AP) \u2014 NASA\u2019s new Mars lander has captured the first sounds of the \u201creally unworldly\u201d Martian wind.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory released audio clips of the alien wind Friday. The low-frequency rumblings were collected by the InSight lander during its first week of operations at Mars.\n\nThe wind is estimated to be blowing 10 mph to 15 mph (16 kph to 24 kph). These are the first sounds from Mars that are detectable by human ears, according to the researchers.\n\n\u201cReminds me of sitting outside on a windy summer afternoon ... In some sense, this is what it would sound like if you were sitting on the InSight lander on Mars,\u201d Cornell University\u2019s Don Banfield told reporters.\n\nScientists involved in the project agree the sound has an otherworldly quality to it. Thomas Pike of Imperial College London said the rumbling is \u201crather different to anything that we\u2019ve experienced on Earth, and I think it just gives us another way of thinking about how far away we are getting these signals.\u201d\n\nThe noise is of the wind blowing against InSight\u2019s solar panels and the resulting vibration of the entire spacecraft. The sounds were recorded by an air pressure sensor inside the lander that\u2019s part of a weather station, as well as the seismometer on the deck of the spacecraft.\n\nThe low frequencies are a result of Mars\u2019 thin air density and even more so the seismometer itself \u2014 it\u2019s meant to detect underground seismic waves, well below the threshold of human hearing. The seismometer will be moved to the Martian surface in the coming weeks; until then, the team plans to record more wind noise.\n\nThe 1976 Viking landers on Mars picked up spacecraft shaking caused by wind, but it would be a stretch to consider it sound, said InSight\u2019s lead scientist, Bruce Banerdt, of JPL in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe \u201creally unworldly\u201d sounds from InSight, meanwhile, have Banerdt imaging he\u2019s \u201con a planet that\u2019s in some ways like the Earth, but in some ways really alien.\u201d InSight landed on Mars on Nov. 26."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg And Elon Musk Go At It In 'Epic Rap Battle\u2019", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-epic-rap-battle_us_5c0b9ebbe4b0ab8cf693bbd5", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Two modern-day titans of tech duke it out in the latest installment of \u201cEpic Rap Battles of History.\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who have previously feuded over the dangers posed by artificial intelligence, hilariously attempt to one-up each other in the spoof video shared online Friday.\n\n\u201cYour site\u2019s got so many Russian bots, they should call it the Social Nyet-work,\u201d fake Musk taunts faux Zuckerberg, who fires back: \u201cSet your self-driving truck to haul yourself home, because this battle\u2019s like PayPal, you got owned!\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Don Lemon Tries Listing All Of Trump\u2019s Failed Nominees, Doesn't Have Time", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cnn-don-lemon-donald-trump-failed-nominees_us_5c0b881fe4b035a7bf5b80ee", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "CNN\u2019s Don Lemon renewed his mocking of President Donald Trump for not delivering on his campaign promise to hire the \u201cbest people\u201d on Friday.\n\n\u201cThese are the best people,\u201d the \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d host sarcastically noted as he examined Trump\u2019s escalating war of words with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who he called \u201cdumb as a rock and lazy as hell\u201d earlier in the day.\n\nLemon then listed several other Trump nominees who have arrived and then swiftly disappeared from his administration in recent months."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Goes On All-Caps Twitter Rant About 'NO COLLUSION'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tweetstorm-mueller_us_5c0bbff7e4b035a7bf5ba5c7", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump went on an almost all-caps Twitter tear Saturday morning as he yet again criticized special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Trump campaign collusion.\n\nAFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION! \u2014 Donald J.

On the show he regularly tells stories about being an EMT, often referring to patients by racist slurs and comparing black patients to animals.\n\nAn anonymous complaint was made on Nov. 26 against McNabb, who works as an EMT in Patrick County, according to Marian Hunter, public relations coordinator for the Virginia Department of Health\u2019s Office of Emergency Medical Services. Because it\u2019s an \u201copen and active investigation,\u201d Hunter did not describe the nature of the complaint.\n\nHis continued employment as an EMT, however, raises ethical and legal questions about whether an avowed racist and white nationalist can objectively make life-and-death decisions for patients of color, Jewish patients and other minorities, experts say.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is espousing this type of vitriolic racism on a regular basis \u2014 it casts serious doubts on their ability to provide emergency medical treatment for someone who does not fit their criteria for an ethnostate,\u201d Keegan Hankes, senior researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told HuffPost.\n\nMcNabb has not been charged with a crime and will not be suspended from his job during the state\u2019s investigation, which could last up to 60 days.\n\nMcNabb didn\u2019t respond to a HuffPost request Friday for comment about the investigation.\n\nIn a recurring segment on \u201cThe Daily Shoah,\u201d McNabb assumes a persona he calls Dr. Narcan. In these segments, he tells his co-hosts stories about being an EMT. He regularly refers to black patients as \u201cdindus,\u201d a deeply racist slur common among the alt-right.\n\nDuring a Nov. 8, 2016, episode, McNabb compared black patients to animals. \u201cThe heat brings out the wild in the dindu,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cas winter approaches, the animals go into hibernation and the ridiculousness of the [911] calls goes down.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 4, 2016, episode, during a Dr. Narcan segment, McNabb referenced an apartment complex that houses people from \u201call over Africa and West Africa.\u201d He said emergency workers called it \u201cEbola Alley.\u201d He then called a black woman a \u201cDinduisha\u201d and compared her to a shaved \u201cHarambe,\u201d referring to the famous gorilla.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a dindu vein anyway, because they\u2019re black,\u201d he said during the episode.\n\nHe then told another story of an \u201cunruly young African-American male child running around\u201d an emergency room.\n\n\u201cAs it turned out, this young African-American male was there to get blood drawn, so guess who volunteered to take his blood?\u201d he told his co-hosts, who laughed in response. \u201cDr. Narcan enjoyed great, immense satisfaction as he terrorized this youngster with a needle and stabbed him thusly in the arm with a large-gauge IV catheter.\u201d\n\nVickie Gendraw, pediatric phlebotomy coordinator at Tufts Medical Center, told HuffPost she was \u201cappalled\u201d at McNabb\u2019s story. Medical professionals, she said, should \u201cnever, ever\u201d use large-gauge needles on a pediatric patient.\n\nTypically only small-gauge needles are used for children. Large-gauge needles, Gendraw said, \u201ctend to hurt, because the needle is large, and it bruises the pediatric patient.\u201d\n\nIn a statement sent to HuffPost over Twitter, McNabb wrote that \u201cDoctor Narcan is a work of fiction.\u201d\n\nOn the Nov. 30 episode of \u201cThe Daily Shoah,\u201d McNabb said he didn\u2019t treat patients differently based on their ethnicity or religion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a professional duty,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a fucking duty, to go out there and give 100 percent on every single call. It doesn\u2019t matter what race or color or what situation it is.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI mean, no one\u2019s going to do something to put their job in jeopardy or do something that makes them look like an incompetent asshole.\u201d\n\nMcNabb, who attended the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, has appeared on over 130 episodes of \u201cThe Daily Shoah\u201d (\u201cshoah\u201d is a Hebrew word for \u201ccalamity\u201d and is used most commonly to refer to the Holocaust), according to research from Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University who studies the far right. Titles of these episodes include \u201cJ.E.W.s Always Lie,\u201d \u201cAre You Ready For Some RaceWar?\u201d and \u201cBLACK ALERT! BLACK ALERT!\u201d\n\nHe appears on many episodes alongside prominent neo-Nazi figures, some of whom have openly called for exterminating Jews and blacks. Among these guests were Andrew Anglin, Christopher Cantwell and Richard Spencer.\n\nIn an article on the neo-Confederate website Identity Dixie, McNabb wrote that he \u201cwould certainly never complain if 911 calls for crackheads and morbidly obese negresses had to be picked up by black EMTs.\u201d\n\nMcNabb is an administrator of a Facebook group called The Final Solution to the Optics Problem, which features a Nazi flag as its banner image. The \u201cFinal Solution\u201d is a reference to the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews during World War II. \u201cThe Optics Problem\u201d refers to an ongoing debate in alt-right circles on how best to expand their movement.\n\nMcNabb also writes many blog posts on The Right Stuff, an alt-right website, in which he expresses vitriol against blacks, Jews, obese people and the queer community.\n\nThe website Angry White Men, which monitors white supremacist figures, first reported on McNabb\u2019s position as an EMT earlier this year. McNabb \u2014 who, unlike many in the white nationalist community, does not use an alias \u2014 made posts on social media showing himself in an EMT uniform.\n\nLast week, McNabb posted to Twitter that he was aware of HuffPost\u2019s investigation into his work as an EMT. He also suggested HuffPost lodged the anonymous complaint with the Virginia Department of Health. HuffPost did not file a complaint.\n\n\u201cAlex McNabb, to my knowledge, is a paid employee with Jeb Stuart Volunteer Rescue,\u201d Steve Allen, Patrick County\u2019s Emergency Services Coordinator, told HuffPost. EMT services in any given county often include a mix of volunteers and paid employees.\n\nHuffPost found no direct evidence that McNabb treats patients differently due to their race, religion or sexual orientation.\n\nRobert Veatch, professor emeritus of medical ethics at Georgetown University, told HuffPost that it\u2019s only ethical to employ McNabb if it can be ensured that he doesn\u2019t act on his political beliefs.\n\n\u201cEven if one holds that the white supremacist has the right to his views, he does not have the right to act on them while in a public role such as an EMT,\u201d he said. Medical professionals on a battlefield, Veatch noted, \u201care supposed to care for all casualties without regard to personal characteristics, such as loyalty to an enemy.\u201d\n\nStill, Jeb Stuart Volunteer Rescue would likely be within its legal rights to fire him.\n\nJ.H. Verkerke, director of the program for employment and labor law studies at the University of Virginia School of Law, said the First Amendment in a situation like this, while protective of a person\u2019s hateful speech, doesn\u2019t necessarily protect that person\u2019s job.\n\nRacist comments about patients, Verkerke said, would give both public and private medical employers a \u201cpretty strong argument that those statements signal problems with care\u201d and \u201creveal attitudes that are inconsistent with his duty of caring for patients properly.\u201d\n\nAn employer, Verkerke said, could also argue that a medical professional\u2019s hateful statements \u201ccould be viewed as disruptive to the workplace.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Democratic Women Are About To Lead Michigan.

In January, the state will have a female governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson. Attorney general-elect Dana Nessel will be Michigan\u2019s first openly gay elected official. Two are taking over from Republican men, and one from a Republican woman.\n\nDemocratic women are also approaching equal representation in their party\u2019s caucus in the state legislature.\n\nFaced with this apparently terrifying wave of estrogen, the state\u2019s male-dominated GOP is, to put it precisely, freaking out.\n\nRepublican legislators in Michigan\u2019s House are floating a raft of measures during this lame duck session meant to weaken the roles of all three women. One would undermine the governor\u2019s and attorney general\u2019s abilities to intervene in lawsuits; another diminishes the secretary of state\u2019s role in campaign finance oversight. They\u2019re even looking to limit the governor\u2019s ability to appoint a director of the state police.\n\nLast month, the lame-duck legislature voted to keep a ban on telemedicine abortions in place. And last week, GOP legislators passed one bill gutting paid sick and family leave and another weakening a planned minimum wage hike. The two policies would disproportionately hurt women, who make up the majority of low-wage earners and are more likely to need leave.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Gretchen Whitmer will take over as Michigan's governor in January.\n\nThe GOP moves in Michigan are an attempt to \u201csilence women,\u201d the majority of voters who swept Whitmer and company into power, said Angela Wittrock, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally women saying, \u2018Here is what we want,\u2019 and men walking over and saying, \u2018Shhhhh.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Michigan is worth a closer look as an unprecedented number of women are set to enter Congress. And it\u2019s a sign of how heated the political arena can get as women start chipping away at what\u2019s been centuries of male-dominated politics.\n\n\u201cIn the 40 years that I\u2019ve been here, I have not seen any such effort to curtail the powers of the governor and the executive branch,\u201d a Wayne University law professor recently told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nTo be sure, the GOP\u2019s mad rush to hold on to power is primarily about partisanship.\n\n\u201cThis is about a party of sore losers intent on keeping a hold on power as they see a group of incoming Democrats about to take power in Michigan,\u201d said Samantha Hart, the spokeswoman for the Michigan House Democrats.\n\nRepublican state legislatures are trying similar tactics in other places. In Wisconsin, as Gov. Scott Walker (R) makes his way out the door, the legislature has passed measures weakening the incoming governor and attorney general, just as Tony Evers and Josh Kaul are set to take over.\n\nBoth states likely took their cues from North Carolina, which did something similar in 2016 when Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThe Michigan legislature was also called out for its \u201cShame Duck\u201d strategy back in 2012 when it forced through right-to-work legislation.\n\nYet, Hart conceded, gender can\u2019t be dismissed as a factor this time around. She pointed to a contentious campaign for governor in which Whitmer\u2019s opponent kept \u201cmistakenly\u201d calling her Jennifer \u2015 apparently confusing her with Jennifer Granholm, the only other woman ever elected governor in the state. (Seen one lady gov, you\u2019ve seen \u2019em all.)\n\nWhitmer was also called \u201cunladylike\u201d for using a mild profanity in her popular campaign slogan, \u201cFix the Damn Roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the attacks that came from the Republicans were either dog-whistle or straight-up insinuating that the women weren\u2019t qualified or effective,\u201d said Wittrock.\n\nA lot of the attacks that came from the Republicans were either dog-whistle or straight-up insinuating that the women weren\u2019t qualified or effective. Angela Wittrock, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan\n\nWhitmer beat her GOP opponent, Attorney General Bill Schuette, by nearly 10 points in November. Her victory was a sharp rebuke to Democrats who saw Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory in the state as a sign that only a certain kind of white man could win an election, said Susan Demas, the editor-in-chief of the Michigan Advance, who wrote about the lame-duck shenanigans in a recent column titled \u201cWhoa, there, little ladies. GOP men will show you who\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\nWomen in the state legislature have also long had to deal with outdated comments and actions from their male counterparts.\n\nIn 2012, Democratic state Rep. Lisa Brown was barred from speaking because she used the word \u201cvagina\u201d during a debate about abortion.\n\n\u201cI have not asked you to adopt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adopt yours?\u201d she said at the time, then uttering the fateful sentence: \u201cAnd finally, Mr. Speaker, I\u2019m flattered that you\u2019re all so interested in my vagina, but \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhitmer, at the time a state representative, organized a protest on the issue \u2015 helping stage a reading of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d outside the statehouse.\n\n\u201cWe have a long tradition of trying to silence women,\u201d Wittrock said.\n\nBut women aren\u2019t down for being silenced in 2018. They flocked to the statehouse last Tuesday to protest the wage and leave bills, and more protests are expected next week.\n\n\u201cThings feel very personal right now.

Cohen also admitted to making hush-money payments to two women at the direction of Trump.\n\nIn another filing Friday, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York submitted a sentencing memo for Cohen recommending he served 42 months.\n\nAll three court filings provide new insight into where the special counsel\u2019s investigation currently stands. Here are some of the most interesting tidbits.\n\nMueller\u2019s Memo On Manafort\n\nManafort told \u201cmultiple discernible lies,\u201d Mueller\u2019s team said. \u201cThese were not instances of mere memory lapses.\u201d\n\nManafort allegedly told five main lies to the special counsel and the FBI.\n\nManafort's five alleged lies.\n\nThe alleged lies pertained to Manafort\u2019s interactions with suspected Russian spy Konstantin Kilimnik, his contacts with Trump administration officials and a transfer of funds to a firm working for Manafort.\n\nManafort allegedly texted with someone authorizing that person to talk to an administration official on his behalf.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that Manafort had contacts with Administration officials. For instance, in a text exchange from May 26, 2018, Manafort authorized a person to speak with an Administration official on Manafort's behalf. Special counsel's office\n\nThe memo also referenced \u201cinformation pertinent to another Department of Justice investigation.\u201d\n\nPortions of the memo are heavily redacted, specifically in the section on Kilimnik.\n\nSpecial counsel's office Portions about Manafort's interactions with Kilimnik are heavily redacted.\n\nThe Southern District Of New York\u2019s Memo On Cohen\n\nCohen acted \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of Trump\u201d to influence the 2016 presidential election, according to the memo.\n\nHis efforts included payments to allegedly silence Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York Prosecutors plainly state that Cohen acted at the direction of Trump.\n\nCohen sought reimbursements, which were illegally disguised, for orchestrating the payments to McDougal and Daniels, who claimed they had affairs with Trump about a decade earlier. McDougal and Daniels are referenced in the memo as Woman-1 and Woman-2, respectively.\n\nProsecutors claimed the \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d of Cohen\u2019s payments to McDougal was to \u201cprevent [her] story from influencing the election.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say Cohen saw himself as the \u201cultimate fixer\u201d for Trump, adding that he arranged the payments to the women \u201cto increase his power and influence.\u201d\n\nThis was not a blind act of loyalty, as Cohen has also suggested. His actions suggest that Cohen relished the status of ultimate fixer \u2013 a role that he embraced as recently as May 2018. Cohen was driven by a desire to further ingratiate himself with a potential future President ... and arranged for the payments in an attempt to increase his power and influence. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\n\nThe New York prosecutors rejected the idea that Cohen should receive leniency for helping investigators, noting that his crimes were motivated by \u201cpersonal greed\u201d and that he \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Cohen\u2019s cooperation with investigators \u201cdoes not make him a hero.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York New York prosecutors suggested a \"substantial term of imprisonment\" for Cohen.\n\nMueller\u2019s Memo On Cohen\n\nCohen has provided the special counsel\u2019s office with information about the Trump Organization\u2019s so-called \u201cMoscow Project,\u201d including who was involved in the discussions and contacts with Russian government officials.\n\n\n\nCohen also said he discussed the \u201cMoscow Project\u201d with Trump, who is referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d throughout the memo, \u201cwell into\u201d his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nSpecial counsel's office Mueller noted that Cohen's alleged discussions of the Moscow Project with Trump were especially concerning considering Russia's attempts to interfere with the election.\n\nA Russian national who claimed to be politically influential in Russia contacted Cohen in 2015, according to Mueller\u2019s memo. That person offered the Trump campaign \u201cpolitical synergy\u201d and \u201csynergy on a government level.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat same Russian national also repeatedly proposed to Cohen a meeting between Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin. Cohen, however, never followed through with the invitation.\n\nThe person told Cohen that such a meeting could have a 'phenomenal' impact 'not only in political but in a business dimension as well,' referring to the Moscow Project, because there is 'no bigger warranty in any project than consent of [the President of Russia].

Instead, they were shown to be generally healthier than non-migrant populations and to contribute positively toward the nation\u2019s sustainable development.\n\nEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services.\" Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch\n\nIn the United States, specifically, research has found that immigrants payed more toward medical expenses than they withdrew, meaning they were a \u201clow-risk pool that subsidized the public and private health insurance markets,\u201d according to a Harvard Medical School and Tufts University report released in August. That same report also found that immigrants made up 12 percent of the population but only accounted for 8.6 percent of total U.S. health care spending.\n\nBut despite their contributions to the country, immigrants in the United States face significant barriers to health care. Megan McLemore, senior health researcher at Human Rights Watch, told HuffPost that legal immigrants often struggle to access health care due to a five-year delay in being able to apply for Medicaid, and because undocumented immigrants living in the United States often avoid preventive care for fear of deportation, ultimately relying on emergency health services. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health issue,\u201d she said.\n\nTerry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report and chair of Columbia University\u2019s Heilbrunn Department of Population & Family Health told HuffPost, \u201cOne interesting thing to note is that the immigrant health of Latinos, for example, often declines in the U.S. due to poor health care, health food, total lack of accessible mental health services.\u201d\n\nDespite accumulating evidence of health care needs among immigrant populations, the Trump administration continues to propose policies that could further restrict these communities\u2019 access to health services. In September, the administration proposed making it more difficult for immigrants who have enrolled for public benefits like Medicaid to either enter the U.S. or permanently stay here.\n\n\u201cEvery time you make immigration policy more punitive or increase the chances of deportation, you\u2019re driving immigrants away from seeking health services,\u201d McLemore said, adding that Human Rights Watch is set to release an extensive response to this proposal because \u201cit undermines all public health objectives that you can think of.\u201d\n\nMcLemore also said her organization is collecting anecdotal evidence that shows immigrants are already hesitant to enroll in public benefits programs for fear that the proposal may take effect.\n\n\u201cAll of this is going to become a serious public health problem because whenever you are denying people health services [or] reducing access to health services, you are increasing the risk to the public health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for refugees, asylum-seekers, and other displaced populations.\n\nAccording to the UCL-Lancet report, the majority of migrants that cross international borders worldwide are either students paying for their education or labor migrants who contribute to their host country\u2019s economy. A significantly smaller proportion of this population are individuals forced to leave their home countries due to persecution, conflict or disaster.\n\nHowever, this small fraction of global migrants \u2015 refugees and displaced populations, of which nearly 53 percent are children \u2015 have the highest risk of exploitation, disease and death because they usually lack access to equitable health services in their home country and initially live in cramped refugee camps or shelters with substandard health services when they first arrive in their host country.\n\nIn the United States, this narrative can be seen playing out along the U.S.-Mexico border, where asylum-seekers crossing into the country are often placed in crowded detention centers where adults and children face an increased risk of disease transmission and mental health consequences.\n\nData on immigrants detained in the United States is hard to come by, but human rights advocates have worked diligently to put together a picture of what health care for these communities look like. A Human Rights Watch report released in June had independent medical experts analyze 15 cases of immigrant deaths in detention from December 2015 to April 2017. In eight of the cases, physicians found \u201cinadequate\u201d medical care had \u201clikely\u201d contributed to the immigrants\u2019 deaths.\n\nWhile these deaths represent a fraction of the tens of thousands of immigrants in federal custody \u2015 including nearly 13,000 children, according to The New York Times \u2015 the HRW report said the fact that the deaths were due to \u201cbotched\u201d emergency responses and \u201cpoor quality of care\u201d by officers and medical staff raised serious concerns.\n\n\u201cHuman Rights Watch has documented and continues to document inadequate health care in detention and that situation is just getting worse as the numbers of those detained increase and the facilities are overcrowded and are inadequately staffed,\u201d McLemore said, adding that the UCL-Lancet report only confirms what their research has shown in the U.S. for years.\n\nMcGovern said the discrimination and restrictions that migrants and asylum seekers face in the United States because of their status leave them vulnerable to negative health outcomes. Not to mention, restricting access to preventive care could mean a higher long-term financial burden on the country.\n\nPreventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or ... putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive. Terry McGovern, co-author of the UCL-Lancet report\n\n\u201cI think this report firmly establishes that preventive health care is definitely much more cost-effective than refusing to give people treatment or separating families so that children are traumatized or putting people in detention centers where infectious disease can thrive,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAll of those things are just going to ultimately cause more catastrophic health problems.\u201d\n\nThe solution, as far as the UCL-Lancet commission is concerned, is for governments like the United States to implement policies that give all migrants universal and equitable health care.\n\n\u201cWhen people are excluded from health services, they don\u2019t seek care \u2015 that means that chronic diseases and other conditions go untreated or unaddressed,\u201d Tessema said. \u201cThat has long-term consequences for the individuals and for the health system overall, which has to now care for people who would have otherwise been treated earlier with simpler and more cost-effective means.\u201d\n\nMcLemore agrees: \u201cLong term, when you have people either avoiding health care or going to emergency services when they get very ill \u2015 that\u2019s the most costly kind of health care there is.\u201d\n\nBut for McGovern, it\u2019s clear that neither health costs nor public health concerns are what\u2019s currently driving U.S. immigration policy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Humans Are Pooping Plastic, And No One\u2019s Certain How Bad That Is", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plastics-and-human-health_us_5c097d7de4b0b6cdaf5d3263", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "When Philipp Schwabl asked eight healthy people on four continents to take part in an experiment to see if plastic was present in their bodies, he had little idea what to expect.\n\nThe Medical University of Vienna researcher, who specializes in stomach disorders, asked them to keep a food diary for a week and record whether they had drunk water from plastic bottles, what brands of toothpaste and cosmetics they had used, and whether they had chewed gum. None were vegetarian, all had consumed plastic-wrapped food and most had consumed fish.\n\nThey were then asked to send a piece of their stool to an Austrian government laboratory where it was tested to identify barely visible microplastic particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters long.\n\nThe study, published in August, confirmed for the first time that microplastics are deep inside humans. All eight volunteers were found to have particles of most of the nine most common classes of plastics, including polypropylene and PET. On average, Schwabl found 20 particles per 10 grams of stool.\n\n\u201cI did not think all the samples would be positive,\u201d Schwabl said. \u201cThere is data on microplastics being present in shrimps, fish, oysters and mussels, but there was a question over whether they were present in humans. It is highly likely that during various steps of food processing or as a result of packaging, food is being contaminated with plastics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe smallest particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system and may even reach the liver,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need further research to understand what this may mean for human health.\u201d\n\nA clutch of studies looking at large plastic fragments in oceans has recently shown the world\u2019s most ubiquitous material to be present from the poles to the equator and to be a growing environmental hazard. Plastic in marine environments is now widely recognized to be a threat to many marine species.\n\nThe new awareness of plastic pollution is leading scientists to ask afresh how much the human body is being polluted.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Global plastic production has increased from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and is expected to triple by 2050.\n\nStudies have found plastic fibers and fragments present throughout the food chain, in plankton and fish larvae, bottled and tap water, seafoods, honey and salt.\n\nOne analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water. One widely sold brand had concentrations of about 10,000 particles per liter, and only 17 of the 259 bottles contained water that was free of plastic.\n\nOther research has shown plastic particles shed from degrading car tires present in the air we breathe in the street, in homes from the washing of synthetic clothes, and in the soil via sludge from water treatment works that is used as a fertilizer.\n\nWith global plastic production increasing from 16.5 million tons a year in the 1960s to over 364 million tons a year now and expected to triple by 2050, research is needed to gauge what effect growing human exposure to it may be having, say scientists.\n\n\u201cPlastic is non-degradable. It cannot be broken down and has the potential to persist in our bodies for a lifetime after exposure,\u201d said Stephanie Wright, a researcher at University College London who specializes in microscopic plastic pollution.\n\nConcern is growing that many man-made chemicals added to consumer plastics to give them qualities like stiffness or transparency may contain hormone-altering chemicals that have barely been tested. According to one study, detectable levels of bisphenol A, one of a group of toxic chemicals, have been found in the urine of 95 percent of the adult population of the U.S.\n\nPeople working in the textile industry have been shown to develop lung disease after exposure to nylon (plastic) flock, said Wright. \u201cContinuous daily interaction with plastic allows oral, dermal [skin] and inhalation exposure to chemical components. The potential for microplastics and nanoplastics so small they cannot be seen by the naked eye to cause harm to human health remains understudied,\u201d she said.\n\nMichael Warhurst, director of European chemical watchdog group CHEM Trust, has, with academics, identified over 4,000 chemicals potentially present in plastic packaging, of which 63 have been identified as dangerous to human health because of their potential to disrupt hormones.\n\njapatino via Getty Images One analysis of 259 water bottles from 19 places in nine countries found an average of 325 plastic particles in every liter of water.\n\n\u201cMany chemicals used in plastics have not been tested for their endocrine-disrupting effects,\u201d Warhurst said. \u201cCurrent test methods are not very good at identifying all of them.\u201d\n\nSome of the most common are bisphenols and phthalates, used in everything from food packaging and toys to floor tiles and water bottles. They have been connected to childhood obesity, asthma, cardiovascular diseases and even cancers.\n\nMany countries have either banned bisphenol A or advised that it may be dangerous to children. The United States\u2019 National Toxicology Program has \u201csome concern\u201d for bisphenol A\u2019s effect on the brain, behavior and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and children. It is still used widely in Europe.\n\nBut other bisphenols and phthalates are not banned and are used frequently in the production of consumer goods. Many, said Warhurst, may be similar or even more toxic than those banned.\n\n\u201cA lot of chemicals are very similar to known endocrine disruptors. When one gets banned, there are others behind it. Chemical companies are required to provide data but it\u2019s not always comprehensive. There is no strict enforcement and companies can bring chemicals onto the market easily. More research is needed and much better control,\u201d he said.\n\nOther scientists have said the danger to human health, if any, may be in the smallest pieces, or nanoplastics. \u201cMicroplastics will not enter a cell, but nanoplastics are small enough to cross into cells and permeate the body,\u201d said Anne Marie Mahon, a researcher at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Ireland. Her recent research found sludge in water treatment works full of microparticles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that chemicals could be absorbed in our circulatory system or pass into our organs. But whether that is happening is unknown,\u201d Mahon said.\n\nIn sufficient concentrations, chemicals can injure and kill cells in the human body, said Frank Kelly, chair of environmental health at King\u2019s College London and one of Britain\u2019s leading authorities on air pollution. He wrote with Stephanie Wright: \u201cThe cells may be replaced successfully or they may not. If inhaled or ingested, microplastics may accumulate and exert localized toxicity by inducing an immune response. \u201d\n\nTheir research is backed by Philipp Schwabl in Austria. \u201cIn animals, some microparticles have been found in the liver and embedded in tissue,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on the amount, this could cause immune reactions. It\u2019s possible that the minutest particles are in the human blood and tissue but it\u2019s very hard to measure and we cannot prove it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urgently need more research,\u201d he added."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Dwyane Wade Slams Critics Saying Gabrielle Union Was Acting Like She Gave Birth", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gabrielle-union-dwayne-wade-baby-controversy_us_5c0ae35ae4b035a7bf5b16e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "In an interview with Oprah Winfrey set to air Dec. 8, actress Gabrielle Union and her husband, NBA star Dwyane Wade, shared how hurt they were when, after the birth of their daughter in November, commenters online ridiculed Union for posting photos of herself practicing what\u2019s known as skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care.\n\nThe set of two photos, which she shared on Instagram on Nov. 8, show Union and Wade holding their baby, Kaavia James, who was carried by a surrogate.\n\n\u201cI think for me the most hurtful thing was once we had our baby and everybody started talking about \u2018Why is she in the bed holding the baby? Why she got a gown on? Why she acting like she just had a baby?\u2019\u201d said Wade. \u201cAnd once again, people are uneducated on the process and why we decided to go skin to skin as soon as our baby came out.\u201d\n\nIn skin-to-skin contact, parents hold their naked baby to their chest against their bare skin. Research shows that this kind of embrace soon after birth helps calm and soothe the baby; regulate the infant\u2019s temperature, heart rate and breathing; improve the blood glucose levels in newborns; and lower pain levels in babies. It can also help babies sleep better and give parents and child a chance to bond emotionally. And those benefits are especially crucial for babies born prematurely.\n\nFor parents like Wade and Union, who needed the help of a surrogate, the skin-to-skin contact takes on additional importance, said Dr. Shannon M. Clark, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and an associate professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who was not involved in the pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe importance of skin to skin for intended parents is that the immediate benefits that can happen with the mom who just gave birth to her baby would be the same for an intended parent who didn\u2019t give birth to a baby,\u201d said Clark. \u201cBeing able to do that as an intended parent \u2015 it\u2019s ideal.\u201d\n\nShe bristled at the accusation that Union was acting as though she just gave birth, noting that wearing a hospital gown with an open front is the easiest way to accomplish skin-to-skin contact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone who does that is trying to pretend that they gave birth,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s just for ease of use and ease of access in order to facilitate adequate skin to skin.\u201d\n\nUnion, who was diagnosed with adenomyosis, suffered eight or nine pregnancy losses (she lost count) before deciding to use a surrogate.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether the couple entered into a traditional surrogacy, in which the woman who carries the pregnancy uses her egg to conceive the child, or a gestational surrogacy, in which the gestational carrier is pregnant with the intended parents\u2019 embryo.\n\n\u201cSometimes people use donor sperm. Sometimes people use donor eggs. Sometimes it is the couple\u2019s own embryo,\u201d Union explained in another part of the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s all different kinds of routes to that. Whether the couple opts to share that with you should be on them.\u201d\n\nKaavia James was born Nov. 7.\n\nDr. Lisa Erickson, a retired reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist in Minnesota who has experience helping people build their family through surrogacy, said skin-to-skin contact is one of several ways that intended parents can bond with their baby.\n\n\u201cSome [intended parents] can be present at delivery, [and] some cannot,\u201d she said. \u201cKangaroo care is just one method to feel the experience of closeness.\u201d\n\nErickson said the bonding between intended parents and child can start even before birth, with the intended parents and the surrogate bonding with each other. For instance, she said, it isn\u2019t uncommon for the surrogate to keep a journal throughout the pregnancy and give that diary to the intended parents.\n\nClark mentioned that additional kinds of bonding can help intended parents bond with their baby during pregnancy, for example, by attending prenatal checkups to keep updated on milestones and letting the surrogate know what music and children\u2019s books the family plans to share with the baby so that the surrogate can begin listening and reading out loud to the fetus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit different for every couple and for every matched intended parent and a [surrogate], but there are ways to facilitate the bonding,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the hope is that once the baby is here, skin to skin, being involved with the labor and delivery process and being there for the surrogate or gestational carrier is the most important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways to build a family, and this is just one of them,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift of unmeasurable love.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Could Prescription Heroin Help Stem Opioid Deaths In The U.S.?", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prescription-heroin-opioid-deaths_us_5c0809bae4b0844cda4f5196", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "Yahoo Canada News A tray of supplies at the Insite supervised injection clinic in Vancouver, Canada, where people are permitted to inject illicit drugs in the presence of medical staff.\n\nAs drug overdose deaths in the United States soar and life expectancy drops, researchers are looking to unconventional approaches to help stem the nation\u2019s opioid crisis \u2015 including making heroin available by prescription.\n\nA report released by the nonprofit Rand Corporation this week analyzed the literature on two interventions \u2015 prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites \u2015 that already exist in Europe, Canada and Australia, but are still highly controversial in the United States.\n\nWhile prescribing one of the drugs at the center of the opioid crisis might seem unthinkable to the uninitiated, Beau Kilmer, lead author of the new report and the co-director of Rand\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center, explained that it can be an effective way to keep drug users safe if traditional treatments haven\u2019t worked for them.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just legalizing heroin or giving it out,\u201d he said, stressing that prescription heroin isn\u2019t a first-line treatment. Instead, heroin-assisted therapy involves offering pharmaceutical-grade heroin to people who have tried other treatments, such as methadone, and continued to inject. That dose of heroin would be used under medical supervision in a clinic, often with the option of taking methadone home to ward off potential withdrawal.\n\nThe researchers analyzed randomized controlled trials on prescription heroin in Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and found strong evidence to support that drug users who were prescribed heroin were less likely to use illicit street heroin. Unlike prescription heroin, street heroin carries the risk of being adulterated with other substances, such as fentanyl, the highly potent synthetic opioid implicated as a driving force in the nearly 50,000 opioid deaths the U.S. logged in 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that people who received prescription heroin had better social and mental health outcomes and were less likely to engage in criminal activity than those who received methadone.\n\n\u201cFor these individuals, not only does it reduce their use of street-source heroin, but it also helps stabilize their lives,\u201d said Kilmer, who explained many people who have been using drugs for an extended period of time spend a significant portion of the day trying to get money to pay for heroin, potentially putting themselves in dangerous situations.\n\nThe report concluded that it\u2019s time for the U.S. to pilot prescription heroin.\n\n\u201cGiven the success of these programs in other countries, and given where we are in the United States with fentanyl poisoning, we definitely think that there should be randomized controlled trials of heroin-assisted treatment in the United States,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nThe new report found less robust evidence behind supervised consumption sites \u2015 where people bring their own street drugs to inject, using clean supplies in a hygienic clinical setting under medical supervision.\n\nAlthough previous research on existing supervised consumption sites outside of the U.S. found that these sites reduced disease transmission and drove down emergency calls and fatal overdoses, the new report concluded that there were too few studies, from a limited number of locations, to draw rigorous conclusions from.\n\nOn the other hand, Kilmer pointed out that those supervised consumption sites have been in existence for between 15 and 30 years, and have withstood multiple changes in national and local government. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sites are effective, but it does suggest that if they have negative effects, they\u2019re minor ones.\n\n\u201cIf there really was a significant downside for the individuals or the communities, you wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have such longevity,\u201d Kilmer said.\n\nCultural and legal obstacles stand in the way.\n\nHeroin is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning there\u2019s no accepted medical use for it and doctors can\u2019t prescribe it. Human research on Schedule I drugs is permitted, but similar to the obstacles medical marijuana researchers run up against, prescription heroin researchers would encounter barriers, such as having to get research approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe new report suggests a workaround. It would be easier to start a pilot program on injectable hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid used for pain in the United States. There\u2019s less research on injectable hydromorphone than there is on prescription heroin. Still, the limited research that does exist suggests that like prescription heroin, supervised injectable hydromorphone could have physical and mental health benefits and reduce illicit street drug use, potentially making it a viable \u2015 and less stigmatized \u2015 alternative to prescription heroin, with far fewer regulatory hoops.\n\n\u201cThis is a drug already being widely used [in medical settings] in the U.S., so would be simply an incremental adjustment,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health science at Northeastern University. (Although Beletsky was not involved in the report, he did give the authors feedback on it.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more realistic to call for that approach,\u201d he added.\n\nSupervised consumption pilot sites face their own legal obstacles. Although the sites are being considered in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, a federal law known as the \u201ccrack house statute\u201d makes it illegal to use or distribute a controlled substance, and the Justice Department has threatened to crack down on any site that does open.\n\nI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s. Robert Heimer, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health\n\nMany jurisdictions seem skittish about the potential pilots. In October, California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed legislation that would have authorized the nation\u2019s first pilot program in San Francisco, although it remains to be seen what will happen when Democratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is sworn in next year.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to have to be willing to stick their necks out like they were with needle exchanges in the 1980s, and take some risks,\u201d said Robert Heimer, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.\n\n\u201cThese are as much practical implementations as they are scientific. Sometimes waiting for the science to provide conclusive evidence of anything really means missed opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no compelling evidence against, and there\u2019s logical reasons why these things might be expected to work, then just go with it,\u201d Heimer added.\n\nBut prescription heroin and supervised consumption sites were never intended to work in isolation. Instead, they are potential pieces of a much larger, multipronged approach to addressing the crisis.\n\nWhile a handful of big cities eye supervised consumption sites as an additional tool in their opioid crisis toolbox, much of the country lacks more basic harm reduction services. There are still few needle exchange programs in the U.S., particularly in rural areas of the country, and large gaps in access to addiction treatment.\n\nAs it stands, only 12 percent of people with substance use disorder received speciality treatment, according to a 2016 surgeon general report, despite decades of evidence showing that treatments like methadone and buprenorphine are effective. And even less controversial harm reduction strategies, like needle exchanges and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, still aren\u2019t as widely available as they should be.\n\n\u201cRural counties are at high risk for problems,\u201d but they need more fundamental harm reduction strategies in place before trying to create supervised consumption sites, Heimer said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the cities that are more practical first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasing access to methadone and buprenorphine must remain a top priority,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cIf you are talking about places that don\u2019t have methadone or don\u2019t have syringe exchange programs, I don\u2019t think it would make much sense to argue for these other types of interventions, which could be even more controversial.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

According to a former senior administration official, he has openly discussed with his allies the possibility of succeeding Mr. Kelly, something that has not gone unnoticed in the West Wing.\n\nEven if he does not end up next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, it has been a rapid and lucrative rise for Mr. Ayers since his start as a 20-year-old personal aide in Mr. Perdue\u2019s come-from-behind-victory as Georgia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction.\n\nLess than two years later, Mr. Ayers was named campaign manager for Mr. Perdue\u2019s successful re-election campaign, and after that, he took a job running the Republican Governors Association.

The prince and his advisers, eager to enlist American support for his hawkish policies in the region and for his own consolidation of power, cultivated the relationship with Mr. Kushner for more than two years, according to documents, emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nA delegation of Saudis close to the prince visited the United States as early as the month Mr. Trump was elected, the documents show, and brought back a report identifying Mr. Kushner as a crucial focal point in the courtship of the new administration.

In addition to offering to help resolve the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, the Saudis offered hundreds of billions of dollars in deals to buy American weapons and invest in American infrastructure.

The reprimands were first reported by The Times after a longer Times investigation into the ambush. The only senior officer to receive a letter of reprimand so far is Maj. Gen. Marcus Hicks, the head of Special Operations forces in Africa, who was already planning to retire.\n\nThe delays have led to recriminations within the military\u2019s individual fiefs. Army Gen. Tony Thomas, the leader of Special Operations Command \u2014 which includes Green Berets, Navy SEALs and other American commandos around the world \u2014 has complained that his troops have been singled out for fault. He has also leveled criticism that Pentagon leaders are protecting United States Africa Command, which oversees missions across the continent.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Mattis on Oct. 1, General Thomas blamed bad relations between Africa Command and the last commander of American commandos in Africa, Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, as one reason for the failed mission. The memo, obtained by The Times, said the internal tensions had \u201chindered the ability of commanders, at both levels, to understand, communicate, assess and mitigate risk as events transpired\u201d in October 2017.\n\nAnimosity erupted during the video conference at the Pentagon last month between Mr. Mattis; Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff; Mark Esper, the Army secretary; Owen West, the military\u2019s top civilian Special Operations policy official; and Paul C. Ney Jr., the Pentagon general counsel. General Thomas called in from his headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.\n\nMr. Mattis wasn\u2019t the only one angry, Defense Department officials said. Army officials complained to aides that Mr. Mattis and Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had contributed to the morass by allowing Africa Command, whose leader, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, is also a Marine, to essentially investigate itself by appointing General Waldhauser\u2019s own chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Roger L.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation. Tracleer, which is prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, sells in pharmacies for an average cash price of about $14,500 for 60 tablets, according to the website GoodRx.\n\nCaroline Pavis, a spokeswoman for Actelion, said in a statement that the company was committed to complying with the law. It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence \u2014 they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.\n\nBut federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies\u2019 treatments for the pulmonary condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Why Are Scientists So Upset About the First Crispr Babies?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/health/crispr-gene-editing-embryos.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-08 19:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "Instead, Dr. He went ahead and disabled a perfectly normal gene, CCR\u2085.

And there are simpler and safer ways to prevent H.I.V. infection.\n\nMore worrying, Crispr often inadvertently alters genes other than the one being targeted, and there are also circumstances, called mosaicism, where some cells contain the edited gene and others do not. Dr. He claimed in a video that Crispr did not affect other genes in the twins and that the babies were \u201cborn normally and healthy,\u201d but there is no way to know if that is true.\n\nIn fact, some of the data Dr. He presented at a conference in Hong Kong, after he announced the birth of the twins, is concerning, several scientists said. For one thing, it indicates that he was able to disable both copies of the CCR\u2085 gene in only one of the twins, whom Dr. He identified as \u201cNana.\u201d In the other twin, \u201cLulu,\u201d only one copy of CCR\u2085 was disabled, providing limited, if any, protection against H.I.V., but Dr. He implanted the embryo anyway.
