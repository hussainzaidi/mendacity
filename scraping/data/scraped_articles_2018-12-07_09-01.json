Witch Hunt!\" Trump tweeted, after quoting a Fox News host who criticized the probe.\n\nTrish_Regan: \"Did the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I don't think so. The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. Don't use Government resources to take down political foes. Weaponizing Government for gain.\" Is this really America? Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2018\n\nThe twin filings represent yet another dramatic moment for the Mueller investigation and are being eagerly awaited in Washington for signs of how the Russia drama will unfold in the weeks ahead and how much it may eventually hurt Trump.\n\nYet as with this week's feverishly anticipated sentencing memo about Trump's ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, the filings could bring a measure of disappointment to special counsel watchers if large quantities of evidence are redacted to protect ongoing investigations.\n\nEven if important context remains under seal, Mueller often delivers hints and opens loops in court documents that sketch a colorful narrative of the Russia affair, and may offer pointers of where a probe branded \"presidential harassment\" by Trump on Thursday is going.\n\nNeither of Friday's deadlines involves action implicating the President directly in any wrongdoing, more than 18 months after Mueller was chosen to find out whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian election interference in 2016.\n\nBut in recent weeks it has become clear that the special counsel is using proceedings and filings concerning key witnesses and former Trump associates to suggest a pattern of questionable behavior on the part of the President.\n\nIt's clear that Trump's behavior has worried officials at the Justice Department since nearly the start of his presidency. CNN reported Thursday on the frantic days that followed the President's firing of then-FBI Director James Comey , which led Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials to view Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time. Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before Mueller was appointed, the sources said.\n\nSince then, Mueller has constructed a tapestry of disclosures that started with an accounting of a hacking operation by Moscow's intelligence agencies and has unveiled multiple links between Russians and people around Trump -- and repeated lies about those contacts.\n\nFriday's activity will end an ominous week for Trump in which it has become clear that the investigation is far broader beneath the surface than is publicly evident. Mueller can now be said to be digging into possible collusion with the Russians, obstruction of justice, contacts with Russian officials during Trump's transition, possible campaign finance violations and the President's business secrets.\n\nA frantic Friday revolving around the Russia drama will also feature a return to center stage by Comey, who will testify in private to two House committees as Republicans throw their final blocks for Trump before handing over control to Democrats next month.\n\nAnd a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who was jailed for 14 days for lying to the FBI, will be released on Friday.\n\nIf that were not enough, Trump's longtime informal political adviser Roger Stone -- who is being investigated for alleged cooperation with WikiLeaks, which posted emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by Russian agents -- said he would not turn against the President.\n\n\"This is not about Russian collusion, it's about the parsing of words,\" Stone said. \"It's about process crimes and perjury traps, and I decline to participate.\"\n\n'Crimes and lies'\n\nMueller has pledged to tell the court abou t Manafort's \"crimes and lies\" t hat he said were committed after the uber-lobbyist signed a plea agreement and have sparked speculation the former campaign chairman is angling for a presidential pardon.\n\nThe disclosures from Mueller's team will be closely watched to see whether Manafort, who is at risk of spending the rest of his life in jail, lied about activity that could implicate Trump or senior campaign officials, or solely about the business interests in Ukraine that led to his downfall on fraud charges or other questions.\n\nManafort is an important witness for Mueller since he was at a notorious Trump Tower meeting in 2016 in which the candidate's son Don Jr. believed Russian intermediaries would deliver \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nHe could also be useful in establishing wheth er changes to the platform at the Republican National Convention that watered down criticism of Russia had followed requests from Moscow.\n\nLawyers for Manafort denied their client lied and will have a chance to challenge the special counsel's assertions before his sentencing date of March 5.\n\nIt is possible that some of Mueller's explanations will be blacked out, as they were in the Flynn filing. But a spokesman for the special counsel's office has said that at least some of the filing will be public.\n\nRoss Garber, a lawyer who specializes in impeachment, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Thursday that it was not normal for a cooperation agreement to collapse in such a manner, given the intensive negotiations that typically happen beforehand.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether anything new came up that nobody expected, but it is very unusual,\" Garber said.\n\nMueller's decision to come down hard on Manafort but to offer leniency to Flynn was widely interpreted as a sign that he will reward people implicated in the investigation who are willing to tell the truth about what happened -- but will tolerate no obstruction.\n\nCohen resets his life's 'compass'\n\nCohen has asked the court for a non-custodial sentence after he admitted tax fraud and lying to Congress about Trump's business aspirations in Moscow to preserve the President's political narrative that he had no ties to Russia.\n\nCohen's lawyers said in a memo that their client -- by turning on Trump, for whom he once said he would take a bullet -- had decided to \"re-point his internal compass true north toward a productive, ethical and thoroughly law-abiding life.\"\n\nSentencing documents filed by both sides in the case have connected significant dots in the investigation.\n\nLast week, Cohen pleaded guilty to misleading lawmakers about a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, which he had originally said had been shelved by January 2016.\n\nIn fact, the project was alive until June 2016, according to a statement lodged with the court by Mueller, who said Cohen had discussed the plan with Trump several times and had briefed Trump family members.\n\nThe revelations were important because Trump had insisted throughout the campaign that he had no business links with Russia.\n\nThey also raised the question of whether the President was beholden to Russia for a long period of the campaign and was shaping his complimentary statements about President Vladimir Putin to further his own financial interests.\n\nCohen has also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations connected to hush money paid to women who alleged affairs with Trump, which the President has denied.\n\n\"Michael kept his client contemporaneously informed and acted on his client's instructions,\" Cohen's lawyers wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\n\"Michael felt obligated to assist Client-1, (Trump) on Client-1's instruction, to attempt to prevent Woman-1 and Woman-2 from disseminating narratives that would adversely affect the Campaign and cause personal embarrassment to Client-1 and his family.\"\n\nCohen, who faced 46 to 63 months in jail under his original plea deal with New York prosecutors, is hoping that Mueller will grant him the same kind of favorable treatment as Flynn. The special counsel told a court this week that owing to Flynn's cooperation with the investigation, the former national security adviser should get no jail time. Redactions in documents accompanying the request made it impossible, however, to assess what that cooperation entailed and whether it put the President in any jeopardy.\n\nTrump has reacted angrily to the idea that Cohen could get a break from Mueller in return for his cooperation.\n\n\"He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence,\" the President tweeted earlier this week.\n\nDepending on the details Mueller chooses to unveil on Friday, it is almost certain that Trump's allies will reach for their familiar argument that the special counsel still has not proved any cooperation between Russia and the campaign -- the original mandate of the probe.\n\nBut with every move he makes, Mueller appears to be getting closer to the people who are closest to the President himself, so in the broadest sense there's every chance that Friday could effectively be another rough day in court for Trump."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "The frantic scramble before Mueller got the job", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/oXTnV7JUkgE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) In the hectic eight days after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials viewed Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time.\n\nThey discussed a range of options, including the idea of Rosenstein wearing a wire while speaking with Trump, which Rosenstein later denied . Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, the sources said. The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until after Comey was fired. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, according to the sources, and also included the President's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nThe new details about the genesis of the obstruction case into Trump that became a key element of the Mueller probe shed light on the chaotic week following Comey's firing and the scramble to decide how best to respond. They also help to explain the origins of the Mueller investigation that has stretched across 19 months, consumed Trump's presidency and is building toward a dramatic day of courtroom filings on Friday.\n\nA Justice Department official strongly disputed Rosenstein sought to curb the President, emphasizing that his conversations with McCabe were simply about talking through ways to conduct the investigation. \"He never said anything like that,\" the source added.\n\nOther sources said that the FBI would only take such dramatic action if officials suspected a crime had been committed. But Rosenstein and other senior FBI officials also had deep concerns about Trump's behavior and thought he needed to be checked, according to the sources.\n\nA spokeswoman for McCabe did not provide comment for this story.\n\n\"It's shocking that the FBI would open up an obstruction case for the President exercising his authority under Article II,\" said the President's attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported last year that the obstruction investigation started before Mueller's appointment, but the sources offered a more complete picture of the drastic actions law enforcement leaders took during that feverish period.\n\nPrior to Comey's firing, top FBI officials had discussed opening an obstruction investigation based on the President saying to Comey, \"I hope you can let this go\" when discussing Flynn. That episode was later described in memos Comey wrote following the February meeting that the former FBI director would leak soon after his firing.\n\nComey's attorney did not comment for this story, but pointed to Comey's 2017 testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nComey, however, hinted at the discussion in his book.\n\n\"We resolved to figure out down the road what to do with the president's request and its implications as our investigation progressed,\" he wrote.\n\nThen, on May 9, Comey was fired.\n\nThe subsequent meetings led by Rosenstein and McCabe were held soon after the White House made clear that Rosenstein's memo addressing concerns about Comey's conduct during the Hillary Clinton probe was central to the President's decision. One of the sources likened it to \"spitballing\" about potential steps in the mold of \"What are the options. What makes sense. What doesn't?\"\n\nFor the deputy attorney general, the obstruction investigation into Trump and the appointment of the special counsel has turned his entire Justice Department tenure into an awkward role of supervising the Mueller investigation after he -- voluntarily, sources said -- wrote the memo justifying Comey's firing. Critics have argued the Comey memo makes Rosenstein a potential witness in the obstruction case\n\nTrump's ire for obstruction inquiry\n\nOne source said there were \"different conversations at different times with different people.\" The President then raised the stakes, telling NBC News in an interview that he fired Comey because of the \"Russia thing.\"\n\nAmong the ideas discussed were opening an obstruction probe and appointing a special counsel, which were ultimately done in quick succession, less than two weeks after Comey was fired. Rosenstein also raised the idea of wearing a wire while speaking with Trump and exploring whether Cabinet members would invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Those additional ideas, first reported by The New York Times , were taken seriously by some officials but did not come to pass, and one source in the room has dismissed Rosenstein's comments on the wire as sarcasm.\n\nRosenstein's original public announcement appointing the special counsel did not specifically reference the obstruction issue, only \"the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\" But the order setting up the special counsel did include the legal code that includes investigating matters related to obstruction.\n\nRosenstein has been under constant fire from Trump and a frequent target of the President's tweets, and he was prepared to be fired after his comments about wearing a wire and the 25th Amendment were reported. He survived at the Justice Department but was passed over as acting attorney general for Jeff Sessions' chief of staff Matt Whitaker, who was seen as a loyalist to Trump and has publicly criticized the special counsel's investigation.\n\nBoth McCabe and Rosenstein have felt the withering criticism of the President. Just last week, Trump tweeted out a picture of Rosenstein in prison. Asked why he did that in an interview with The New York Post, Trump responded, \"He never should have picked a special counsel.\"\n\nThis week, Rosenstein joked during a speech to \"let the President know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.\"\n\nTrump has submitted written answers to Mueller's team about potential collusion between members of Trump's team and Russian officials, but he has not answered questions from the special counsel related to obstruction. It's still not clear whether Mueller will try to seek additional written testimony or an in-person interview from Trump related to the obstruction investigation. The President's lawyers have signaled they won't answer questions on obstruction because the time period falls under executive privilege.\n\nThe push for a special counsel\n\nIn the days immediately after Comey was fired, McCabe pushed for the appointment of a special counsel but Rosenstein seemed hesitant, despite many calls to do so.\n\nOn May 11, two days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein briefed Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and the panel's top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who were running their own Russia investigation. According to contemporaneous text messages between FBI officials, \"Warner conveyed that he wanted (a) special counsel\" and Rosenstein \"said he took that under advisement.\"\n\nMcCabe and Rosenstein later met with the full \"Gang of Eight,\" the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads, the day Mueller was appointed.\n\nSeparately, Comey was orchestrating his own campaign to create public outcry for a special counsel. The former FBI director had a key memo about his interactions with Trump leaked to The New York Times, which published an article that Trump had asked Comey to go easy on Flynn on May 16. Mueller was appointed the next day.\n\nIt is not clear why the FBI first moved to open a case just before the appointment of a special counsel. However, the investigation of the President could have been seen as an impetus for having an independent team investigate given the sensitivities. At the time, those pushing for special counsel were focused on protecting the Russia investigation from further efforts by Trump to curtail it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Jeffrey Toobin: Even Nixon didn't do stuff this crazy", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/LelCMDJ3tKk/donald-trump-rod-rosenstein-fbi-jeffrey-toobin-sot-vpx-ac360.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "CNN's Jeffrey Toobin responds after learning that after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials viewed Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: The Flynn filing should really scare Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/OR54MqYz1AQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The biggest story of the sentencing document filed by special counsel Robert Mueller's office on Michael Flynn is what's not in it. There are large swaths of redactions, making it hard to see exactly what Mueller is doing -- and what specific role the Trump administration's former national security adviser is playing in it all.\n\nBut there's a single sentence in the 13-page document that should send shivers down the spine of President Donald Trump and everyone in his inner circle. It's this: \"The defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government.\"\n\nPay specific attention to those last few words: \"Substantially assisting the government.\"\n\nAnd then remember these things:\n\n1) Flynn is the only one of the seven Trump associates who have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the Mueller probe who bridges the divide between Trump's campaign, the transition and the presidency. Flynn was an adviser to the campaign, a member of the transition team and, for about three weeks, the administration's national security adviser.\n\n2) Flynn pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017 . That, for you calendar buffs out there, is more than a year ago. We know from the sentencing documents that Flynn has met with the special counsel's team 19 -- yes, 19! -- times during that period. We also know Mueller has delayed Flynn's sentencing four times over the last year.\n\nWhat emerges from the sentencing document is this: Flynn may well be the key cog of the Mueller investigation. He's been less showy than former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. And less lie-y than former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But given that Mueller recommends no jail time for Flynn despite his crimes of lying to the FBI about the nature and extent of his contacts with Russia and Turkey during the election and transition, you can assume that the cooperation and information the former national security adviser has provided is substantial.\n\nFlynn was the first Trump associate to plead guilty and agree to cooperate with Mueller. And a reading of the sentencing document makes clear that Flynn is providing information and guidance regarding \"several\" ongoing investigations: 1) a criminal investigation of unknown origin and focus 2) the special counsel investigation into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election to aid Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton and 3) a investigation of unknown origin and focus.\n\nThat's a BIG deal. Instead of a single investigation into Russian interference, there are actually (at least) three investigations being pursued, to which Flynn has been of material aid. Three!\n\nTo be clear: There is ZERO evidence in either the sentencing document or the addendum to it that suggest Trump himself is a focus of any of these investigations. We can't say the President isn't a target -- because this is an ongoing series of investigations the details of which Mueller is working hard to keep under wraps -- but we can't say he is one either.\n\nBut if I am the President or his eldest son or son-in-law or lots of other people involved in the 2016 campaign, the transition or the administration, the sentencing document on Flynn has to make me very, very edgy. He's talking -- and talking and talking. And judging from the reaction of the Mueller team, it's not just idle words; prosecutors don't recommend zero jail time for someone who hasn't been of considerable aid to their broader efforts.\n\nThe words of Flynn on the day he pleaded guilty then take on even more resonance with a year's hindsight.\n\n\"I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,\" Flynn said. \"My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflects a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump in 2016: The mob takes the Fifth", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hxymM266-Vo/trump-fifth-amendment-bts-john-dean-ebof-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Kenneth Bernard Pius Hendricks, 77, originally from Cincinnati, was arrested Wednesday in the Philippine city of Naval after several alleged victims came forward to Philippine and US investigators last month, authorities said.\n\nThough court documents filed in late November cite five accusers, a total of 10 accusers have now come forward in the Philippines, alleging Hendricks sexually abused them when they were boys, US Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Steve Francis said Thursday in Cincinnati.\n\nBecause Hendricks also spends parts of the year in the United States, investigators are asking the public in both countries for information about the priest.\n\n\"It's horrifying ... abusive conduct,\" US attorney Benjamin Glassman said Thursday about the allegations in the Philippines. \"It's grooming children -- young children -- that are interested in being involved in church activities and taking those kids and sexually abusing them.\"\n\n\"He befriended them, he would invite them to his residence\" before engaging in progressively intimate contact, sometimes including oral and anal sex, Glassman said.\n\nUS law criminalizes certain illegal sexual conduct by American citizens abroad. Hendricks is charged in federal court in Cincinnati on a count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places , punishable by fines and/or up to 30 years in prison.\n\nHendricks was being held in a Philippines Bureau of Immigrations holding facility in Manila, the bureau said. His attorney in the Philippines, Mario Ope\u00f1a, told CNN that the priest maintains the allegations are false.\n\n\"As far as Father Hendricks is concerned, the allegations are not true and he will prove his innocence in court,\" Ope\u00f1a said.\n\nHow the investigation started\n\nHendricks has been a priest in Naval, a city of about 50,000 people in central Philippines, the country's Bureau of Immigration said.\n\nHe was ordained as a priest in the Philippines after arriving in the country in the 1960s, said the Rev. Benjamin Pantas, spokesman for the Diocese of Naval.\n\nThe Naval diocese is conducting a parallel, independent investigation, Pantas said.\n\nOf the allegations cited by the five accusers in a probable cause affidavit filed in court, the earliest dates to 2009. The accusers' ages at the start of the alleged abuse range from 7 to the teens, Glassman said.\n\nThe Philippine National Police began investigating around November 6 when two accusers, including a young man, came forward, the affidavit says.\n\nAmong the man's allegations, according to the document:\n\n\u2022 Hendricks began sexually abusing him around 2009 when he was a 12-year-old serving as a sacristan in a church in Naval. Hendricks first kissed him on the lips while the boy was cleaning the church.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would beg him to sleep at the priest's home, and the accuser believed he had no choice. The priest would insist that they bathe together, and the priest would have oral and anal sex with him.\n\n\u2022 Hendricks would molest him alone or with several other boys who \"resided with Hendricks during that time.\"\n\n\u2022 Hendricks said they \"would both go to jail\" if the abuse was reported to authorities.\n\n\u2022 The abuse stopped when the accuser was 15, after he contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAnother of the accusers alleged that Hendricks had anal sex at least a dozen times and oral sex more than 30 times, the Cincinnati US attorney's office said.\n\nIt's not immediately clear when or how the US Homeland Security Investigations agents got involved. But HSI agents interviewed the adult accuser and four other accusers November 26-28, the affidavit says.\n\n'I ... will have to probably really resign, retire now'\n\nHSI received a recorded conversation, purportedly between Hendricks and the adult accuser in November, in which the two apparently discuss the accuser having talked to police, the affidavit says.\n\nIn the recording, the priest said he's \"waiting for the fallout,\" according to the affidavit.\n\n\"There will be a meeting and then it will be decided, you know, what your parents want to do about anything. Do they want to try ... to press charges ... but that's between them and the bishop,\" Hendricks said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"They will decide, ask you what your decision is, what you're going to do, whether there will be a case or not or whether, you know, a settlement, I don't know. But as far as after that, I don't know what's going to happen. I really will have to probably really resign, retire now,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\nEventually, the affidavit says, the accuser asked whether Hendricks admits to having sex with boys.\n\n\"It's already blottered,\" Hendricks said, apparently referring to the accuser's conversation with police. \"You put it on a blotter. Will I lie? It was a mistake on my part. Should have known better than trying to just have life,\" the priest said, according to the affidavit.\n\n'Other children may have been impacted'\n\nGlassman, the US attorney, said Hendricks is not accused of abusing anyone in the United States, but investigators will explore the time he has spent in his native country.\n\nHendricks would spend several months a year in the United States -- likely in the Cincinnati area, after flying from the Philippines into Los Angeles, Glassman said.\n\nThe federal prosecutor said he didn't immediately know exactly where or how Hendricks would spend his time in the United States.

ESL says its plan would save 50,000 jobs. Sears employed 68,000 people at the time of its Oct. 15 bankruptcy filing\n\nFederal Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Drain, who is hearing the bankruptcy case, would have to approve the plan before Sears could be purchased by ESL. A committee of Sears' creditors has argued in court that the company would be better off shutting all of its stores and liquidating the assets to return the greatest amount of money to lenders.\n\nIn a court filing, the creditors' attorney called Sears' plan to become profitable \"nothing more than wishful thinking \" and \"an unjustified and foolhardy gamble with other people's money.\"\n\nLampert would be putting up a very limited amount of new cash as part of his bid. The proposal calls for $950 million in cash to come from loans that Sears would borrow.\n\nESL is offering to take equity stakes in Sears in return for forgiving $1.8 billion of secured debt that Sears owes it. That debt is backed by hard assets, such as real estate. ESL also proposes assuming $1.1 billion in liabilities, such as extended warranties, gift cards and points accrued by shoppers in its loyalty program.\n\nThe bid is for the assets of the company, including its store inventory and balances owed on its credit cards. Other assets included in the bid are its Diehard battery brand, Sears' home improvement business and the Kenmore appliance brand , for which ESL had previously offered $400 million.\n\nA spokesperson for Sears Holding declined to comment on the bid.

Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, the sources said. The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until after Comey was fired. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, according to the sources, and also included the President's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nThe new details about the genesis of the obstruction case into Trump that became a key element of the Mueller probe shed light on the chaotic week following Comey's firing and the scramble to decide how best to respond. They also help to explain the origins of the Mueller investigation that has stretched across 19 months, consumed Trump's presidency and is building toward a dramatic day of courtroom filings on Friday.\n\nA Justice Department official strongly disputed Rosenstein sought to curb the President, emphasizing that his conversations with McCabe were simply about talking through ways to conduct the investigation. \"He never said anything like that,\" the source added.\n\nOther sources said that the FBI would only take such dramatic action if officials suspected a crime had been committed. But Rosenstein and other senior FBI officials also had deep concerns about Trump's behavior and thought he needed to be checked, according to the sources.\n\nA spokeswoman for McCabe did not provide comment for this story.\n\n\"It's shocking that the FBI would open up an obstruction case for the President exercising his authority under Article II,\" said the President's attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported last year that the obstruction investigation started before Mueller's appointment, but the sources offered a more complete picture of the drastic actions law enforcement leaders took during that feverish period.\n\nPrior to Comey's firing, top FBI officials had discussed opening an obstruction investigation based on the President saying to Comey, \"I hope you can let this go\" when discussing Flynn. That episode was later described in memos Comey wrote following the February meeting that the former FBI director would leak soon after his firing.\n\nComey's attorney did not comment for this story, but pointed to Comey's 2017 testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nComey, however, hinted at the discussion in his book.\n\n\"We resolved to figure out down the road what to do with the president's request and its implications as our investigation progressed,\" he wrote.\n\nThen, on May 9, Comey was fired.\n\nThe subsequent meetings led by Rosenstein and McCabe were held soon after the White House made clear that Rosenstein's memo addressing concerns about Comey's conduct during the Hillary Clinton probe was central to the President's decision. One of the sources likened it to \"spitballing\" about potential steps in the mold of \"What are the options. What makes sense. What doesn't?\"\n\nFor the deputy attorney general, the obstruction investigation into Trump and the appointment of the special counsel has turned his entire Justice Department tenure into an awkward role of supervising the Mueller investigation after he -- voluntarily, sources said -- wrote the memo justifying Comey's firing. Critics have argued the Comey memo makes Rosenstein a potential witness in the obstruction case\n\nTrump's ire for obstruction inquiry\n\nOne source said there were \"different conversations at different times with different people.\" The President then raised the stakes, telling NBC News in an interview that he fired Comey because of the \"Russia thing.\"\n\nAmong the ideas discussed were opening an obstruction probe and appointing a special counsel, which were ultimately done in quick succession, less than two weeks after Comey was fired. Rosenstein also raised the idea of wearing a wire while speaking with Trump and exploring whether Cabinet members would invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Those additional ideas, first reported by The New York Times , were taken seriously by some officials but did not come to pass, and one source in the room has dismissed Rosenstein's comments on the wire as sarcasm.\n\nRosenstein's original public announcement appointing the special counsel did not specifically reference the obstruction issue, only \"the previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\" But the order setting up the special counsel did include the legal code that includes investigating matters related to obstruction.\n\nRosenstein has been under constant fire from Trump and a frequent target of the President's tweets, and he was prepared to be fired after his comments about wearing a wire and the 25th Amendment were reported. He survived at the Justice Department but was passed over as acting attorney general for Jeff Sessions' chief of staff Matt Whitaker, who was seen as a loyalist to Trump and has publicly criticized the special counsel's investigation.\n\nBoth McCabe and Rosenstein have felt the withering criticism of the President. Just last week, Trump tweeted out a picture of Rosenstein in prison. Asked why he did that in an interview with The New York Post, Trump responded, \"He never should have picked a special counsel.\"\n\nThis week, Rosenstein joked during a speech to \"let the President know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.\"\n\nTrump has submitted written answers to Mueller's team about potential collusion between members of Trump's team and Russian officials, but he has not answered questions from the special counsel related to obstruction. It's still not clear whether Mueller will try to seek additional written testimony or an in-person interview from Trump related to the obstruction investigation. The President's lawyers have signaled they won't answer questions on obstruction because the time period falls under executive privilege.\n\nThe push for a special counsel\n\nIn the days immediately after Comey was fired, McCabe pushed for the appointment of a special counsel but Rosenstein seemed hesitant, despite many calls to do so.\n\nOn May 11, two days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein briefed Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and the panel's top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who were running their own Russia investigation. According to contemporaneous text messages between FBI officials, \"Warner conveyed that he wanted (a) special counsel\" and Rosenstein \"said he took that under advisement.\"\n\nMcCabe and Rosenstein later met with the full \"Gang of Eight,\" the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads, the day Mueller was appointed.\n\nSeparately, Comey was orchestrating his own campaign to create public outcry for a special counsel. The former FBI director had a key memo about his interactions with Trump leaked to The New York Times, which published an article that Trump had asked Comey to go easy on Flynn on May 16. Mueller was appointed the next day.\n\nIt is not clear why the FBI first moved to open a case just before the appointment of a special counsel. However, the investigation of the President could have been seen as an impetus for having an independent team investigate given the sensitivities. At the time, those pushing for special counsel were focused on protecting the Russia investigation from further efforts by Trump to curtail it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller poised to reveal new details on Russia probe in Manafort, Cohen filings", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/mUPyNEO0dds/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's team could reveal tantalizing new details in its investigation into possible Russian collusion on Friday thanks to a pair of court filing deadlines involving President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nMueller's office has a Friday deadline to explain to the court why it accused Manafort of lying to investigators and breaking his cooperation deal. Separately, the special counsel's office and federal prosecutors in New York have to provide memos to recommend a sentence for Cohen -- filings that are expected to detail how he has cooperated in multiple investigations.\n\nThe memos from Mueller come the same week that the special counsel's office said in court Tuesday that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn provided \"substantial assistance\" to the special counsel's office and should not receive jail time.\n\nIn addition, former FBI Director James Comey is testifying behind closed doors on Friday before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees for a Republican-led probe into the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Also Friday, George Papadopoulos -- the first person to plead guilty in the Mueller probe -- is being released from prison after serving a two-week sentence.\n\nIt all adds up to one of the busiest weeks in the 19-month Mueller investigation -- and potentially one of the most revealing.\n\nManafort plea agreement\n\nManafort's plea deal was thrown for a loop last week when Mueller's team accused the ex-Trump campaign chairman of lying to them after he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy crimes and began cooperating with the Russia probe.\n\nThe special counsel must now explain exactly why it believes Manafort lied and what he lied about.\n\nThe key question is whether Manafort lied about matters related to alleged collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.\n\nManafort has extensive ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians dating back a decade and was in close contact with a Russian-intelligence linked political operative named Konstantin Kilimnik through this year. His years of earning millions from Ukrainian political consulting led to his conviction for tax fraud and banking crimes this summer. Following that conviction, Manafort admitted to several other lobbying and business crimes and agreed to help Mueller.\n\nManafort lied \"on a variety of subject matters\" after meeting with them several times, prosecutors alleged in a court filing last week. Manafort has disputed the accusation that he lied.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel's office has said at least part of the Manafort memo would be made public. Like in Flynn's case earlier this week, some of it could be sealed if the details would reveal parts of still-ongoing investigations.\n\nCohen sentencing memo\n\nThe special counsel could also reveal new information about its investigation when it provides a memo Friday recommending a sentence for Cohen.\n\nCohen's case took a twist last week when he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent of talks with Trump involving Trump Tower Moscow, which he had said ended in January 2016. In fact, discussions about the project went as late as June 2016, his plea revealed, and Cohen said in court that he lied \"out of loyalty to Individual-1,\" a reference to Trump.\n\nCohen already pleaded guilty earlier this year to eight counts in a separate case from the Manhattan US attorney's office. As part of his plea deal with that office, Cohen faced a likely sentence of 46 to 63 months in prison, but his newly minted cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors may substantially reduce that.\n\nCohen, who is set to be sentenced in both the special counsel and Manhattan US attorney cases on December 12, asked a judge last week for no prison time. While he pleaded guilty to tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations connected to hush-money payments to women who claimed affairs with Trump, Cohen's lawyers said has earned leniency because of his cooperation with multiple federal and state investigations.\n\nCohen's attorneys wrote that he sat for seven voluntary interviews with the special counsel and continues to make himself available as needed.\n\nHis cooperation has sparked a backlash from Trump, who slammed Cohen in a tweet this week and said Cohen should \"serve a full and complete sentence.\"\n\nMueller recommends no jail for Flynn\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller's team released some new details about its investigation when it recommended no jail time for Flynn -- but also left a lot to the imagination with lengthy redactions detailing the \"substantial assistance\" Flynn gave to the Justice Department.\n\nMueller's sentencing memo stated that Flynn had been interviewed 19 times, and he provided information for at least three investigations. But details of some of the investigations were completely redacted in the document, beyond stating that one was a \"criminal investigation.\"\n\n\"While this addendum seeks to provide a comprehensive description of the benefit the government has thus far obtained from the defendant's substantial assistance, some of that benefit may not be fully realized at this time because the investigations in which he has provided assistance are ongoing,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nStill, prosecutors said Flynn's early cooperation was \"particularly valuable\" because of his insight and the fact his cooperation encouraged others to talk as well.\n\nFlynn was Trump's first national security adviser, but was fired less than a month into his tenure over misleading the White House about his discussions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in December 2017.

Barr, 68, has previously offered mixed opinions about the investigation, having praised Mueller but also publicly criticizing political donations made by several members of his team.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that Barr is the leading candidate. Sources cautioned to CNN, however, that Trump makes the final decision.\n\nBarr served as Mueller's boss when he was attorney general in the early 1990s and Mueller led the criminal division at the Justice Department.\n\nThe former attorney general hasn't shied away from weighing in on Mueller's investigation. He expressed confidence in Mueller early on and suggested the investigation wouldn't devolve into a \"witch hunt,\" but he also has shared some disappointment when asked by The Washington Post last year about the donations that some of Mueller's team members made to Democrats.\n\n\"In my view, prosecutors who make political contributions are identifying fairly strongly with a political party ... I would have liked to see him have more balance on this group,\" he said in July 2017.\n\nBarr also defended Trump's decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, who was criticized for flouting Justice Department protocols when he announced in July 2016 that he wouldn't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified info during her time as secretary of state.\n\n\"I think it is quite understandable that the administration would not want an FBI director who did not recognize established limits on his powers,\" Barr wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in May 2017. \"It is telling that none of the president's critics are challenging the decision on the merits.\"\n\nThe prospect of Barr taking over the Justice Department was well-received by some leading members of Congress in both parties Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, called Barr an \"interesting pick.\"\n\n\"I think getting the next nominee confirmed is going to be a little bit of a challenge,\" he said. \"(Barr) may be the kind of person who would be easier to confirm.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she was unfamiliar with Barr's views but encouraged by a suggestion that he was an \"establishment\" Republican.\n\n\"I would hope (Trump) would pick someone who would be by the book and not by the politics,\" Feinstein said.\n\nAt the time, CNN reported that Trump was considering tapping the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, to succeed acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. At the time, White House officials said Trump was in no rush to nominate a permanent successor to Sessions, whom he fired November 7. Instead, Trump was telling confidantes he was happy to leave Whitaker in place while he mulled his choices.\n\nOther names that have been floated as possible replacements for Sessions include Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, a former federal prosecutor, as well John Michael Luttig, a former US Court of Appeals judge, Justice Department official and current general counsel at Boeing. One former White House official said late last month that Luttig was a strong possibility, though he had not met with the President.

Pompeo has told aides he wants the UN position downgraded from the Cabinet-level job Haley had insisted on, an official familiar with his remark told CNN. Elevating Haley to a Cabinet level post broke with the tradition of previous Republican administrations.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton has been said to want the role downgraded as well, according to people familiar with his thinking. A former UN ambassador himself, Bolton has taken an interest in some UN matters, such as the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe shift means Nauert would wield less clout than her predecessor, both at the UN and within the administration, and as a result, would pose nowhere near the challenge to Bolton, White House chief of staff John Kelly or Pompeo.\n\nThe nomination was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nLoyalty above experience\n\nExperience matters less to the President, an avid fan of Fox News, than Nauert's loyalty to the White House, the fact that she's a woman and her ability to be a polished proxy on television, according to sources familiar with his thinking.\n\nWhile Nauert struggled during the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- so ostracized from his inner circle that she considered quitting -- she could now bring to the UN close ties to the White House and a good working relationship with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nDuring Pompeo's tenure, she has been able to travel on official trips -- something Tillerson blocked her from doing -- and rose to temporarily hold the position of acting under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.\n\nDespite Nauert's TV savvy, however, current and former colleagues wonder if she will be prepared or equipped to navigate the gritty behind the scenes work of UN negotiations.\n\nShe would be taking the position amid a roster of thorny global challenges, ranging from North Korea's nuclear program to Yemen's famine and the growing divide between the US and its closest allies over the Iran nuclear deal, climate change and other issues.\n\nHarsh critics\n\nShe would also pick up the baton amid a US retrenchment from the world body, with Washington pulling out of different agencies and cutting or reducing funding for others.\n\nCritics were harsh about the nomination.\n\n\"Heather Nauert brings no experience, no understanding and, frankly, no interest in learning,\" said Brian Dixon, a senior vice president at Population Connection Action Fund, an organization focused on access to international family planning. \"Her main claim to this role is her willingness to defend the indefensible as a spokesperson. It's hard to believe that this president could further diminish the view of the United States in the world, but this appointment is likely to do it.\"\n\nAt the UN, Nauert is seen as a cipher. \"People don't know very much about her,\" said Richard Gowan, a senior fellow at the UN University. \"People are cautious.\"\n\n\"If Nauert is nominated and approved, people will be interested to see whether she's willing and able to do the diplomatic toil or whether she will see this as an extension of the spokesman position and focus more on presentation of US position before the Security Council,\" said Gowan.\n\nPresentation skills\n\nThe Illinois native would follow in the footsteps of Haley, a former governor of South Carolina; Samantha Power, a Pulitzer Prize winner; Susan Rice, a Rhodes Scholar; and former National Security Council and national security officials such as Madeleine Albright. If Nauert is confirmed for the job, it would cap a precipitous rise in diplomacy in less than two years.\n\nEarly in her career, Nauert worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department, which says she studied at Mount Vernon Seminary and College, a private women's college in Washington DC, and Columbia University's journalism school.\n\nNauert joined the Trump administration after more than 20 years in journalism spent largely at Fox News, where she led breaking news coverage for \"Fox & Friends,\" with a brief stint as a general assignment reporter at ABC.\n\nUN diplomats say that behind the scenes negotiations are central to an ambassador's job, and that presentation skills are also important.\n\nSparring with Russians\n\n\"The personal dimension is pretty important and you're dealing with some pretty tough customers, the Russians in particular,\" said Gowan. He noted that \"people were slightly denigrating about Haley too, because of her relative lack of experience and the general view is that she did quite well.\"\n\n\"No one wants to prejudge how Nauert will perform,\" he adds, noting that \"she'll be working with a pretty professional team and if Nauert is willing to trust the diplomats, they will have her back.\"\n\n\"With Pompeo more firmly in control and Bolton focused on his anti-multilateral agenda, there's a sense the US ambassador will have less clout,\" Gowan said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolduan: World laughed at Trump ... literally Replay More Videos ...

But a new series of papers presented at a UN Intergovernmental Conference this week and published Wednesday in the journal Lancet says that, based on evidence, that's not true.\n\nMost migrants have a mortality advantage, or greater life expectancy, than people in their host countries, according to the new research . This was true for the majority of diseases.\n\nHowever, separating migrants from their families can be bad for children's health, as can keeping them in detention or continuously threatening them with deportation, the research showed.\n\nMore than 1 billion people were \"on the move\" around the world this year, and a quarter of them were crossing international borders, according to researchers who worked on the report.\n\nWith so many people on the move or having moved in 2018, the authors argue that \"migration is the defining issue of our time,\" particularly as nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment grows\n\n1 billion people on the move\n\n\"In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda. With one billion people on the move today, growing populations in many regions of the world, and the rising aspirations of a new generation of young people, migration is not going away. Migrants commonly contribute more to the economy than they cost, and how we shape their health and wellbeing today will impact our societies for generations to come. There is no more pressing issue in global health,\" Dr. Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, said in a statement about the report.\n\nThe authors analyzed a large number of studies to come to this conclusion. The data comes from all over the world, but most came from high-income countries, so the authors caution that the findings may or may not be true for migrants who move to middle- or low-income countries. The data also rarely mentions why the person has moved, so it's unclear whether it reflects the health of those who are seeking asylum or are undocumented.\n\nalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although The reportsalso do not get at why migrants have a mortality advantage, although earlier studies have shown that the majority of people who migrate do so for work, and logically, they'd have to be healthy enough to do that work.\n\nAsian and Latin American migrants fare best when it comes to mortality advantage, according to the research. Those from Africa and Eastern Europe have a higher mortality than the general populations of the countries to which they move.\n\nThough migrants had a mortality advantage with the majority of disease, there is one exception: death from infections. That might, in part, mean the host countries have much lower infectious disease death rates than the countries the migrants left.\n\nThe other public health problem for migrants is death from assault, prompting the authors to call for better public health programs that would reduce the racism and xenophobia that can lead to violence against them.\n\nSaying they carry disease, are more violent or will be a drain on the economy, as some commentators have claimed, is not helpful rhetoric.\n\nOther papers in the Lancet series show that anti-migrant rhetoric is not merely wrong, it's harmful. When nationalism of this nature creates an \"us vs. them,\" the papers said, it becomes a \"moral emergency\" that leads politicians to create policy that hurts migrants rather than helping them.\n\n\"Too often, government policies prioritise the politics of xenophobia and racism over their responsibilities to act forcefully to counter them. Racial and ethnic discrimination fuel the exclusion of migrant populations, not only violating the rights of individuals, but hindering social cohesion and progress of society at large,\" report author Bernadette Kumar of the Norwegian Institute for Public Health said in a statement . \"Racism and prejudice should be confronted with a zero-tolerance approach.\"\n\nThe authors conclude that the political conversation about migrants needs to be reframed from one that is \"dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about the risks associated with migration and health, to one that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly supports the benefits migrants provide to high income countries.\"\n\nCreating new health impacts\n\n\"I think it's really important for us to get evidence-based work out there, especially right now,\" said Terry McGovern, an author of the reports and chair of population and family health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Immigrants don't have more diseases. They aren't more violent than the general population. This shows these are myths.\n\n\"We hope people will begin to hear this evidence rather than the populist rhetoric that is destroying people's lives. Migrants aren't coming in and overwhelming our health care system or exploiting the system. The evidence refutes this,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a government tear gassing children or separating them from their parents, you are creating new and permanent harmful health impacts rather than making it better for them,\" McGovern said.\n\nMany medical associations have expressed concern about a Trump administration proposal to make it harder for legal immigrants to get green cards if they get certain kinds of public assistance, including health insurance and food stamps.\n\n\"Penalizing migrants for accessing health programs -- that is not sound policy and will lead to more cost, not to mention the human rights implications,\" McGovern said.\n\nanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care. Another study in this group of reportsanalyzed research into the health of children when one or both parents migrates without them. This study found that children who were left behind had worse health, even if their parents sent money home for their care.\n\nMental disorders seemed to be the biggest challenge, the study showed. Children had a much higher risk of depression and anxiety. They struggled with drugs more, experienced eating problems, had behavioral issues and thought about suicide. Kids whose moms migrated suffered more than if their fathers left.\n\nIt wasn't all bad news. These children didn't seem to be any worse off when it came to general nutrition-related issues, abuse, unintentional injury or stomach problems.\n\nThere are no specific estimates available on how many children live in these circumstances, but the authors suggest that it may be in the hundreds of millions. Rural China, which has a disproportionate share, has 61 million children living without one or both migrant parents, the study said. For kids in rural South Africa, it's more than 40%.\n\nBecause the data in this study comes largely from studies in China, it may be hard to draw conclusions for migrant groups from other countries, said Dr. Julie Linton, co-chair of American Academy of Pediatrics Special Interest Group on Immigrant Health.\n\n\"For Latin American migrants, circumstances are very different, so I don't know how general that research may be, but what I take away from this is that family separation is detrimental to child health and well-being and that keeping families together whenever possible is best,\" Linton said.\n\nThe authors argue that global leaders should create programs to help the health of these children. They also suggest that migrant workers should be given time and the means to keep in contact with the families they've left behind.\n\nMaking the case for better conditions\n\nfor better living conditions. \"I'm really happy to see any study about migrants.

Often, the men live in barracks and sleep in the same rooms. \"So if one gets the flu, they all get it, or if there is poor food storage, salmonella could be a problem,\" Wold said.

Yet for decades, those opposed to abortion have sought to prohibit using federal funds to support research using human fetal tissue.\n\nFetal tissue is used to make commonly used vaccines\n\n\"Since the 1930s, fetal tissue has been a critical component of biomedical science and breakthroughs that fundamentally changed the practice of medicine,\" Doan said. She added that fetal tissue was used in the development of \"the polio vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives and merited the 1954 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\"\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, explains in an educational video on the hospital's website that five commonly used contemporary vaccines are made using fetal cells: rubella (German measles) vaccine, hepatitis A virus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, shingles vaccine and rabies vaccine , which is usually given to people bitten by animals that might transmit the rare disease.\n\nUnlike bacteria, viruses on which vaccines are based cannot grow outside cells; they tend to grow better in human cells, and fetal cells are best, he noted.\n\n\"There were two elective abortions that were performed in the early 1960s. One was performed in England; the other was performed in Sweden. And those two elective abortions then created cells which have been used ever since,\" according to Offit.\n\nDespite the usefulness of fetal cells when making vaccines, in 1988, HHS placed a moratorium on federal funding of research using human fetal tissue from elective abortions. Also that year, Congress passed an amendment (that President Ronald Reagan signed into law) to the National Organ Transplant Act that prohibited the transfer of human organs, including fetal organs and their subparts, for \"valuable consideration, or payment.\"\n\nPresident Clinton lifted the moratorium in 1993, and Congress legalized funding for fetal tissue research that year.\n\nIs human fetal tissue really necessary for medical research?\n\nKyle Orwig, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and molecular genetics and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thinks \"human fetal tissue research is necessary.\" Although many questions can be answered with cells in a Petri dish, \"there is no way that stem cell technologies, organoid cultures or other techniques can model the complex and dynamic events\" that occur during human fetal development.\n\n\"Other animal models, stem cells, organoids and other cutting edge technologies can provide important insights that reduce (but not eliminate) the requirement for human fetal tissues in research,\" said Orwig, who spoke generally and did not address the possible National Institutes of Health contract dispute with UCSF.\n\nWithout fetal tissue research, \"scientists would be working in a vacuum subject to overinterpretation of data generated in a Petri dish,\" he said, adding that this would have \"dangerous implications\" for human medicine.\n\nPatricia Morris, a board member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and a professor in the Reproductive Health Program at Rockefeller University, said human fetal tissue -- specifically that derived from elective abortions -- is \"absolutely essential.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute today,\" said Morris, who also did not comment on the contract with UCSF. \"No reproducible, robust and clinically relevant materials are otherwise available.\" She added that the \"materials obtained from spontaneous abortions\" are not only \"highly variable\" but often contain \"critical gene defects.\"\n\nA similar balancing of ethical and moral questions occurred during the decades of debate about research using stem cells derived from human embryos.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2001, President George W.

saying such exams needed to be of sufficiently high quality to be held in the same esteem as A-levels and academic qualifications.\n\n\"It needs a system which is very high quality, is well invested in, is well accepted - and not everybody passes,\" he said.\n\nHe warned of a \"plethora of mediocre\" qualifications that not well understood by either the public or employers but said, he wanted to remove \"false barriers\" between academic and vocational qualifications and that both could be routes into higher education.\n\nOn the Sutton Trust report, Mr Hinds said: \"Whilst potential and talent is evenly spread, the opportunities to make the most of it sometimes aren't.\n\n\"Recent data shows progress has been made for disadvantaged students going to university, there is still a long way to go.\n\n\"I want universities to work with us, consider the data carefully and look at their own admissions policies to work out what can be done to ensure that their university is open to everyone who has the potential, no matter their background or where they are from.\"\n\nTim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of leading universities, said: \"We want to recruit students with potential and drive, regardless of background, and we are working hard to improve social mobility.\n\n\"There has been progress in recent years but today's research underlines that this remains a big challenge.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "O2 4G data network restored after day-long outage", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46464730", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:20", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nMobile operator O2 has said its data networks have been restored after a day of disruption for smartphone users.\n\nA statement on its website, published early on Friday, said the 4G network was working again, having been affected from about 05:30 GMT on Thursday.\n\nIt said the slower 3G data service had been reinstated on Thursday evening.\n\nEarlier O2 and mobile network equipment supplier Ericsson issued a joint apology to the millions of customers hit by disruption to its data services.\n\nO2 has 25 million users and also provides services for the Sky, Tesco, Giffgaff and Lycamobile networks, which have another seven million users.\n\nServices such as bus timetable information were also been affected, while many businesses faced disruption.\n\n'Poor experience'\n\nEricsson UK boss Marielle Lindgren said the \"faulty software\" that had caused the issues was being decommissioned.\n\nIn a joint statement, O2 boss Mark Evans said: \"I want to let our customers know how sorry I am for the impact our network data issue has had on them, and reassure them that our teams, together with Ericsson, are doing everything we can.\n\n\"We fully appreciate it's been a poor experience and we are really sorry.\"\n\nEricsson said there had been network disruption for customers in multiple countries.\n\nKnock-on effects\n\nEarlier, Ericsson president B\u00f6rje Ekholm gave more detail about the cause of the disruption.\n\nHe said \"an initial root cause analysis\" had indicated that the \"main issue was an expired certificate in the software versions installed with these customers\".\n\nThe company was carrying out \"a complete and comprehensive root cause analysis\", he added.\n\nJapan's Softbank network was also affected by the outages, which meant services on Y!Mobile were disrupted.\n\nO2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the UK's second-largest mobile network after EE, which is part of BT.\n\nThe company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either.\n\nThe outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working.\n\nTom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts.\n\n\"As well as the inconvenience to consumers and the associated frustration, having a major network out of action creates productivity challenges for businesses.\n\n\"Many businesses will have employees commuting or out in the field that have lost work time,\" he said.\n\nCut-off customers\n\nImage caption O2 customers Mischa Bittar, Omeran Amirat and Luke Stagg have all suffered disruption\n\nOn Thursday, several O2 customers described the effects the outage was having.\n\nAllison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and was unable to get to a landline.\n\n\"I'm disabled ...

They've gone now.\"\n\nHe said he had lost the bids and \"O2 are responsible\".\n\nCan I claim compensation?\n\nCustomers of O2 will be able to claim for any out-of-pocket expenses that resulted from being without their phone, according to consumer expert Helen Dewdney.\n\nMs Dewdney, who writes a blog called The Complaining Cow, said users should be able to claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states that services should be carried out with reasonable skill and care.\n\nThat means customers would be able to claim a refund for what they would pay on a contract for the time they were without the use of the phone. They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone.\n\nThis must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle.\n\nMs Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\n\nIf they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member. The customer would need to ask for a deadlock letter or wait eight weeks from the beginning of the complaint."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Huawei arrest: Justin Trudeau denies political motivation", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46471904", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:22", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government had no involvement in the arrest of a top executive from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was detained at Vancouver airport on a US extradition request.\n\nChina has demanded her release, calling the arrest a human rights violation.\n\nThe charges have not been made public.

They could also claim consequential loss due to breach of contract, for example, if they incurred bank charges because they were unable to move their money, or the cost of having to use a payphone.\n\nThis must be a genuine loss which can be proved with evidence. So, a taxi driver might be able to prove they lost out on fares owing to the shutdown, but other workers trying to claim a lost day of employment would struggle.\n\nMs Dewdney suggested phone users calculated their losses, and wrote to O2 with the evidence. They should state what they wanted as redress and mention the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\n\nIf they felt the response was unsatisfactory, it could be referred to Ombudsman Services: Communications of which O2 is a member.

I lost my voice,\" she said.\n\nShe said she had experienced other patients being aggressive and swearing at her, with one even stalking her.\n\nBut she also complained about her treatment at the hands of staff.\n\n\"I was restrained face down on a mattress. One nurse even told me I should kill myself,\" she said.\n\n\"When I tried to object or complain, I was not listened to. There was good care too - I remember once being taken go-karting. But my experiences left me anxious and suicidal.\"\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nMrs King formed part of the working group put together to review the way the Mental Health Act worked.\n\nIt included mental health professionals, academics and patients.\n\nThe 18-month review recommended a number of changes, including:\n\nnew rights for patients to legally challenge their treatment\n\nmore frequent opportunities to challenge detention\n\nlegally binding advanced care plans so patients could express how they wanted to be treated if they were sectioned\n\na requirement for doctors to record when and why they chose to ignore patient requests\n\nan end to police cells being used as a place of safety and less frequent use of police cars to transport patients\n\nthe right to choose a \"nominated person\" to have control of a patient's care if they were sectioned - at the moment it automatically goes to their nearest relative\n\nProfessor Sir Simon Wessely, who chaired the review, said it was time to bring the act up to date.\n\n\"It was written when people with a mental health problem were something to be afraid of. But the way we think about mental health and illness has changed dramatically, so now they are more likely to be seen as people to be helped.\n\n\"The act needs to help them more - to make it easier for people to express their choices and preferences about how they want to be treated and harder for them to be ignored.\"\n\nHe added black and ethnic minorities along with people with learning disabilities and autism appeared to be particularly ill-served by the act as they had higher rates of detention.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Simon said BME groups had higher rates of mental illness \"probably because of early experiences of discrimination and exclusion\".\n\nHe also said it was important to note that such groups were more likely to be perceived as a risk.\n\nHow many patients does this affect?\n\nThe act deals with patients who are detained in hospital. Every year about 1.8 million patients receive mental health treatment - but only one in 20 of these is treated in hospital.\n\nAbout half of those are admitted voluntarily, with nearly 50,000 detained against their will for their own protection or the protection of others.\n\nThe numbers being detained have been rising - up by 40% in the past 10 years.\n\nSir Simon said there is no one reason for the increase but added that it is partly down to society becoming more \"risk averse\" but also because there are fewer alternatives to detention.\n\nThe rise in population will account for a small proportion of the rise but beyond that there is concern the act may be being misused.\n\nThere have been reports of dementia patients being detained, while black and ethnic minority patients are much more likely to be sectioned.\n\nAs well as reducing the number of detentions, the review group wants to see a reduction in the use of compulsory treatment orders whereby patients are released from hospital under supervision.\n\nThey say public safety will not be put at risk.\n\nBut they acknowledge the changes will require greater investment in community services, particularly crisis care to stop people deteriorating to such an extent that they need hospital treatment.\n\nThe recommendations relate to England and Wales only. The review team said Scotland had already started making some of these changes, while Northern Ireland has agreed to review its own laws.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nMental health charities are overwhelmingly supportive of the recommendations.\n\nMind chief executive Paul Farmer said the legislation was outdated, with thousands of people every year having to endure \"poor treatment\".\n\nMark Winstanley, of Rethink Mental Illness, said the charity had \"long campaigned\" for reform of the act.\n\n\"Countless people have told us how they felt disrespected and lost all control of their care while treated under the act,\" he said.\n\nAnd even doctors acknowledged change was needed. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Prof Wendy Burn said detention was clearly \"incredibly stressful\" for patients and there needed to be a focus on improving their experiences.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the review would be used to make changes to the legislation.\n\n\"The disparity in our mental health services is one of the burning injustices this country faces that we must put right,\" she said.\n\n\"For decades, it has somehow been accepted that if you have a mental illness you will not receive the same access to treatment as if you have a physical ailment. Well, that is not acceptable.\"\n\nRead more from Nick\n\nFollow Nick on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "St George's Hospital: CQC report reveals details of heart unit feud", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46460314", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption NHS Improvement is overseeing the actions taken by the hospital (library image)\n\nFeuding surgeons at a troubled cardiac unit worked in a culture of hostility, tribalism and mistrust, inspectors say.\n\nComplex heart operations were moved out of London's St George's Hospital in September after a leaked document revealed a \"toxic\" row had contributed to an above average death rate.\n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) said mediation worked only briefly, with \"poor behaviour\" soon returning.\n\nThe trust said its cardiac surgery was safe and improvements had been made.\n\nWhen CQC inspectors visited over three days in August and September, they found top physicians with \"strong\" personalities unable to work together effectively.\n\nAccording to their subsequent report \"consultant surgeons mistrusted each other, as well as cardiologists, anaesthetists and senior leaders.\"\n\nThere was a culture of \"tribalism\", one consultant said, and staff told inspectors the cardiac surgical team \"had not worked effectively for several years\".\n\nInspectors wrote: \"Consultants did not work collaboratively, share responsibility or resolve conflict in a constructive and timely manner.\n\n\"Staff did not work together to ensure delivery of high-quality, safe and effective services that put patients at the centre.\"\n\nCQC's chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Ted Baker said: \"Issues such as weak leadership, internal unrest and multiple electronic patient record systems are just some of the problems affecting St George's Hospital cardiac surgery unit.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images/Dan Kitwood Image caption Complex heart operations have been moved out of the cardiac surgery unit since September to allow \"improvements to be made\"\n\nThe leaked report in the summer, by former NHS England deputy medical director Mike Bewick, found the unit, in Tooting, had a cardiac surgery death rate of 3.7% - above the national average of 2%.\n\nIt said the team was consumed by a \"dark force\" and patients were put at risk.\n\nThe latest data shows mortality rates at the hospital, which carries out about 1,000 cardiac operations a year, have improved, with the cardiac surgery death rate reduced to 2.7%.\n\nThe trust has been ordered to make a series of improvements, including a call to address cultural problems within the service and to resolve issues over leadership.\n\n'Significant challenges'\n\nIn September, it was announced all complex heart operations would temporarily be moved to other hospitals, although routine cardiac surgery would remain at the unit.\n\nManagers said the move, which affected about 100 patients, would \"give us space to make improvements.\"\n\nResponding to the CQC report, Jacqueline Totterdell, chief executive of St George's, said: \"The service experienced significant challenges earlier this year, and it will be reassuring to the communities we serve that the CQC has confirmed it is safe.\n\n\"Of course, this does not change the fact that significant improvements are required - and significant progress has been made since the CQC's visit back in August.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Woman's Botox party warning after lip filler swelling", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-46434480", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Rachael Knappier Image caption Rachael Knappier did not leave her house for more than a week after her lips swelled dramatically as a result of lip filler being \"incorrectly administered\"\n\nA woman's lips swelled up so much they touched her nose after she had filler injected at a Botox party.\n\nRachael Knappier, from Leicestershire, said she \"shouted out in pain\" after she was given the treatment by a beautician at her friend's house.\n\nShe rushed to A&E when her lips swelled dramatically, later seeking private treatment to fix the problem.\n\nThe 29-year-old warned others against having lip fillers from someone not medically trained.\n\nAfter agreeing to Botox on her forehead, Miss Knappier said the beautician noticed a lump on her lip - an injury she sustained when a fire door hit her at the age of 13.\n\n\"That lump is my number one insecurity.

So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?\n\n\"Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,\" said Prof Stott.\n\n\"If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.\"\n\n\"But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.\"\n\nA number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate.

It had lost the scales characteristic of its ancestors.\n\nThe ichthyosaur's outer layer is still somewhat flexible and retains evidence of the animal's camouflage pattern.\n\nThe reptile was counter-shaded - darker on the upper side and light on the underside. This counter-balances the shading effects of natural light, making the animal more difficult to see.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurs are interesting because they have many traits in common with dolphins, but are not at all closely related to those sea-dwelling mammals,\" said co-author Mary Schweitzer, professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University (NCSU).\n\nTheir similar appearance suggests that ichthyosaurs and whales evolved similar strategies to adapt to marine life - an example of convergent evolution.\n\nProf Schweitzer said: \"They have many features in common with living marine reptiles like sea turtles, but we know from the fossil record that they gave live birth, which is associated with warm-bloodedness.\"\n\nMost reptiles today are cold-blooded, meaning their body temperature is determined by the warmth of their surroundings. Blubber helps some marine animals maintain a high body temperature regardless of the ocean water temperature.\n\nCo-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden, told BBC News: \"Blubber is found in living marine mammals but notably also adult individuals of the leatherback sea turtle. Its primary role in all of these animals seems to be insulation, and the leatherback is unique in many aspects.\n\nImage copyright Johan Lindgren / Martin Jarenmark Image caption Comparisons between artificially matured modern porpoise blubber and skin and the equivalent from a fossil ichthyosaur.\n\n\"It has metabolic rates that are higher than are those of typical reptiles, and a suite of measures for heat retention and control, and collectively these enable adult leatherbacks to venture into cold water environments.\n\n\"So, ichthyosaurs were able to control their body temperature at least as well as leatherbacks, but then it is hard to say if they were fully endothermic (warm-blooded) or not.\"\n\nThe researchers identified the blubber and skin remains on a well-preserved ichthyosaur specimen held by the Urweltmuseum Hauff in Germany. It was discovered in Holzmaden quarry, in the country's south-west, which has produced many other well-preserved fossils from the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe fossil was subjected to an exhaustive analysis of its microscopic structure and molecular composition.\n\n\"Both the body outline and remnants of internal organs are clearly visible,\" said co-author Johan Lindgren, from Lund University in Sweden.\n\n\"Remarkably, the fossil is so well-preserved that it is possible to observe individual cellular layers within its skin.\"\n\nThe researchers identified cell-like microstructures which probably held pigment, and an internal organ thought to be the animal's liver.\n\nThe blubber-like material contained fragments of fatty acid molecules.\n\n\"This is the first direct, chemical evidence for warm-bloodedness in an ichthyosaur, because blubber is a feature of warm-blooded animals,\" said Prof Schweitzer.\n\nTo provide additional support for this idea, the researchers artificially matured the blubber of a modern porpoise, exposing it to high temperatures and pressures - as it would be during the process of fossilisation.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Artwork: The fossil belongs to a type of ichthyosaur called Stenopterygius\n\nThe resulting \"matured\" porpoise blubber shared many features with the fossilised version.\n\nAs for the ichthyosaur's skin, the camouflage pattern would have provided protection from Jurassic predators such as flying pterosaurs, attacking from above, and pliosaurs (even bigger marine reptiles), which would have attacked from below.\n\nDr Lindgren said: \"Given the density of pigment cells, and the fact that they occur in both the epidermis and dermis, we hypothesise that ichthyosaurs had a really dark dorsal (upper) skin, which is also what you see in many extant whales that are deep divers (as ichthyosaurs) and venture into cold, arctic regions (as did ichthyosaurs).\n\n\"A melanic (dark) colouration would benefit ichthyosaurs as a UV protection while at the sea surface, but could perhaps also help ichthyosaurs thermoregulate as is the case in the leatherback sea turtle.\"\n\nLosing the scales and evolving smooth skin would also have helped ichthyosaurs manoeuvre more easily underwater.\n\nJohan Lindgren said the still-flexible skin meant the specimen must have been fossilised so fast that organic molecules were trapped inside the mineral component of the fossil.\n\n\"Soft tissues, such as skin, have hitherto been considered to be so labile (easily broken down) that the only way they can survive is via full replacement by minerals. However, as it turns out, when these minerals are removed, some of the original organics remain,\" Dr Lindgren explained.\n\nThe results are published in the journal Nature.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Cars and coal help drive 'strong' CO2 rise in 2018", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46447459", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The main factor in the rise is coal use in China\n\nA booming global market for cars has helped drive CO2 emissions to an all-time high in 2018, say researchers.\n\nThe main factor in the near 3% rise has been coal use in China, driven by government efforts to boost a flagging economy.\n\nBut emissions from cars, truck and planes using fossil fuels continue to rise in all parts of the world\n\nRenewables have also grown this year, but are not keeping pace with the CO2 rise.\n\nThe research, carried out by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), says that this year's \"strong\" rise is projected to be 2.7%.\n\nThat's much bigger than 2017's 1.6%. This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before.\n\nSo what's caused the rise?\n\nWhile coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%.\n\nAt UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity.\n\n\"For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,\" she said.\n\nOther factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy.\n\nWho are the biggest emitters?\n\n2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada.\n\nA booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%.

In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%.\n\n\"Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world.\"\n\nAccording to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries.\n\nWhat does this year's rise in CO2 mean?\n\nImage copyright Robert Alexander Image caption Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough\n\nIt's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nPeople are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed.\n\n\"Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,\" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis.\n\n\"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015.\"\n\nHow are people at COP24 reacting to the rise?\n\nIt is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress.\n\n\"All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,\" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid.\n\n\"The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n\n\"If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?\"\n\nIs anything being done to limit emissions from cars and trucks?\n\nDespite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine.\n\nWhile they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally.\n\nNorway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025.

Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas.\n\nMore than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years.

The name is a reference to the Lunar Excursion Module that put the Apollo astronauts on the Moon.\n\nThe BEM has been built using a lot of off-the-shelf components, but has been tested in a pressure chamber to ensure it can handle the crushing forces at depth.\n\nImage copyright Team Tao Image caption The BEM will ultimately be deployed in swarms to map larger areas\n\nThe robot is programmed to rise and fall through the water column, tracing a line across the seabed and using its sonar to record its shape. It carries a camera to photograph things it sees, and can be fitted with sensors to record seawater conditions.\n\nOnce the BEM's mapping cycle is complete, the robot returns to the surface where it is scooped up by the USV and brought back to shore.\n\nTeam Tao will have several days of testing off Kalamata before entering the competition zone, possibly around the 13th or 14th of the month.\n\nFugro, the big international geophysical survey company, and a partner on the XPRIZE competition, has already made a baseline map of a 500 sq km area at the bottom of the Mediterranean.

And Team Tao's leader, Dale Wakeham, concedes his group's concept is not quite at the stage of maturity it would have ideally liked.\n\n\"Winning at the grand prize final for us is about proving the capabilities of our system,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"We have a lot of firsts, and what we want to show is that for the map we do create - we can do it at a price point that is an order of magnitude lower than what traditional equipment can achieve. Within another six months, we expect to be able to scale up. Ultimately, our 20ft vessel will be able to deploy and recover four BEMs at a time.\"\n\nLess than 20% of the global ocean floor has been mapped to a meaningful level of precision.

TeamTao, and the other competitors in the XPRIZE, are trying to break this price bottleneck.\n\nThe ocean community - scientific and industrial - has set itself a target to map the entire ocean floor to an acceptable standard by 2030. That will require higher investment, but likely also quite a few of the new approaches being demonstrated in the XPRIZE competition.\n\n\"The concept we have put forward is of 'cubesats for the ocean',\" said Dale Wakeham. \"We're using this competition to show people what the future of subsea surveying looks like.\n\n\"This is a start point for us.

Today, the occupied West Bank is home to two-and-a-half million Palestinians; it's an integral part of their homeland.\n\nThere are constant hostility and frequent violence between settlers and Palestinians.\n\nThou Shalt Not Kill follows Israel's Hilltop Youth, a hardline, religious, nationalist settlers' organisation that sets up illegal outposts across the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn the following account, filmmaker Fatima Lianes provides a personal insight into the making of her film and the issues behind it.\n\nBefore embarking on this film, I had last visited Israel in 2007. I hadn't known it then, but that trip would be the key to making Thou Shalt Not Kill, 11 years later.\n\nWhen I first met Itamar more than a decade ago, he had just resigned from the Israeli army after years of leading military operations in the occupied territories.\n\nHe had told me that, as a child, he'd never imagined he could kill someone, let alone have the desire to kill them. But, as a soldier, he had killed - and that tore him up. So much so that he'd contemplated committing suicide.\n\nHe recalled a particular night when he'd entered a Palestinian village to arrest an \"alleged terrorist\" and the man's son had stared at him intensely. He knew that look too well. It was a look of hatred - the same hatred Itamar, whose grandparents had all been killed in the Holocaust, had felt as a child towards Nazis.\n\nHe realised then that \"if that Palestinian child looked at me as I looked at a Nazi, there is something that does not work, something has to change\".\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nFrom that moment, Itamar changed his life and dedicated himself to working for peace. Forgiveness - particularly learning to forgive himself - helped him to heal his wounds. Forgiveness, he taught me, is the only thing that can win over revenge.\n\nSo, when more than a decade later, I learned that I was going to make a documentary about youth and radicalism, the first person I called was Itamar.\n\nBut the call did not go as I expected. Itamar had stopped believing in peace. Things in Israel had grown worse and peace was now an unattainable utopia, he told me.\n\nThe photo of Hussein Dawabshe\n\nA few days before I was due to leave for Israel, I received a telephone call that would change my life. My mother had had a medical emergency. I postponed my trip.\n\nDuring long hours spent waiting in the hospital, between laughter, tears and family confessions, I came across a picture of Palestinian Hussein Dawabshe.\n\nHussein had lost his daughter, son-in-law and 18-month-old grandson in 2015, when a group of radical Jewish settlers known as the Hilltop Youth had firebombed their home in the occupied West Bank. The only survivor was Dawabshe's four-year-old grandson, Ahmed, who had burns to more than half of his body.\n\nThe picture of Hussein had been taken at the entrance to the court where a hearing for the accused was due to take place. Young radicals surrounded him, singing about his deceased grandson: \"Where is Ali? Ali is burned, Ali is on the grill.\"\n\nHussein's expression conveyed immense pain and frustration, but also a certain calm.\n\nI suddenly knew the story I had to tell, and everything took a 360-degree turn - in my life as well as in my plans for the film.\n\nMy mother died.\n\nSo I found myself heading to Israel during a moment in my life when I was at my most fragile. But being close to death can give us a different perspective on life and instead of destroying me, my mother's death gave me a certain strength: the empathy to feel the pain of a Palestinian grandfather and the determination to give him a voice.\n\nEntering the world of the Hilltop Youth\n\nWhen I landed in Tel Aviv, entering the world of the Hilltop Youth seemed almost impossible. The group is reclusive and although our fixer had tried contacting them, they refused to talk.\n\nOur first insight into their world came through the Goldberg family, devoted followers of the late radical rabbi, Meir Kahane, and associates of the defendants in the arson attack.\n\nWithout an appointment, we travelled to their home in Tapuach, a Jewish settlement in the Judea and Samaria region. As expected, we weren't welcome. But we decided to wait in front of their house. After a few hours, during which several people entered and left the house casting suspicious looks our way, 20-year-old Rut Goldberg allowed us to enter her home.\n\nThe hall was filled with pictures of Kahane and the American-Israeli Baruch Goldstein. Ruth looked at them with pride, while telling me how Goldstein, who was responsible for the 1994 Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, in which 29 Muslims were killed, gave his life \"for his people\".\n\nGradually, more members of Rut's family arrived - her father Lenny and her sisters - and we began to immerse ourselves into their lives.\n\nGaining their trust was a slow process that took several days, many conversations and moments of great internal struggle.\n\nMy intention was never to judge them but to listen and understand, which is difficult when a young woman is speaking proudly about the death of an 18-month-old Arab baby while affectionately hugging her two-year-old niece.\n\nI felt angry. Sometimes I thought I was going to explode with anger. But I also felt compassion and even a certain sorrow for Rut. She was just a girl who had never had the opportunity to know a different reality. Her father proudly said that he made sure to give her \"the best Jewish values\".\n\nMy intention was never to judge them but to listen and understand, which is difficult when a young woman is speaking proudly about the death of an 18-month-old Arab baby while affectionately hugging her two-year-old niece. Fatima Lianes, filmmaker\n\n'Youths lost to a lie'\n\nOur goal of finding the Hilltop Youth continued throughout this. Every day, for hours, we went around the hills of the occupied West Bank, looking for ways to talk to them. But nobody wanted to cooperate. Some of them took photos and videos in order to denounce us on social networks.\n\nWe always returned to our hotel bereft of hope.\n\nThen, one day, when we were about to give up, we read on social media that the Hilltop Youth were due to begin the reconstruction of an outpost demolished two weeks earlier by the Israeli army.\n\nWe decided to look for the outpost and, after hours of searching, finally spotted a small structure with a flag on it. We got out of the car and began, tentatively, to approach it.\n\nMy primary feeling was fear. If these people were able to burn a Palestinian family, what would they do to us?\n\nIt was an inhospitable, hostile place, and the Hilltop Youth hid in their little house. Our fixer approached them first and, gradually, we got closer. The flag read \"God is the King\".\n\nI expected to find \"monsters\" but they were just shy children who hardly ever stopped praying and constantly recited the Torah. I felt the same way for them that I had for Rut: compassion and grief for the youths they'd lost to a lie.\n\nRevenge was the protagonist in their lives.\n\nSlowly, these kids who devoted their lives to \"conquering the hills\", started opening up - sharing their thoughts with us. We listened.\n\nI expected to find 'monsters' but they were just shy children who hardly ever stopped praying and constantly recited the Torah. I felt the same way for them that I had for Rut: compassion and grief for the youths they'd lost to a lie. Fatima Lianes, filmmaker\n\nThe power of forgiveness: Meeting Hussein\n\nThroughout this, I could see Hussein Dawabshe's expression in that photo, but I hadn't yet felt ready to meet him. He would be the last person I met on my trip.\n\nAfter days spent with those who celebrated his tragedy, I didn't want to be carried away by my emotions when I did finally meet him.\n\nWhen that time came, Ahmed, Hussein's grandson and the only survivor of the attack on his family, was playing in his grandfather's house. He was the only one able to draw a trace of a smile on his grandfather's face.\n\nAhmed's room was full of pictures of him with his deceased mother and I could not help but cry. I had been lucky to enjoy a mother for 41 years of my life, but Ahmed would not.\n\nWe walked together to the house where his family was murdered. Hussein had decided to leave it intact so that no one would ever forget what had happened there. I struggle to find the words to express the feelings that overtook my body upon seeing it. Emptiness? Anger? None of them does it justice.\n\nHussein walked calmly around the house in silence and, again, the power of forgiveness appeared in my life.\n\nHow does a man who has lost everything have the dignity to get up every day, to stay alive - struggling but determined that his grandson would grow up not with the idea of revenge but of forgiveness?\n\nAfter everything, and in spite of its harshness, filming Thou Shalt Not Kill has been a haven of peace and hope for me, helping me feel gratitude for my upbringing, for my family and, especially, for my mother, for the values that she taught me, for the tolerance and respect.\n\nPeople say that forgiveness is capable of healing even the deepest wounds and this trip to Israel reminded me of this by healing mine too."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

It is critically important that the government adopts world best practice in the management of the species to ensure the species doesn't slide into extinction,\" Woehler said.\n\nThree recently hatched orange-bellied parrots in the wild were also recently killed by the same bacteria, the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment confirmed."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New study predicts major Southern California beaches erosion by 2100", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136169057.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Exposed bedrock on the beach during very low (negative) tide at Isla Vista, California.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Blames Russia Probe for Weak Poll Ratings", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-blames-russia-probe-for-weak-poll-ratings/4689999.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:25", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump is now blaming the Russia probe for his historically weak poll ratings.

Fresh figures released this week showed that emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide jumped the highest in seven years, making the task of cutting those emissions one day to zero even more challenging.\n\nNegotiators at the climate talks in Katowice, Poland, still disagree on the way forward but have just a few days to finish their technical talks before ministers take over.\n\n\"It's going to be a big challenge,\" said Amjad Abdulla, the chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. \"We are going to forward the sticky issues to next week.\"\n\nAmong the splits that need to be overcome before the conference ends on Dec. 14 are:\n\n* The question of what kind of flexibility developing countries will have when it comes to reporting their emissions and efforts to curb them.\n\nThe issue is central to the Paris rulebook, which countries have committed to finalizing this year. Environmental activists insist that countries such as Brazil, with its vast Amazon rainforest, and China, the world's biggest polluter, should have to provide hard data on emissions and not be treated like poorer nations who don't have the ability to do a precise greenhouse tally.\n\nComplicating matters, a group of rich countries that includes the United States and Australia is seeking similar leeway as developing nations.\n\n* Several oil-exporting countries have objected to the idea of explicitly mentioning ways in which global warming can be kept at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body made up of scientists from around the world, recently proposed \"policy pathways\" that would achieve this goal, which foresee phasing out almost all use of coal, oil and gas by 2050.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia and some of its allies say it would be wrong to cite those pathways in a text about future ambitions.\n\n* Developing countries are frustrated that rich nations won't commit themselves to providing greater assurances on financial support for poor nations facing hefty costs to fight the effects of climate change. European governments argue that they are bound by budget rules that limit their ability to allocate money more than a few years in advance.\n\nWhat's clear is that few countries are moving in the right direction to halt global warming.\n\n\"The first data for this year point to a strong rise in the global CO2 emissions, almost all countries are contributing to this rise,\" said Corinne Le Quere, who led the team that published the emissions study this week.\n\n\"In China, it's boosted by economic stimulation in construction. In the U.S., an unusual year, cold winter and hot summer, both boosting the energy demand. In Europe, the emissions are down but less than they used to be, and that's because of growing emissions in transport that are offsetting benefits elsewhere,\" she told the meeting in Katowice.\n\nLe Quere, the director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in England, noted some positive news.\n\n\"We have renewable energy,\" she said. \"It is displacing coal in the U.S. and in Europe, and it is expanding elsewhere.\n\n\"It's not enough to meet the growing energy demand in developing countries in particular,\" she said. \"But the industry is growing.\"\n\nHost nation Poland, which depends on coal for 80 percent of its energy needs, is among those demanding help for workers in coal and gas industries who could lose their jobs as nations shift to cleaner energy.\n\nIn light of the deep divisions over how to best fight climate change, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is considering returning to Katowice to push for a strong declaration.\n\n\"It very much remains a possibility,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Thursday. \"If he feels his presence will be useful, he will go back.

I think we\u2019ve come out of the era of being the blind man with the stick,\u201d said Robert Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\n\u201cWe can survey much more efficiently, and, not only that, but in much greater detail,\u201d he said, adding that the work was painstaking. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s a big place!\u201d he said.\n\nThe advent of new technology, such as underwater drones and robots, is also speeding up the mapping process.\n\nA global competition hosted by energy giant Shell, the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, is also under way, offering $7 million to teams that can develop technologies to conduct ocean exploration autonomously, rapidly and to a high resolution.\n\nA team from Seabed 2030 has reached the final stages of the competition with an idea based on remotely operated robots working in extreme depths to map territory independently.\n\nEconomic benefits\n\nExploring Earth\u2019s final frontier will do more than satisfy scientific curiosity, it should bring economic benefits, too.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the world\u2019s trade is carried by sea, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a U.N. body, making safe navigation a key motivator for mapping.\n\n\u201cIf a ship runs aground it\u2019s a terrible day for the economy, it\u2019s a terrible day for the environment and it\u2019s a bad day for the captain, too,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nSeabed 2030\u2019s map would have other benefits, experts said: In a warming world, it would provide a better idea of sea levels as ice melts and, importantly, warn about impending tsunamis that could devastate coastal communities.\n\nThey said it would also help the so-called \u201cblue economy\u201d as countries and companies seek to protect or exploit deep-sea resources, from exploring for oil and gas to installing wind farms or laying fiber-optic cables for the internet.\n\nThat is predicted to become more important in the coming years, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It expects the ocean economy to contribute $3 trillion to the world economy by 2030, up from $1.5 trillion in 2010.\n\nPolitical rifts\n\nSome parts of the oceans \u2014 the East Coast of the United States, areas around Japan, New Zealand and Ireland \u2014 are relatively well-mapped, experts said. Others, including the West African coast or that off the Caribbean, remain largely blank.\n\nThe introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), an international treaty, allowed countries to determine their continental shelves and exclusive economic zones, legitimate territorial claims off their coasts.\n\nIt also spurred a rush to map and claim land, Larter said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest land grab in recent history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Julian Barbiere of UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, it would be a \u201cparadox\u201d if, after collaboration at a scientific and technical level to share data, countries used that knowledge against each other in geopolitical spats.\n\n\u201cThere are already tensions in some parts of the world, and one of the reasons for that is access to resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSome countries, he added, are reluctant to give up strategic proprietary data to the Seabed 2030 project, largely because of national security concerns or in areas with sensitive geopolitical tensions, such as the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cThere is already a lot of data, which is sitting there but it\u2019s not being released. We hope to change attitudes and to really get countries to contribute,\u201d Barbiere said.\n\nThe next phase of the project, he said, is to encourage data donors and crowdsourcing, not just from exploration vessels but from cargo ships, recreational sea-users and fishing boats.\n\n\u201c(It) goes back to this principle: the ocean is an international space by definition ... part of the common heritage of mankind,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking ahead, in a bid to meet the U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 14 \u2014 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans \u2014 mapping will take center stage during negotiations to be completed by 2020, as nations create a new, legally binding treaty to protect the high seas.\n\n\u201cThere are so many benefits to knowing more about the ocean floor,\u201d Hasebe said. \u201cHumanity as a whole would be able to benefit.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Australian Bid for Encrypted Data Passes First Hurdle", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-bid-for-encrypted-data-passes-first-hurdle/4688991.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "The Australian parliament\u2019s lower house Thursday passed a bill to force tech firms such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook and Apple to give police access to encrypted data, pushing it closer to becoming a precedent-setting law.\n\nHowever, the proposal, staunchly opposed by the tech giants because Australia is seen as a test case as other nations explore similar rules, faces a sterner test in the upper house Senate, where privacy and information security concerns are sticking points.\n\nThe bill provides for fines of up to A$10 million ($7.3 million) for institutions and prison terms for individuals for failing to hand over data linked to suspected illegal activities.\n\nLabor party concerns\n\nEarlier in the week it appeared set to secure enough support from both major political parties, with some amendments, to secure passage.

Yet while the country is scheduled to depart on March 29, 2019, Britain is as divided over the issue as it ever has been.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has agreed the terms of the \u2018divorce\u2019 with the leaders of the EU\u2019s remaining member states, but lawmakers in the British parliament still have to approve the so-called Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nIn ordinary times, a Conservative government with a simple majority would be able to get the deal through the House of Commons with little fuss.\n\nBut these are extraordinary times. May cannot rely on the support from members of parliament in her own party \u2013 much less Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has been propping up May\u2019s minority government since her disastrous general election last year.\n\nPress Association Will Theresa May quit? Could Jeremy Corbyn become Prime Minister?\n\nAs it stands, as May bizarrely takes her Brexit plan around the country as if on the election trail, no commentator in the country expects the prime minister to get enough support when MPs vote on December 11. The only question, it seems, is how heavily she is defeated.\n\nThen what? That\u2019s where things get more unpredictable, with the outcomes ranging wildly from the prospect of another general election to no Brexit at all.\n\nHere\u2019s your guide to what will be a historic week in British politics, however it ends.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now?\n\nOn Tuesday, MPs began five days of debates ahead of what is described as the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on May\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement they are debating outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. The vote is expected on December 11, but even that isn\u2019t set in stone. Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.\n\nWill May get enough votes?\n\nProbably not.\n\nSome 20 Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against May\u2019s deal, 45 have said they will not vote in favour and more than 20 have said they are unhappy with it. Their unease comes from, as they see it, the agreement aligning the UK too closely with the EU, and they claim May is set to deliver a Brexit in name only.\n\nGiven that May doesn\u2019t have a majority in parliament, she will be relying on support from opposition parties. May\u2019s minority government ally, the DUP, who usually vote with the government to help them pass legislation, has also expressed its own concerns with how the deal risks separating the island of Ireland from the mainland as a trading territory.\n\nThe Labour Party, the official opposition, has also declined to approve May\u2019s Brexit deal, saying the have concerns about the impact on jobs and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe bottom line is this: the chance of the deal being approved with the simple majority of 320 of the 639 MPs eligible to vote is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat are the amendments?\n\nThe vote - or votes - may not be limited to the terms of May\u2019s deal. Labour has tabled an amendment outlining how MPs will \u201cpursue every option\u201d that prevents the UK leaving the EU on the terms of May\u2019s deal or leaving without any deal at all.\n\nTory and Labour backbenchers have also put forward something similar, and there appears to be united front against the UK quitting the EU without any deal - or what is colloquially referred to as \u2018crashing out\u2019.\n\nIndeed, on the first day of debates, MPs voted for a motion that means if May\u2019s Brexit is voted down next week, MPs can effectively instruct ministers on what to do next and amend her \u201cplan B\u201d option.\n\nPress Association\n\nWhat happens if she wins the vote?\n\nIn the unlikely event that scores of MPs from across the political spectrum swing behind the embattled prime minister, it will allow the government to introduce the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill to the Commons either before Christmas or after recess (the holiday for parliament), in January.\n\nWhile no guarantee of the legislation passing, it would suggest an orderly procession towards the EU exit doors.\n\nWhat happens if she loses the vote?\n\nYou would expect Theresa May\u2019s premiership to be over, right? While that\u2019s a likely outcome, it is not the only one. These are the most likely scenarios.\n\n\u2013 She could try again\n\nThis would depend on the margin of her defeat.\n\nThe European Union has been adamant this is a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 deal that cannot be renegotiated. But if faced with the threat of a calamitous no-deal Brexit and following a narrow Commons defeat, May might fancy testing their resolve and seeing if she can get at least some cosmetic changes to appease enough MPs to win a second vote.\n\n\u2013 Theresa May quits\n\nMay herself has been adamant that she will stay on as prime minister regardless of the result. But a defeat by something in the order of 200 votes - which would represent a rebellion by scores of her own MPs - and it could be the most elegant way out.\n\n\u2013 May forced out by a Conservative rebellion\n\nConservative MPs most strongly opposed to May\u2019s deal have already failed to oust May, struggling to muster enough support to trigger a leadership battle two weeks ago. But once the vote is over, other disgruntled Tory politicians could make their move.\n\n\u2013 Second referendum\n\nYes, taking the deal to the public is an option. May has ruled it out, and Labour has backed the idea - but only if they do not get a general election. It would possibly require an extension to the two-year timeframe to agree a Brexit deal, but even a senior Conservative has suggested another referendum could logistically be held by the end of May (the month, that is).\n\n\u2013 May calls another general election\n\nThe \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 pass. The Prime Minister could hope that voters will - via the ballot box - back her plan. Her fellow Conservatives are anxious to avoid this route after the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament and a resurgent Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u2013 Labour tries to force an election"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Luxembourg Announces Plan To Become First Country To Make All Public Transportation Free", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luxembourg-public-transportation_us_5c08d6ace4b069028dc685ac", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "In an effort to reduce traffic congestion and the environmental impact of cars, Luxembourg has announced its plan to become the first country in the world to make all its public transportation free.\n\nThe European country\u2019s recently re-elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has promised to lift fares on trains, trams and buses nationwide by summer 2019, The Guardian reported.\n\nAs the paper noted, however, some of the finer points of the plan have yet to be ironed out, including whether trains will still have first and second class compartments and if so, if riders will be charged in those cases.\n\nTraffic congestion is a major problem in Luxembourg, which receives approximately 170,000 cross-border commuters from neighboring France, Belgium and Germany on a daily basis.

Davis\u2019 recent Lena Dunham profile in The Cut, which focused heavily on the \u201cGirls\u201d creator\u2019s chronic health issues, Dunham told the writer at one point that she\u2019d \u201clike to be the face of\u201d the fibromyalgia drug Lyrica. This comment, among others, left me wondering: Is Dunham capable of being part of a collective movement without trying to be its face?\n\nI don\u2019t think she can. And the fact that she\u2019s trying to be is a problem.\n\nDespite multiple public mishaps over the past several years caused by her own lack of awareness, Dunham continues to demand center stage \u2015 in her own work, in her mother\u2019s photography series on gender, in the #TimesUp movement, and now among the disabled and chronically ill. It\u2019s because of Dunham\u2019s privilege that she\u2019s able to do this. Privilege of any kind (racial, economic, gender) is not inherently bad, but it comes with the responsibility to amplify the voices of marginalized folks.\n\nLena Dunham, in her refusal to do this and instead be the voice herself, is hurting the very causes she claims to support. When she accused Aurora Perrineau, a Black biracial woman, of fabricating a rape allegation against one of Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d colleagues in 2017, she made it clear she doesn\u2019t understand both the weight of her voice and the very movement she claims to ardently support. The same can be said for her eagerness to write the script for a film about Syrian refugee Doaa Al-Zamel rather than insisting the team hire a Syrian writer.\n\nThese are just two items on Davis\u2019 \u201clist of things Dunham has been asked to apologize for\u201d but has ultimately failed to learn from. Her recent guest editor\u2019s letter in The Hollywood Reporter is another example of the media\u2019s willingness to allow Dunham to fail up, giving her a platform to excuse her dismissal of Perrineau as a learning experience. I\u2019m hesitant to believe that her time silent on the issue was spent in introspection; if it had been, she may have had the foresight to realize the \u201cWomen in Entertainment\u201d issue of The Hollywood Reporter was not supposed to be a public forum for her own redemption. These actions and subsequent hollow apologies prove Dunham can\u2019t be the one to represent the chronically ill and/or disabled \u2015 especially the most marginalized of us, a group she repeatedly fails to uplift.\n\nRather than center Dunham\u2019s narrow experience battling chronic illness as a wealthy white woman, we should pass the mic to people with diverse experiences.\n\nI\u2019m a Lebanese-American Muslim woman with endometriosis and mental illnesses. I haven\u2019t experienced poverty, but my family has always struggled financially and continues to do so now. I understand the frustration and difficulties that come with finding good care as a woman of color with illnesses often considered \u201cinvisible\u201d or even fake.\n\nThe intersections of poverty, race, class and gender with illness and disability are complex. To properly navigate these issues, it\u2019s crucial we seek out those who have lived in their crossroads. Rather than center Dunham\u2019s narrow experience battling chronic illness as a wealthy white woman, we should pass the mic to people with diverse experiences. And though our Twitter feeds should hardly be where our engagement ends, it\u2019s a good place to become familiar with intersectional issues in the disability and chronic illness communities.\n\nDisabled Black women like Vilissa Thompson, Keah Brown and Imani Barbarin highlight the scarcity of disabled people of color in the media, the lack of diverse voices within the disability community, and the particular challenges Black disabled women face. (Check out #DisabilityTooWhite, #DisabledAndCute and #HealthcareWhileColored to see their influence in action.) And research substantiates these women\u2019s experiences. Black people, and particularly Black women, are not receiving equal health care to their white counterparts. By and large, doctors ignore Black women\u2019s pain and spend less time with Black patients, both of which can cause medical trauma and frustration when seeking help for chronic illnesses or disabilities. Through Thompson, Brown and Barbarin, we learn about the experiences unique to Black disabled women. Amplifying their voices encourages more diverse, inclusive and representative discourse from which everyone benefits.\n\nThe health care battle in the U.S. may seem like just another policy debate to Lena Dunham and other wealthy Americans, but its implications are outrageously costly for middle class and poor chronically ill people. Azmia Magane and Porochista Khakpour both write about living with chronic illnesses and how being sick is far from cheap \u2015 it\u2019s actually criminally, immorally expensive. The road to diagnosis for so-called \u201cinvisible\u201d illnesses like lupus, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, endometriosis and others is a painstakingly difficult and long process, and running multiple tests and visiting several specialists takes an economic and emotional toll. I\u2019ll let you guess how many doctors told me that my excruciating cramps were just \u201cpart of being a woman\u201d before I was eventually diagnosed with endometriosis.\n\nIs Dunham capable of being part of a collective movement without trying to be its face?\n\nIn sharing their experiences, Magane and Khakpour also highlight an issue that an overwhelming number of Americans face: Around 79 million of us struggle to pay our medical bills and have accumulated medical debt. A diagnosis can bring relief and validation, but it also brings a slew of medical bills to fund treatments, trips, hospital stays and prescriptions. I\u2019ve personally had to pick and choose which doctor I can afford to see in a given month. Money shouldn\u2019t be a barrier in accessing quality health care \u2015 and for Lena Dunham, it isn\u2019t. Patients like Dunham, who can afford health care and have adequate insurance, should be using their privilege to advocate for universal health care and increase visibility of medical debt and its effects.\n\nEven activism itself is often inaccessible for many who wish to advocate for themselves. To combat this, Aditi Juneja, a lawyer and writer, used her experience as a woman with a disability to create the Resistance Manual, an intersectional and accessible tool that aims to help English speakers educate themselves on American policy issues, organize around them and take action. But most Americans who regularly protest the Trump administration\u2019s injustices don\u2019t consider the lack of accessibility in activist spaces \u2015 including public marches. Mia Ives-Rublee is a disabled woman of color and the founder and coordinator for the Women\u2019s March on Washington Disability Caucus. In the early days of the Women\u2019s March, the movement centered around white women, and even when women of color took the helm, disability rights were absent from its platform. Ives-Rublee worked with the march\u2019s co-chairs to ensure the movement included these rights.\n\nSocial justice movements, if they wish to be accessible to all, should include and engage with disabled people from the point of inception. Disability can intersect with any and all identities, and disability rights should be considered integral in any activist space. If she truly wanted to be an advocate, Lena Dunham could use her fame and access to request meetings with leaders of these types of events and demand accessibility for the movement\u2019s chronically ill and disabled members.\n\nI am not among the most marginalized, nor can I possibly include every person\u2019s unique experience. I am non-disabled, cisgender, have good insurance (with high co-pays), somewhere to live, food to eat and a great support system. My experiences are considered standard in a system not created to serve everyone. Trans and non-binary people, undocumented folks and indigenous people all have unique and important experiences with chronic illness and disability that also need amplification. What I and many others ask of Lena Dunham is simple: Own your privilege and use it to amplify those whose voices are so often pushed out into the margins, where this system wants them to stay."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "America's Health Care Spending Keeps Rising Really Slowly.

That will be a surprise to most people who actually use the American health care system.\n\nLast year, the rate of growth in the total amount of money U.S. residents, businesses and governments spent on health care was just 3.9 percent, the lowest since it was 3 percent in 2013. America spent $3.5 trillion on health care in 2017, according to a report by the independent Office of the Actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that appeared in the journal Health Affairs on Thursday.\n\nHealth care spending grew more slowly than the economy last year, too, for the first time since 2013, when economic growth also outpaced expenditures on health care. Because of this, the share of the entire economy devoted to health care was 17.9 percent, slightly less than in 2016.\n\nFor decades before the late 2000s, health care became an increasingly large portion of the gross domestic product, a trend that many saw as inexorable. Rising health care spending threatened the stability and sustainability of government health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It also resulted in a de facto decrease in household income as employers \u2015 which are the biggest source of health coverage \u2015 allocated more and more money to health benefits and less and less to wages.\n\nSo the good news is that the health care spending problem has been correcting itself, in a way. The data from last year shows that the major funders of health care \u2015 federal and state governments and employers \u2015 all enjoyed the benefits of slower spending growth.\n\nThe bad news is that patients don\u2019t seem to be seeing whatever advantages this brings. Health insurance premiums continue to rise, especially for those who don\u2019t get coverage from employers and must buy it themselves, either from a health insurance exchange or directly from an insurance provider. Prescription drugs make up a fairly small portion of total health care spending, but prices have continued to rise over the years. And with more and more people enrolled in health insurance policies with deductibles in the thousands of dollars a year, patients who have coverage are paying more of the costs for their medicines and treatments than before.\n\nSo the good news is that the health care spending problem has been correcting itself, in a way. ... The bad news is that patients don\u2019t seem to be seeing whatever advantages this brings.\n\nThe tide on overall spending began to turn during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 and the years of sluggish recovery that followed, when spending growth slowed. There was nothing unusual about this. Health care spending tends to dip when more people are unemployed and uninsured, and those who remain employed either have less money to devote to health care or are more cautious with their spending when they fear they, too, might become jobless. It also was predictable that the rate of growth in health care spending continued to be lower than in decades past in the first few years after the recessions.\n\nThe enactment of the Affordable Care Act occurred during this period, specifically in March 2010. In the years that followed, that law used federal money to expand health coverage through subsidized private health insurance and expanded Medicaid eligibility. That new money being pumped into the system increased the rate of growth, as expected. But the law also included cost-containment provisions, especially significant reductions in how much Medicare pays for hospital care and other medical services, that provided a counter-effect.\n\nIn fact, the United States is spending more than $2 trillion less on health care than predicted before the Affordable Care Act became law.\n\nExperts then and now never arrived at a consensus for why double-digit annual percentage increases in national health care spending abated. Everyone agrees that economic downturns and slow recoveries led to less growth in health care spending.\n\nWhat still isn\u2019t clear is why that trend continued amid the largest increase in health coverage since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 coupled with an improving economy and a plummeting unemployment rate.\n\nThe rate of growth in health care spending ticked back up in 2014 and 2015 as federal dollars flowed out to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This followed several years of historically low increases in spending.\n\nBut the trend reversed itself in 2016 and continued last year, with the rate of increase dropping back down to less than 5 percent, where it had been in the late 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nThe actuaries attribute their 2017 findings to many factors, including things like smaller increases in prescription drug prices, mainly related to brand-name drugs facing new generic competition and to fewer extraordinarily high-priced medicines coming to market. The report also notes a decrease in prescriptions for painkillers, which coincides with a nationwide effort to curb the opioid addiction epidemic."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Infant Ibuprofen Recalled At CVS, Walmart, Family Dollar", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/infant-ibuprofen-recall-cvs-walmart-family-dollar_us_5c0937c9e4b0bf813ef4d7eb", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "A pharmaceutical company is voluntarily recalling some brands of infant ibuprofen for possibly containing higher concentrations of ibuprofen.\n\nTris Pharma on Wednesday issued the voluntary recall of the medication, sold in 0.5 oz. bottles as \u201cConcentrated Oral Suspension, USP (NSAID), 50 mg per 1.25 mL.\u201d\n\nCVS, Walmart and Family Dollar stores sold the product under their store brands (CVS Health, Equate and Family Wellness, respectively).

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported.

If confirmed, Ms. Nauert would be one of the most prominent promoters of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.\n\nMs. Nauert had been the favorite after Ms. Haley announced that she would leave the job, but after The Wall Street Journal reported that she was expected to be given the role, Mr. Trump grew muted about the choice, and administration officials said that she had become less interested in the post.\n\nThe president floated other names to associates as possible nominees, including Kelly Craft, the ambassador to Canada; Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany; and John James, a Republican who lost a Senate race last month in Michigan.

Mr. Trump\u2019s growing focus on him comes amid a rocky reception for Matthew G. Whitaker, whom the president installed last month as acting attorney general after ousting Jeff Sessions from the post.\n\nWith Democrats vowing oversight hearings into Mr. Whitaker when they take over the House in January, the president is said to be under pressure \u2014 including from allies like Republican senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the departing and incoming chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 to quickly nominate a viable successor to Mr. Sessions.\n\nMr. Barr is seen as the leading candidate for the nomination if Mr. Trump does not decide to stay with Mr. Whitaker for an extended period, several Justice Department officials said this week.

While people who are born with both copies of CCR\u2085 disabled are resistant to H.I.V., they are more susceptible to West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis. And there are simpler and safer ways to prevent H.I.V. infection.\n\nMore worrying, Crispr often inadvertently alters genes other than the one being targeted, and there are also circumstances, called mosaicism, where some cells contain the edited gene and others do not. Dr. He claimed in a video that Crispr did not affect other genes in the twins and that the babies were \u201cborn normally and healthy,\u201d but there is no way to know if that is true.\n\nIn fact, some of the data Dr. He presented at a conference in Hong Kong, after he announced the birth of the twins, is concerning, several scientists said. For one thing, it indicates that he was able to disable both copies of the CCR\u2085 gene in only one of the twins, whom Dr. He identified as \u201cNana.\u201d In the other twin, \u201cLulu,\u201d only one copy of CCR\u2085 was disabled, providing limited, if any, protection against H.I.V., but Dr. He implanted the embryo anyway.

(But those plans aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway.\n\nPeople are signing up for Medicaid instead\n\nThe state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state\u2019s recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that.\n\nOther states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law.\n\nMore people have jobs\n\nAs the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it\u2019s probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage.\n\nFor some people, the plans are less affordable\n\nPrices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price.\n\nLast year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid th emselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage.\n\nThis year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places \u2014 and people may not be able to find a free plan this year."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Drug Maker Pays $360 Million to Settle Investigation Into Charity Kickbacks", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/actelion-johnson-and-johnson-kickback-medicare.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "In 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said, Actelion raised the price of its main drug, Tracleer, by nearly 30 times the rate of inflation.

It admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Johnson & Johnson was not implicated in the allegations since the activity under scrutiny took place before Actelion was acquired.\n\nDrug companies often help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs through coupons or other financial assistance. These payments are not just about benevolence \u2014 they also help blunt the outrage over rising drug prices by limiting how much patients have to pay. Insurers then cover most of the cost.\n\nBut federal anti-kickback laws prohibit companies from giving such financial assistance to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries because doing so is considered an inducement to buy their drugs. For years, drug makers have skirted those laws by instead donating to nonprofit charities, which then give the money to Medicare patients. Such arrangements are legal as long as there is no direct coordination between the pharmaceutical company and the nonprofit organization.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Actelion violated the law by collecting detailed data in 2014 and 2015 about the patients receiving help from a nonprofit, the Caring Voice Coalition, and using the data to budget for future donations. As a result, Actelion ensured that the money it donated would be used only to assist patients who used its drugs, and not competing companies\u2019 treatments for the pulmonary condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "From a Deceased Woman\u2019s Transplanted Uterus, a Live Birth", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/health/uterus-transplant-birth.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-07 09:01:51", "body_paragraphs": "A woman who received a uterus transplanted from a deceased donor gave birth to a healthy child, researchers in Brazil said on Tuesday.
