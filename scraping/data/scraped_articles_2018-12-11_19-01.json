The deadline for funding is December 21.\n\nNo progress toward averting a shutdown appeared to be made following the meeting, which for a sizable part was broadcast live around the world and featured the President and the heads of the opposing party openly interrupting each other to question motives and dispute facts.\n\nAt one point, Trump appeared to sum up where this was heading: \"If we don't get what we want, one way or the other ... I will shut down the government.\"\n\nSchumer has urged Trump to either accept the Senate's bipartisan agreement to spend $1.6 billion to boost border security measures, or agree to a one-year spending resolution that would keep those funded at the current level of around $1.3 billion. Schumer said last week that money can be used for fencing and other features, rather than \"to construct any part of President Trump's 30-foot-tall concrete border wall.\"\n\nSparks fly\n\nThe sparks started to fly after Pelosi characterized the possibility of a partial shuttering of the federal government as a \"Trump shutdown,\" a term Schumer also used.\n\nTrump also claimed that he had the political momentum given that Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate, leading Schumer to take a jab.\n\n\"When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble,\" Schumer said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Schumer said he had not expected the reality TV atmosphere of the event and put the pressure to act on Trump.\n\n\"It's up to the President. We don't want it,\" Schumer said of the shutdown. \"We gave him a good plan not to shut down the government and it will be a Trump shutdown and then on January 3rd, if it happens, the House will open us up again.\"\n\nThe easiest solution for Congress to avoid a shutdown and get out of Washington before the Christmas holiday could be to avoid the issue altogether, and pass a short-term resolution to extend the rest of the federal government's spending into next year, when Democrats take over the House. But Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican Whip, said Monday he didn't expect Trump to agree to that.\n\n\"That really just postpones the pain, it doesn't really solve the problem,\" said Cornyn in advance of the meeting, explaining that Trump still wouldn't then get the wall funding he wants.\n\nTrump's Senate allies have mixed reaction to meeting\n\nSeveral GOP senators expressed concern about the prospects of a government shutdown after the meeting.\n\n\"We night come together, we might not,\" said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby. Asked about Trump's comment that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government, he said, \"I've never said that myself. I've always worked to fund the government.\"\n\n\"I'm really concerned about always a government shutdown,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.\n\nOthers believed Trump was goaded by Schumer into saying he would be proud to shut the government down.\n\n\"I think Sen. Schumer was very shrewd in his efforts to make sure whatever blame exists with the shutdown doesn't rest with the Democrats,\" said Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican who also said there should be some \"give and take\" in the talks including from Trump.\n\nBut some like his ally, Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, urged Trump to \"dig in.\"\n\n\"He needs to dig in and not give in,\" Graham said. \"I think what he is proud of is standing up to the status quo. People elected him expecting him to be different. We are talking about a small amount of money In a multi-trillion dollar budget.\"\n\nComplaining Pelosi will not accept a deal for addressing recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in exchange for wall money, Graham said: \"This liberal arrogance and I have had enough of it. Take it on, stare it down. See what happens.\"\n\nPolitical pressure over the wall\n\nDespite Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump has little leverage to force Congress into appropriating money for the border wall. While \"Build the Wall!\" was perhaps Trump's most indelible campaign promise, Republicans in Congress are broadly less enamored than he is with the prospect of building it and Democrats still control enough seats in the Senate to block it.\n\nFor months, Trump's frustration at Congress' response to his demand has spilled out into public. From July through September, Trump repeatedly said he'd be willing to shutdown the government over the wall, backtracked and then reiterated he would do it because he views it as a political boost. Few on Capitol Hill agree that Republicans would politically benefit should parts of the government shut down.\n\nDemocratic leaders and the President appear to be far apart on the issue even though warning signs of the spending showdown have been flashing for so long.\n\nLast week, Pelosi called the proposed wall \"immoral, ineffective and expensive,\" while Trump claimed that the country would save billions of dollars if Congress would pass a bill to build it.\n\n\"Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and will continue to update throughout the day on Tuesday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Schumer: Temper tantrum won't get Trump a wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nRE-d6Aihbk/schumer-trump-shutdown-border-wall-temper-tantrum-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "After a debate with President Trump in the Oval Office, Sen.

It covers crop insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- commonly referred to as food stamps -- as well as proposed changes to federal forest management policies.\n\nThe farm bill technically expired September 30, though major elements are funded through the end of the year.\n\nNegotiators recently came to an agreement on a final version after the House and Senate passed drastically different bills earlier this year. One of the major sticking points was the House bill's controversial addition of stricter work requirements for SNAP.\n\nThe new agreement, however, largely resembles the Senate version and excludes the stricter work requirements.\n\nViolence Against Women Act\n\nAlso high on the list is the Violence Against Women Act, which was set to expire on September 30. The bill has been extended through December 21, along with the must-pass spending bill to avoid the partial government shutdown.\n\nThe current law, enacted in 1994 and reauthorized ever since, addresses sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, primarily by providing grants and support to organizations and law enforcement programs that work with domestic violence victims and prevention.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans each introduced their own reauthorization bills this fall, but so far a final deal hasn't been reached. A Republican leadership aide said a lapse in funding for VAWA is not anticipated, but it's unclear whether a full five-year re-authorization with new legislation will happen in this Congress or the next.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who's the heavy favorite to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives , urged passage last week of a long-term re-authorization before the end of the year but said Democrats would take it up early next year if not.\n\n\"We'd like to do it this Congress, but if not we'll have to take it up at the beginning of next year,\" she said. \"But we'd rather do it (in) the Congress in which it was debated.\"\n\nDisaster relief funding\n\nThe same Republican leadership aide said the National Flood Insurance Program is also expected to see continued funding, even if it's unclear yet whether it will get a full re-authorization. The flood insurance program expired in 2017 but has been continued with multiple stopgaps ever since, and was most recently extended until December 21.\n\nThe program covers 5 million families in 22,000 communities. Lawmakers have been at odds over how to add investments and make reforms to the program to help mitigate flood costs. Regional divides also exist between those who want to see a smaller federal role in flood insurance and those who live in flood zones and coastal areas.\n\nAlong the lines of disaster relief, lawmakers are also trying to get emergency relief funding after devastating wildfires in California this year that cost dozens of lives and billions in damage.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Politico on Thursday she doesn't expect to get the $9 billion she requested for her state.\n\nFeinstein spokesman Tom Mentzer told CNN that the senator was referring to the fact that the $9 billion may not all come in the first round, but rather in several tranches as it has in the past.\n\n\"This isn't a problem now as there's sufficient disaster funds to pay for ongoing work,\" Mentzer said.\n\nSexual harassment legislation\n\nAlso on the docket for Congress -- though not necessarily must-pass items by the end of the year -- are key bills that remain in limbo as the clock ticks down. Sexual harassment reform in Congress is a high-profile item that was cleared in both chambers but through drastically different bills, and talks to merge the two bills together have stalled.\n\nRepublican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership and chairman of the Rules Committee, said \"we need to get this settled.\"\n\n\"There is a House bill and there is Senate bill,\" added the senator from Missouri. \"So, we're down to where we could settle this with one vote on each side of the building and put it on the President's desk and it would be a huge mistake, I think, to miss this opportunity.\"\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who's set to become the next House majority leader, told reporters last week he was \"hopeful\" Congress would pass a final bill before the end of the year.\n\n\"If we don't, it's going to be very early on in our agenda next year,\" he said.\n\nIf these issues do come for a vote this month, it's unclear if they'll get added to the must-pass spending bill or if they'll get their own separate votes.\n\nWhen GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee, was asked about adding the farm bill, the Violence Against Women Act re-authorization and sexual harassment legislation to the government spending package, he said ultimately it was up to the leadership to decide but he preferred not piling on complicated and politically tricky bills to the spending bills.\n\n\"We want to keep as many non-appropriations-type items off the bill, because it helped us move to where we are today,\" he said last week.\n\nOverhauling the US prison and sentencing laws\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, there's a heated debate going on over criminal justice reform among Republicans. The legislation at hand, known as the First Step Act, would allow some current and future prisoners to get out earlier, and rehabilitate into society through halfway houses, home confinement or other supervision, by reducing drug-related mandatory sentences and making more offenders eligible for early release.\n\nThe bill has backing from President Donald Trump and some major Republican donors but faces fierce opposition among some Republicans who say now is not the time to tackle criminal justice reform.\n\nGOP leaders in the Senate have repeatedly said they are assessing whether to take the bill to the floor but acknowledge their Republican caucus is deeply divided on the reforms and there is very little time left in the session to debate changes to the bill.\n\n\"The question is can you shoe horn something that's extremely controversial into the remaining time,\" Senate Majority Leaders Mitch McConnell said at an event last week. \"It's extremely divisive inside the Senate Republicans conference.\"\n\nAlso in the Senate is a long-running debate over a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, who's leading the Russia investigation. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term in January, has teamed up with Democrats to push for a vote on the bill, but those efforts have gone unsuccessful, as Senate GOP leaders have repeatedly said there's no need for such legislation."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi and journalists named Time Person of the Year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/upaFsoAAIeo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) Time magazine has chosen \"The Guardians,\" a group of journalists who have been targeted for their work, as Person of the Year.\n\nA series of four black-and-white covers highlights what the magazine calls \"the War on Truth.\"\n\nThe group includes Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post contributor who was killed at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October.

The top five warmest years have all occurred since 2014.\n\nTemperatures in the Arctic are warming more than twice as fast as the overall planet's average temperature, with temperatures this year in the highest latitudes (above 60 degrees north) coming in 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1981-2010 average. These were the second warmest (behind 2016) air temperatures ever recorded during the Arctic year, which runs from October through September to avoid splitting the winter season.\n\nThe five years since 2014 have been warmer than any other years in the historical record, which goes back to 1900. Although Arctic temperatures have been subject to wild swings back and forth through the decades due to natural variability, they have been consistently warmer than average since 2000 and at or near record since 2014, the report states.\n\n\"The changes we are witnessing in the Arctic are sufficiently rapid that they cannot be explained without considering our impacts on the chemistry of the atmosphere,\" Thomas Mote, a research scientist at the University of Georgia who authored part of the report, told CNN in an email.\n\nMote expressed than any natural cycle or mechanism that would lead to the amount of warming and ice loss that has been observed would take much longer than the few years over which we have seen these drastic changes.\n\nA vicious cycle\n\nSince 2000, Arctic temperatures, shown in red, have been higher than the overall global temperature anomalies, shown in gray. In 2018 the Arctic was shown to be warming at an alarming rate, twice as fast as the average global temperature.\n\nThe rapid warming of the Arctic is known as \"Arctic amplification,\" which is due to multiple feedback loops that the report describes. Warmer temperatures lead to less ice and snow, which means less sunlight is reflected and more is absorbed by the darker oceans. This warms the ocean further, which in turn decreases the sea ice even more. The lack of sea ice and more ocean surface leads to additional cloudiness later in the fall season, which keeps the Arctic region warmer even later into the winter.\n\n\"What starts in the Arctic isn't confined there,\" Mote noted. \"Changes in sea ice influence ocean currents and the jet stream in ways that can affect weather in lower latitudes, including the United States and Europe,\" Mote said.\n\nThe report highlighted several of these events over the past year as an example of how Arctic warming can influence day-to-day weather.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Bomb Cyclone' rips through East Coast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Bomb Cyclone' rips through East Coast 01:07\n\nSea ice continues to decline\n\nAs you would expect with the trend of record warm temperatures, sea ice has seen dramatic declines over the past 20 years as well, with 2018 continuing that trend.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Arctic Report Card, this year featured the second-lowest winter sea-ice extent -- the amount of the Arctic Ocean that is covered with sea ice -- since the satellite record began in 1979. The summer minimum sea ice was the sixth-lowest over the same time period.\n\nWhile winter sea ice extents have decreased at a much slower rate compared to the ice extent during the summer, there has been a significant change to the ice pack during the winter.\n\nOld ice -- ice that lasts through four or more melt seasons -- seen in 1985, left, and 2018, right.\n\nThe ice is much younger than it used to be . According to the report, fewer than 1% of Arctic ice is considered \"oldest ice,\" meaning it is at least four years old and has survived multiple melt seasons. Older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient to changes in temperature.\n\nSince scientists began measuring the age of the ice in the mid-1980s, multi-year ice in the Arctic has decreased in size from 2.54 million square kilometers (roughly the size of Mexico and all of Central America combined) to 0.13 million square kilometers (roughly the size of Nicaragua in Central America) -- a 95% reduction in a little over 30 years.\n\n\"Sea ice cover has transformed from a strong, thick pack in the 1980s to a more fragile, younger, thinner, and more mobile pack in recent years,\" the report states, where \"the thinner, younger ice is more vulnerable to melting out in the summer and has contributed to the decreasing trend in the minimum ice extent.\"\n\nRed tides and reindeer\n\nThe warming of the Arctic climate and the decline of sea ice have led to some drastic changes in the biodiversity of the region.\n\nThe report's authors found notable increases in harmful algal blooms, often known as red tides, which can affect human, wildlife and ecosystem health and lead to mass die-offs of fish and marine mammals, such as was observed in Florida during much of the summer this year.\n\nAs the Arctic warms, new toxins are being introduced to the region. This map highlights the location and kind of toxins found in marine animal species from 2004 to 2013 in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nWhile normally confined to warmer climates, the toxin-producing phytoplankton have been shifting northward as ocean temperatures rise, posing a risk to the local populations and economies that depend heavily on fishing for food and tourism.\n\nOther native wildlife species are feeling the heat, as well. Reindeer and caribou populations continued to decline in 2018, according to the report, with their total populations dropping by more than 50% over the past 20 years.\n\nWhile climate change isn't the only factor likely behind the decline in these herds, it is a driving force for a number of threats the animals face. Increased heat stress, food shortages, disease and parasites -- climate change overarches each of these challenges, the report states."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Climbers' bodies found 30 years after disappearance", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/GrjU_5EXjAQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Scottish mountaineer who spent weeks searching for two friends who disappeared in the Himalayas more than 30 years ago has spoken of his relief after their remains were finally found.\n\nThe bodies of Icelanders Kristinn Runarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson were discovered at the bottom of a glacier by an American climber last month, according to a report from the Church of Scotland.\n\nClimber Steve Aisthorpe, a Church official, was with the two men during an October 1988 expedition to climb Pumori, a challenging 7,161 meter (23,494 foot) mountain near Everest, and said the discovery had united those who knew the pair and had brought closure.\n\n\"The discovery of the remains of Thorsteinn and Kristinn after so many years has inevitably brought many emotions to the surface for all who knew and loved these wonderful guys,\" he said.\n\n\"But it has also brought people together and, I pray, will help with greater closure and, in time, peace.\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "An untold reason for the migrant caravan", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/oOg_ZqYhxqo/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Cop\u00e1n, Honduras (CNN) Each night after her husband left, Delmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez walked to a neighbor's house to look for him on the TV news. He had fled their mountaintop community here in rural Honduras without a phone because no one in the family could afford one. Their floor was made of dirt, they grew their own food. Watching coverage of the migrant caravan heading for the United States was Hern\u00e1ndez's only way to know if he was alive.\n\nWhat she saw in the broadcasts were visions from hell. Families jumping from bridges, getting kidnapped along dusty roads, dodging tear gas cannons fired by police from richer nations. How could this be? She continued scanning, hoping to find him, hoping not to.\n\nShe had begged Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez not to go, but her 30-year-old husband had his reasons. The town's corn and bean crops had failed during a years-long drought. There was no work aside from farming. No money for irrigation. Their four children, ages 3 to 13, had little to eat.\n\nRam\u00edrez told his wife that he had no choice but to leave with the \"caravan\" of thousands that had formed in Honduras and would make its way north. This was their chance, she recalled him saying that day. He could go with the group, find work, send back money.\n\nIt was this or risk starvation.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez with her four children.\n\nThe couple's tragic story, as well as others I heard on a recent four-day trip to western Honduras, complicates two narratives being told about the migrant caravan.\n\nTo hear President Trump tell it, Central American \"Gang Members and some very bad people\" are attempting to storm the United States at its southern border. \"This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you,\" the President wrote on Twitter. American news reports, meanwhile, largely have focused on high rates of violent crime in Honduras and El Salvador that have driven families to seek asylum as refugees in the United States.\n\nOverlooked is this factor: climate change.\n\nThe \"dry corridor\" of Central America, which includes parts of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, has been hit with an unusual drought for the last five years. Crops are failing. Starvation is lurking. More than two million people in the region are at risk for hunger, according to an August report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, without any change in rain patterns, people are already struggling,\" said Edwin Castellanos, dean of research at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and a global authority on climate change in Central America. \"In some of these dry areas, we have seen events of children actually dying out of hunger. So, it is that extreme.\"\n\nThis drought has been longer and more intense than those seen before in the dry corridor, Castellanos said. The failure of critical springtime rains is also new, he said, and is causing such problems for farmers whose crops depend on that water.\n\nSubsistence crops like corn and beans are all but dying. Our crew saw beans the size of Tic Tacs. And shriveled, partially blackened ears of corn could fit inside your palm.\n\nCorn crops have been smaller than usual, leading to a hunger crisis.\n\nKevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said in a speech on Friday that drought and crop failures in Honduras and Guatemala \"directly translate into who's arriving at our border.\"\n\nStudies have not definitively tied this particular drought to climate change, but computer models show droughts like the one happening now are becoming more common as the world warms.\n\nThousands have risked their lives to flee these circumstances.\n\nAnd previously unpublished data shows people started leaving certain areas of Honduras amid crop failures -- even as homicide rates were declining.\n\nTake Cop\u00e1n, the region of Honduras that Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez fled in October.\n\nIn fiscal year 2012, around the start of the drought, only about 20 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by the US Border Patrol while trying to cross the US-Mexico border, according to a data analysis of records shared with CNN by Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at The University of Texas at Austin. Then drought hit, its cumulative effects growing as the years wore on. In 2017, about 1,450 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by US authorities at the border, the data show. In fiscal year 2018, with the data ending in September, the number of migrants picked up was more than 2,500.\n\nThose figures are \"absolutely\" an underestimation, said Leutert. \"You're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to big cities, you're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to another place in the region, you're missing people who tried to go to the United States and didn't make it -- and you're missing people who went to the United States and crossed undetected.\"\n\nThe figure is a \"baseline\" that shows something big is happening, she said.\n\nAny person's decision to abandon their homeland is complex. For some, violence is part of it. As is extreme poverty. In Central America, it's often a combination of things.\n\nBut there's another truth: This region is becoming less hospitable to farmers as more-industrialized countries burn loads of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. A December report shows the world is on track to create 37.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2018 -- yet another record. This pollution traps heat and warms the planet, making cyclical weather events like droughts, floods and certain storms worse.\n\nThe United States, which is the destination for so many migrants fleeing Honduras, bears outsize responsibility for global warming. Cumulatively, the nation has done more to cause climate change since the Industrial Revolution than any other. Today, President Trump supports increased coal production and has pledged to abandon the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. A \"rulebook\" for that agreement is being debated this week at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, with the United States on the sidelines.\n\nNotably, Trump also has also made immigration his signature issues, rallying supporters around the idea of stopping people from Latin America, like Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, from crossing illegally into the United States. There's broad support for a crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States among Republican voters. A quarter of US midterm voters said that immigration was their No. 1 issue, and 75% of those voters were Republicans, according to a November exit poll. \"Build that wall\" has become a popular chant at Trump political rallies.\n\nFederal authorities have met would-be migrants at the border near San Diego with tear gas. Officials say the tear-gassing occurred after migrants threw rocks at authorities.\n\nYet there's an unspoken irony here.\n\nThe nation that's become a destination for so many migrants -- a beacon of opportunity and hope --is contributing to the conditions forcing some people to abandon home.\n\n'I was waiting for you like the rains in May'\n\nThink of Central America like an island.\n\nThat's advice from Castellanos, the climate scientist in Guatemala.\n\nHe's not talking about just any old island. He's referencing the specks of land in the Pacific -- Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands -- whose very existence is threatened by rising sea levels that are linked to global warming. I visited the Marshall Islands in 2015 after readers of CNN's \"Two Degrees\" series voted for me to do a story on \"climate refugees.\" Higher tides and increased flooding were already pushing people out -- and to Arkansas, of all places.\n\nCrops have been failing in the \"dry corridor\" of Central America.\n\nThese little islands gained a huge voice at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December of that year -- the predecessor to the talks happening now in Poland. Calling themselves the \"High Ambition Coalition,\" island diplomats rallied with richer nations to make a moral case for climate action -- saying their sovereign territory would vanish if global temperatures were allowed to warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. That goal became embedded in the Paris Agreement. In order to achieve it, global carbon emissions would need to be cut in half in about a decade.\n\nThe climate problem in Central America isn't so much sea-level rise. But Castellanos told me an argument can be made that the region is nearly as susceptible to global warming. It is a slim stretch of land connecting North and South America -- a string of land between continents. That makes it vulnerable to storms coming from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Climate change is supercharging those. Plus, climate models show both floods and droughts getting more intense. The United Nations Development Programme considers Honduras to be \"highly vulnerable\" to climate change, both now and in the future as the atmosphere continues to warm.\n\nThe dry corridor gets that name because it's long been dry, situated behind a mountain range that catches weather from the Caribbean. But the recent drought there has challenged notions about how bad a drought in Central America could be, Castellanos told me. Some areas have seen 10 consecutive months without rain.\n\nCentral Americans have an expression -- \"I was waiting for you like the rains in May.\" It references the fact that massive rains fall in May and June, like clockwork each year. Farmers plant their crops accordingly, counting on the spring rains to soak the plants and ensure a productive harvest. Many people here are subsistence farmers and can't afford irrigation systems. They're completely at the mercy of rains, and those rains aren't coming.\n\nWhen they do come, they come all at once -- causing floods and damage.\n\n\"Here, unlike in the United States, we don't have a problem of convincing people\" that climate change is real, Castellanos told me. \"People are convinced by what they see.\"\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, the farmer on the hilltop in Cop\u00e1n, lived through this. Then he heard the caravan was passing near his village. People believed that traveling together would provide safety. From Honduras to Guatemala to Mexico, the number would grow into the thousands.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ramirez left with the migrant \"caravan\" in October.\n\nIn mid-October, Ram\u00edrez fled Cop\u00e1n on foot, hoping to catch the caravan. He carried a small backpack with a few items of clothing, his wife said. In his pocket was a paper with a neighbor's telephone number on it.\n\nThat phone would ring in the village some time later.\n\nIt would not be Ram\u00edrez's voice on the phone.\n\nAnd the news would not be good.\n\n'We are losing most of the crops'\n\nI came to meet the people left behind.\n\nThe location: several communities in the Cop\u00e1n Department of Honduras, near the Guatemala border. I'd chosen the place because of the data CNN analyzed with Stephanie Leutert, from the University of Texas.\n\nThe data, which tracks families apprehended at the US-Mexico border, does not prove on its own that people are fleeing Cop\u00e1n because of climate change. But the figures do support the idea that people newly started fleeing during that timeframe.\n\nThe first point is that the exodus from Cop\u00e1n has grown faster than in the rest of Honduras. In 2012, only 3.7% of Honduran migrants came from that area. By 2018, up to September, it was more than 9%.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of murders per year in Cop\u00e1n has been declining.\n\nAgain, this provides only a rough sketch of what's happening, Leutert said, but it is clear that climate change is one factor driving people from the region. \"Climate change is reducing (crop) yields,\" she said. \"It's like a tax. It's making things harder for people and industries that rely on weather stability. Sometimes climate change can push people over the edge and make it impossible (to survive). We see that with the coffee industry. That last added cost is making the business model unsustainable -- and pushing people to migrate.\"\n\nCop\u00e1n is a mountainous place of dense forest and sweeping valleys. In the morning, mist rises from the hills like steam, making it look like molten ripples of land have just cooled. By afternoon, clouds hang on the hilltops, threatening to rain but rarely cracking. Dried-up corn stalks, which look almost unrecognizable if you're used to the engineered, Midwestern variety, dart around at odd angles between rocks and patches of dirt, clinging to steep hillsides. The more fertile land is the valleys, where most crops grow. Even during the worst of the drought, some vegetation here is green and appears almost lush. But Castellanos and others told me it's the timing and amount of rain that's critical. And many months here are now totally dry.\n\nWhat was it like to live in this place?\n\nAnd how and when did people feel it was impossible to stay?\n\nThe resident of this house in Copan, Honduras, emigrated. The area has seen its homicide rate go down while emigration to the US rises.\n\nOur team drove south past a town that was abandoned by the Mayan people thousands of years ago and now is known for the remaining artifacts. Our tires kicked up dust from the path, coating every roadside fern in a film of beige.\n\nAt a construction site, Evelio Ochoa, 35, was pouring cement into the land -- helping build the foundation of a home for his niece. He's doing any odd job he can find these days. Years ago, he told me, he paid a coyote -- a smuggler -- to help him leave Honduras. His small plot of corn and bean crops had failed, he said. The coyote's price: 60,000 Lempiras, or about $2,500. He got the money from a relative, he said.\n\nThat price bought him three attempts to reach the United States.\n\nHe made the first attempt in 2014, he told me, amid record drought.\n\nThe second was earlier this year.\n\nBoth times he was deported, he said.\n\nIf he failed a third time, there would be no money to try again.\n\n\"You don't fear for yourself, you fear for your family,\" Ochoa said of setting out on the journey. \"The moment you step out of the house and start walking it's difficult -- not because of the danger but because you miss your family\" and are thinking about their safety.\n\nIn September, Ochoa said, authorities caught him a third time.\n\nHe finds himself back in Honduras, struggling to feed his family.\n\nEvelio Ochoa said he fled to the United States three times unsuccessfully.\n\nOchoa's wife, Nora Vazques, said she and their five children would have starved if a relative hadn't been sending money from the United States. The 33-year-old mother, whose children are ages 1 to 12, showed me a basket of unusable black corn kernels, picked from a rotten crop.\n\n\"Before, the rain was much better,\" she said standing in the shadow of her doorway, the midday light half-illuminating her face. Her hand shook as she wiped away tears.\n\n\"He grew a lot of corn\" back then, she said. \"Now we are losing most of the crops.\"\n\n'This is an injustice'\n\nLisandro Mauricio Arias is mayor of the town the Mayans abandoned.\n\nWe met at the town square, which is surrounded by tile roofs and palm trees. Cop\u00e1n Ruinas is a tourist destination that boasts several quaint hotels, but the town has seen better times. For that reason, I figured Arias might downplay the outmigration that data shows is occurring here -- that he might have an incentive to say the drought hasn't been so bad.\n\nHe didn't do that.\n\nThe town is emptying out, he told me.\n\nHow many people have left?\n\nHis guess: 30%.\n\nHe regrets that, but says it may be the only way.\n\n\"When analyzing precipitation levels, we can see they have changed a lot -- which is really alarming,\" he said. \"Problems associated with drought will get worse.\"\n\n\"We respect the decisions the United States is making,\" he added. \"It's their country, and they have the right to defend it. However, I believe they need to take into consideration the human factor -- what is humanity? These people are not trying to meddle. [They are] looking for an opportunity to survive.\"\n\nAmong those people are the sons of Mariano and Gregoria Perez.\n\nThe two young men, ages 19 and 26, are stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, according to their family in Honduras. Their parents have only been able to speak with them two or three times, they said, because phone credit is so expensive. (I was unable to reach them.)\n\nTwo of Gregoria Perez's sons left Honduras in the migrant \"caravan.\"\n\nWhat the men's parents know are only the barest of details. One son was mugged and lost all of his belongings, including his passport, according to Mariano Perez, 55. Gregoria said she told the boys they could come back home. Secretly, though, the family worries. The young men have crossed international borders illegally already. Could they come back?\n\n\"I would say that this is an injustice because they did not do anything wrong,\" said Gregoria Perez, who, like her husband, said the boys left because farming wasn't viable amid the drought, and there were no other options. \"They want to find work to sustain themselves.\"\n\nI sat down outside to talk with her husband as the sun was setting. He sat on a small wooden stool and I was on the ground. The angle and time of night rendered his face in silhouette.\n\nMariano Perez told me his sons heard about the caravan on TV and left the same day. The father was down the hill helping a neighbor build a fence. He didn't know they'd left until he returned home that night. He doesn't fault them for it. He knew why they left, of course: drought.\n\nWhat bothers him is where they are now.\n\nHe worries they're hungry in Tijuana, as they were here.\n\nHe worries they may not make it across the border.\n\nSometimes, in his darker moments, he wonders if this is what God predicted in the book of Revelations -- the end of the world, happening slowly and before his eyes.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to find my news feed full of images of tent camps in Tijuana.\n\nIt had started raining on the migrants.\n\n\"I feel like a street dog,\" one man told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"Wet and cold and with no place to go.\"\n\nCorn crops, shown here, and beans are among the staple foods in the area.\n\n'Migration with dignity'\n\nI didn't say this to the lonesome father, but it's the reality: His sons have very little chance of settling lawfully in the United States if they are able to cross the border.\n\nThat's because there's no legal status for \"climate refugees.\"\n\nThe rules that govern the rights of refugees were developed in the aftermath of World War II and during the early Cold War, when western countries like the United States had an interest in protecting people who were persecuted in the communist Soviet Union, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier write in \"Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy for a Changing World.\"\n\nOnly a few specific groups were protected -- those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or social group. The 1951 UN refugee convention says people meeting those criteria should be able to seek asylum outside their home states.\n\nOther types of migration -- including people seeking economic opportunity or those fleeing climate change -- are not protected in a similarly codified way.\n\nThose people are typically not \"refugees\" in the legal sense.\n\nThey're migrants. And if they cross borders, they may break national laws.\n\nNot everyone believes that should be so.\n\nAnote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, one of the small island nations in the Pacific, has advocated for what he calls \"migration with dignity\" -- the opportunity for people from climate-affected areas to relocate if that makes their lives safer or gets them out of danger.\n\n\"There's no harm in being prepared,\" he told me in an interview this fall.\n\nCoffee producers are major employers in the region, and also have struggled.\n\nThat idea runs against the current of nationalism sweeping the globe. From the United States to Hungary, Australia to Denmark, countries have been fortifying walls, filling detention centers and even detaining asylum seekers on castaway islands -- not welcoming them. The United States is accepting far fewer refugees than it has in most years in recent memory.\n\nAttempting to add a \"climate refugee\" category in international law could pose problems of its own. Among them: How do you define who is and is not a climate refugee? Scientists are getting better at finding human fingerprints on heatwaves, droughts and storms that are being supercharged by global warming. But this is a realm of probabilities and complexities. It's difficult to say, with certainty, \"climate change made me move.\" Then there are political concerns, as well. Some scholars argue it's politically dangerous to try to amend international refugee conventions because this is such an anti-refugee moment in history. The process could lead to refugee rights being stripped instead of added. Others contend that the UN refugee convention is so rarely followed that it's almost irrelevant anyway, especially after the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe.\n\n\"If you were to create this whole new category and give people grounds to apply for asylum based on climate, you're likely to get an enormous number of people applying because it's so ill-defined,\" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \"How much below-average rainfall does the rainfall have to be in your region before you're a climate refugee? At present, the primary receiving countries already are experiencing tremendous resistance to the current level of asylees and refugees. It doesn't seem like resettling people in developed counties is going to be much of an answer to this problem. ... A much more effective use of resources is always to help people in place.\"\n\nIt's also unclear that climate change is the main reason people are fleeing Central America, he said; the \"pull factors\" of wealth and opportunity in the United States may be more important.\n\n\"You can think of climate change as one of the push factors,\" he said, \"but it isn't the reason we get the caravan, per se. And it's also important to understand if people were just starving, and they were desperately fleeing the total breakdown of the food chain, why travel 1,500 miles across Mexico to the US border? Mexico has lots of places you could stop to get basic sustenance.\"\n\nA 2018 report from the World Bank proposes two additional solutions.\n\nFirst, cut carbon emissions, which is the aim of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSecond, help would-be migrants adapt to the warmer world. The international Green Climate Fund, which President Trump promised to walk away from, too, has approved projects to help farmers in Central America to become more productive, blunting the force of drought. USAID also has supported irrigation and farming projects in the region, according to a federal official.\n\nDon't let the greenery fool you, scientists say. Western Honduras has been hit with a crop-damaging drought in recent years.\n\nCombined, those two tools could reduce forced, internal displacement from climate change by about 80%, according to the World Bank's \"Groundswell\" report on climate migration.\n\nBarring substantial changes, however, the scope of the migration crisis could be enormous.\n\nAn estimated 17 million people in Latin America could be forced to relocate within their countries because of climate change by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, according to the World Bank report. Across three regions that the World Bank examined -- which also included sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia -- more than 143 million people could be forced to relocate because of global warming.\n\nThat figure doesn't include extreme weather, such as hurricanes, which also are getting worse and tend to get more attention from the news media. The report only looks at slow onset climate disasters, from sea level rise to crop failures and water stress.\n\nIn other words -- events like the drought in Central America.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\n\nThe phone rang in the hilltop community.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez's husband, Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, had left several days before, looking for the caravan, carrying with him a phone number in his pocket in case he could find a way to call the village.\n\nShe'd been worried sick the entire time, scanning for his face on TV.\n\nThe voice did not bring relief.\n\nHer husband was missing, the person said.\n\nLater, she would learn the worst had happened.\n\nRam\u00edrez died on the road in Guatemala.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez buried her husband in the earth he used to till.\n\nThe precise circumstances are unclear to her. Perhaps he was hit by a car while walking along the highway. Perhaps he was hitching a ride in a car that crashed. These are the stories people have relayed. What she knows for sure is that he died October 20 near Guatemala City.\n\nCause of death: severe trauma.\n\nAuthorities were able to bring his body back to the village; she is thankful for that. She buried him on the slope of a mountain above the town, in the same earth he used to till.\n\nShe doesn't know what exactly will become of her family now.\n\nShe hasn't been farming, hasn't been able to.\n\nThe nonprofit World Vision has had to help with food.\n\nBut when she looks at her youngest child, she finds hope.\n\nHe is 3 years old -- and named Germ\u00e1n, like his father, and grandfather, too.\n\nWill he farm this same land? I asked her.\n\nYes, she told me.\n\n\"I imagine he will be just like his dad.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "How Huawei's CFO ended up in a jail in Canada", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/5E8LR87reR0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN Business) For months, American law enforcement officials wanted to arrest Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei, but she remained outside of their grasp.\n\nThen in late November, with just two days' notice, they spotted an opening.\n\nOn the morning of December 1, Meng was set to transfer from a Cathay Pacific flight at Vancouver International Airport. During her 12-hour layover there, she could be detained by Canadian police, giving US prosecutors the chance to seek her extradition.\n\n\"Unless Meng is provisionally arrested in Canada ... while in transit, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ensure her presence in the United States for prosecution,\" the US request to Canada for Meng's arrest said.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was taken into custody on December 1 \u2014 the same day that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping dined on steak in Buenos Aires and agreed to a truce in their trade war.\n\nThe detention of Meng, one of China's top tech executives, emerged days later. It has fueled doubts about whether the trade ceasefire will hold and added an unpredictable new element to the rocky relationship between the world's top two economies.\n\nThe United States has not shared details of its case against Meng and its efforts to get her to stand trial over allegations she helped Huawei dodge US sanctions on Iran. The US Justice Department has repeatedly declined to comment.\n\nBut a trove of documents filed in Canadian court and reviewed by CNN Business provides a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes moves that led to Meng's arrest.

She could receive substantial jail time if convicted, the statement said.\n\nHer arrest was set in motion in August, when a US federal judge signed off on a warrant for her arrest.\n\nThe United States accuses Meng, 46, of helping Huawei, one of the world's biggest makers of smartphones and networking equipment, get around sanctions on Iran. She's said to have told financial institutions that affiliate Skycom was a separate company in order to conduct business in the country, when in fact it was a subsidiary.\n\n\"Meng and other Huawei employees repeatedly lied about the nature of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom and the fact that Skycom operated as Huawei's Iran-based affiliate in order to continue to obtain banking services,\" the United States said in the arrest request it delivered to Canadian authorities.\n\na series of Reuters articles US officials went on to say that many of the deceptive statements followeda series of Reuters articles detailing Huawei's control of Skycom . The news agency reported that Skycom tried to illegally import US-made computer equipment into Iran.\n\nMeng is said to have made multiple false claims at a meeting with one of Huawei's banks in 2013. Though it's not named in court documents, Meng's lawyer said Friday the bank was HSBC ( HSBC ).\n\nThe United States claims that during the meeting, Meng used an English interpreter and walked through a PowerPoint presentation in Chinese that \"included numerous untrue or misleading representations regarding Huawei's ownership and control of Skycom.\"\n\nMeng said that Huawei's relationship with Skycom consisted of \"normal business cooperation,\" according to a translation of the presentation.\n\nHSBC is said to have cleared more than $100 million in Skycom transactions that traveled through the United States between 2010 and 2014.\n\nStuart Levey, chief legal officer of HSBC, said in a statement on Monday that the US Justice Department has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Standard Chartered ( SCBFF ) bank was also duped by Huawei . Standard Chartered spokeswoman Julie Gibson said Monday that the bank is \"unable to comment on client relationships or communications.\"\n\nMeng's attorney said in court that there's no evidence she had personal knowledge of the facts presented in the presentation, which was prepared by others.\n\nHuawei has said it's \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng\" and that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.\"\n\nFour children and two houses in Vancouver\n\nCourt documents also revealed more information about Meng herself.\n\nThe daughter of Huawei's elusive founder, Ren Zhengfei, Meng said she first started work at her father's company in 1993, according to the personal statement she submitted.\n\nShe married Xiaozong Liu, a venture capitalist, in 2007. They have a daughter. Meng also has three older sons from previous marriages.\n\nThough Meng primarily lives in Shenzhen, the city in southern China where Huawei is based, she said she was at one point a permanent resident of Canada.

The deadline for funding is December 21.\n\nNo progress toward averting a shutdown appeared to be made following the meeting, which for a sizable part was broadcast live around the world and featured the President and the heads of the opposing party openly interrupting each other to question motives and dispute facts.\n\nAt one point, Trump appeared to sum up where this was heading: \"If we don't get what we want, one way or the other ... I will shut down the government.\"\n\nSchumer has urged Trump to either accept the Senate's bipartisan agreement to spend $1.6 billion to boost border security measures, or agree to a one-year spending resolution that would keep those funded at the current level of around $1.3 billion. Schumer said last week that money can be used for fencing and other features, rather than \"to construct any part of President Trump's 30-foot-tall concrete border wall.\"\n\nSparks fly\n\nThe sparks started to fly after Pelosi characterized the possibility of a partial shuttering of the federal government as a \"Trump shutdown,\" a term Schumer also used.\n\nTrump also claimed that he had the political momentum given that Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate, leading Schumer to take a jab.\n\n\"When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble,\" Schumer said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Schumer said he had not expected the reality TV atmosphere of the event and put the pressure to act on Trump.\n\n\"It's up to the President. We don't want it,\" Schumer said of the shutdown. \"We gave him a good plan not to shut down the government and it will be a Trump shutdown and then on January 3rd, if it happens, the House will open us up again.\"\n\nThe easiest solution for Congress to avoid a shutdown and get out of Washington before the Christmas holiday could be to avoid the issue altogether, and pass a short-term resolution to extend the rest of the federal government's spending into next year, when Democrats take over the House. But Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican Whip, said Monday he didn't expect Trump to agree to that.\n\n\"That really just postpones the pain, it doesn't really solve the problem,\" said Cornyn in advance of the meeting, explaining that Trump still wouldn't then get the wall funding he wants.\n\nTrump's Senate allies have mixed reaction to meeting\n\nSeveral GOP senators expressed concern about the prospects of a government shutdown after the meeting.\n\n\"We night come together, we might not,\" said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby. Asked about Trump's comment that he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government, he said, \"I've never said that myself. I've always worked to fund the government.\"\n\n\"I'm really concerned about always a government shutdown,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.\n\nOthers believed Trump was goaded by Schumer into saying he would be proud to shut the government down.\n\n\"I think Sen. Schumer was very shrewd in his efforts to make sure whatever blame exists with the shutdown doesn't rest with the Democrats,\" said Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican who also said there should be some \"give and take\" in the talks including from Trump.\n\nBut some like his ally, Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, urged Trump to \"dig in.\"\n\n\"He needs to dig in and not give in,\" Graham said. \"I think what he is proud of is standing up to the status quo. People elected him expecting him to be different. We are talking about a small amount of money In a multi-trillion dollar budget.\"\n\nComplaining Pelosi will not accept a deal for addressing recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in exchange for wall money, Graham said: \"This liberal arrogance and I have had enough of it. Take it on, stare it down. See what happens.\"\n\nPolitical pressure over the wall\n\nDespite Republican control of the House and Senate, Trump has little leverage to force Congress into appropriating money for the border wall. While \"Build the Wall!\" was perhaps Trump's most indelible campaign promise, Republicans in Congress are broadly less enamored than he is with the prospect of building it and Democrats still control enough seats in the Senate to block it.\n\nFor months, Trump's frustration at Congress' response to his demand has spilled out into public. From July through September, Trump repeatedly said he'd be willing to shutdown the government over the wall, backtracked and then reiterated he would do it because he views it as a political boost. Few on Capitol Hill agree that Republicans would politically benefit should parts of the government shut down.\n\nDemocratic leaders and the President appear to be far apart on the issue even though warning signs of the spending showdown have been flashing for so long.\n\nLast week, Pelosi called the proposed wall \"immoral, ineffective and expensive,\" while Trump claimed that the country would save billions of dollars if Congress would pass a bill to build it.\n\n\"Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and will continue to update throughout the day on Tuesday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump spars with Schumer and Pelosi in Oval Office meeting", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nsorOQcrShQ/2ruXYvZ", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Aides never expected this meeting to go smoothly \u2014 they just didn't think the public would see it, CNN's Phil Mattingly explained moments after it aired.\n\n\"This was entirely predictable.

Click to subscribe!\n\n\"This ought to be a time when democracy leaps forward, an informed citizenry being essential to self-government. Instead, it's in retreat. Three decades after the Cold War defeat of a blunt and crude autocracy, a more clever brand takes nourishment from the murk that surrounds us. The old-school despot embraced censorship. The modern despot, finding that more difficult, foments mistrust of credible fact, thrives on the confusion loosed by social media and fashions the illusion of legitimacy from supplicants.\"\n\nThe Time cover never makes mention of President Donald Trump. Neither does Vick in that description of both the battle and its stakes. But the President looms over the choice as a silent presence -- a symbolic stand-in for the \"war on truth\" that Time sees its \"guardians\" fighting.\n\nIt's a fascinating choice, and one meant to send a message. Especially when you consider that whatever you may think of the concept of Time's person of the year (a small group of media elites making a decision about what's best among us etc., etc.), Donald Trump cares deeply about it.\n\nWhen Time picked German chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015, Trump tweeted this: \"I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany.\"\n\nWhen he was named Time's \"Person of the Year\" in 2016, Trump gushed : \"Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me 'Person of the Year' - a great honor!\"\n\nA year later, he was back to being upset for not being picked and making excuses : \"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named 'Man (Person) of the Year,' like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!\"\n\nTrump cares so much about the \"Person of the Year\" honor that a fake Time cover of him winning the 2009 award hung in at least five of his properties as of last year. \"Donald Trump: The 'Apprentice' is a television smash!\" read the headline on the cover.\n\nIn short: Time magazine's editors know that Trump watches their Person of the Year pick very closely. And so he knew he was a finalist -- the magazine announced 10 contenders on Monday -- and would have liked to have received the final rose. I know I am mixing reality TV metaphors, but you get the point\n\nBy not only spurning Trump for \"Person of the Year\" this year, but giving it to persecuted journalists the world over, Time is sending a very clear message: We stand on the side of truth and those who would defend it.\n\nTrump's record on truth is very clear: he's not a huge fan. According to The Washington Post's Fact Checker , Trump said more than 5,000 false or misleading things during his first 601 days in office -- a pace of more than eight a day, every day.\n\nHe has made the term \"fake news\" ubiquitous -- even if his description doesn't have to do with news that is actually untrue but rather with news he doesn't believe is positive enough for him. He has urged his supporters to reject all information that doesn't come directly from him. \"Stick with us,\" he told the VFW annual convention earlier this year . \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. ... What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\"\n\nIn choosing Khashoggi -- and other journalists risking their lives to do their jobs -- Time magazine is sending a very clear message to the President: The truth matters. The people fighting to bring the truth to light matter.\n\nThe CIA has reportedly concluded that Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi Arabia consulate in Turkey at the personal instruction of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has refused to accept that conclusion and, in a remarkable statement about the murder, said this: \"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\"\n\nRegardless, Trump added, the financial and geopolitical relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States was simply too valuable to risk over a single murder. \"We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe war on truth won't be won easily by the side arguing that facts can and still should exist. Misinformation -- particularly when it affirms a view you already hold -- travels faster and burrows deeper than a hard-to-hear truth.

Research shows that holiday weight gain is a major contributor to total yearly weight gain, so why not resolve to maintain your weight this holiday season? Here are 10 tips that may help.\n\nNever go to a party or dinner famished\n\nStart the day with a protein-rich breakfast -- eggs, a smoothie, Greek yogurt -- as this can help control your appetite throughout the day. In addition, have a healthy snack that includes protein, fiber and/or a little healthy fat -- fruit, nuts, turkey slices, yogurt, carrots and hummus or a protein bar -- before heading out the door so you don't make a dash for the cheese tray or bread basket the minute you arrive.\n\nPediatrician Dr. Tanya Altman gives her kids nut butter and sliced apples, cheese sticks, berries and yogurt prior to a party and advises that parents focus more on what kids should be eating rather than what they can't or shouldn't. Teach them what's important to eat for their brain and body: protein, fresh fruit and veggies, dairy, and then sweet treats in moderation are fine for a holiday dessert.\n\nDownsize your plate\n\nUsing larger plates at a buffet is associated with weighing more , and larger portions can increase calorie intake significantly -- and not just in adults. A study in children found that using larger plates significantly increased both the amount they served themselves and their calorie intake.\n\nPlate color seems to make a difference, too. A recent study also found that people ate 150 fewer calories when eating off white plates versus red or black plates.\n\nSurvey the buffet before filling your plate\n\nStudies show that people who survey a buffet before filling their plate tended to be trimmer. This is probably because they took the time to decide what they were going to indulge in rather than just loading up their plates as they went.\n\nWhen filling your plate, registered dietician Ashley Koff suggests using her Better Bites & Sips Rule: When choosing what you eat or drink, it should be a seven to 10 on a scale of one to 10, where one is medicine you have to force yourself to swallow and 10 is the best bite or sip you've ever had. Anything else, pass on, as we gain weight and get unhealthy from all the three to sixes we consume because they are \"just there.\"\n\nAnd weight loss specialist Dr. Adrienne Youdim tells patients, \"Eat what you want, provided that half your plate is green. By necessity, this cuts down on heavy stuff when you gotta get greens in.\"\n\nMake time for exercise\n\nDon't skip workouts, and be active whenever possible to burn off those holiday indulgences before they start to accumulate around your midsection. Take the stairs at the mall, park farther away at the grocery store, do pushups and jumping jacks while watching TV, and plan active outings for your family.\n\nGunnar Peterson , the Los Angeles Lakers' director of strength and endurance, suggests sequencing your strength-training workout by rotating through an upper-body exercise, a lower-body exercise and a core exercise, with no rest in between, to blast calories, build (or maintain) calorie-burning muscle and save time.\n\nLimit alcohol\n\nNot only are cocktails and alcoholic beverages high in calories , they increase appetite and decrease eating restraint, so they are a triple threat when it comes to maintaining your weight over the holidays. You don't need to restrict alcohol completely, just make sure to skip the high-sugar mixed drinks (opt for club and lime as a mixer instead) and alternate each alcoholic beverage (or any high-calorie drink) with a glass of sparkling water, Youdim suggests.\n\nBe wary of bite-size offerings\n\nBite-size appetizers and desserts can quickly add up to hundreds of extra calories, so pay attention and don't mindlessly eat appetizers or load your dessert plate with bite-size desserts. Limiting variety can help limit intake, as people tend to feel less satiated with more variety.\n\nGet on the scale regularly\n\nA new study in the British Medical Journal found that people who weighed themselves at least twice a week did not gain the typical 1 to 2 pounds that the average person gains over the holidays. If you hate weighing yourself, you can also choose a pair of snug pants to try on weekly to make sure your weight isn't creeping up.\n\nGet enough sleep\n\nHoliday parties, family dinners, shopping and travel can all cut into your sleep time, but do your best to get six to eight hours of sleep most nights. A study of adolescents found that intake of sweets increased 52% after sleep restriction , and total calorie intake increased 11%.\n\nEat less the day before or after indulging\n\nManage your calories like finances, nutrition physician Dr. Zhaoping Li suggests. If you have to borrow money, make money right away. It can be helpful to eat water-rich foods when you aren't going out to fill up with fewer calories. When you don't have social obligations, eat lots of non-cream-based soups, vegetables, yogurt, fruit and smoothies to balance out the extra calories you will be consuming the rest of the time.\n\nGet rid of leftovers\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you are having a party, stock up on Tupperware and send guests home with the leftovers, especially tasty holiday desserts.

MUST WATCH Breast cancer in young women 00:59\n\nNone of the women had breast cancer when they were enrolled in the studies, which involved data from several European countries, the United States and Australia.\n\nThe data showed that, compared with women who had not given birth, women with children had an elevated breast cancer risk that peaked around five years after childbirth and continued for about 20 years -- regardless of whether women breastfed or not.\n\nThe researchers then noticed that this difference in risk among women who had had children and women who hadn't shifted about 23.6 years after childbirth.\n\n\"That's actually the point at which we started to not see much of a difference between the women who had a child and women who had not had children,\" Nichols said. \"As you went further out from there, then the benefits of having children started to emerge.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that, even though breastfeeding did not appear to influence the findings, other factors did, including the age at which a woman first gave birth, how many children she had and whether she had a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\"One of the things that we want our study to be able to do is to contribute to new tools that will help predict breast cancer risk more effectively for young women -- so women who might be trying to decide with their providers when to start having mammogram screenings,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"In order to have a good tool to do that prediction, we need to know how risk factors operate in young women, and it's becoming increasingly clear that we can't take the information or the patterns we see in older women and apply them to younger women and assume they'll be the same,\" she said.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that any breast cancer diagnoses during pregnancy in the data were not uniformly distinguishable from diagnoses made during early postpartum.\n\nAlso, the study was unable to explore the biological mechanisms behind why an association between breast cancer risk and childbirth even exists, but Nichols offered some ideas.\n\n\"What could be happening is that pregnancy is a time when there is rapid development of the breast tissue, and the cells in the breast are rapidly dividing, and we know that when tissue is expanding quickly that there's more potential for an error to occur within a cell or an error that's already there in the cell to have multiple copies made of it,\" Nichols said.\n\n\"So we don't think it's actually anything about pregnancy that's causing breast cancer. We think that it's possible that this rapid expansion of the breast tissue might make it easier for cancer cells to either grow or be started,\" she said, but more research is needed.\n\n'This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing'\n\nThough there is no clear explanation for this increase in breast cancer risk, young women should be aware of the small risk -- and that it can last for more than 20 years, especially if the woman is older during her first birth, has had several pregnancies or has a family history of breast cancer, said Dr. Francisco Esteva, medical oncologist at NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"At the same time, screening mammograms are not generally recommended in women younger than 40 years of age,\" he said. \"Therefore, if these results are confirmed, we would need novel approaches to identify breast cancer early in younger women, especially after childbirth.\"\n\nStill, women also should know that the study findings should not influence their decision-making regarding having children, said Dr. Erica Mayer, a medical oncologist and clinical investigator in the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Deciding when to get pregnant, or whether or not to get pregnant, can be an intensely personal decision. This data should not be used to influence decisions about childbearing, as the cancer risks observed are overall fairly modest, as well as on a large population level, and it's difficult to extrapolate these risks to an individual person,\" Mayer said.\n\n\"However, evaluating personal cancer risk in a premenopausal woman is important,\" she said. \"If a woman has a history that may influence risk -- such as a family history of breast cancer -- then she should discuss with her doctor the timing of initiation of mammographic screening, as well as whether referral to a genetic counselor would be helpful to evaluate for a genetic risk of breast cancer.\"\n\nOverall, the study found what has been seen in previous research, Mayer said.\n\n\"It's known that pregnancy at a younger age may confer some long-term protective benefits against breast cancer, however it's also been recognized that in the immediate years following a pregnancy, there seems to be an increased risk of breast cancer that slowly resolves with time,\" she said. \"The findings in this paper support and confirm the prior observations.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Nichols and colleagues' results add to a large body of evidence demonstrating a transient increase in breast cancer risk after childbirth.

Because of these restrictions, these tests miss as many patients with hereditary cancers as they find, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\n\"Unfortunately, insurance companies pay attention to these guidelines,\" said Dr. Peter Beitsch , co-author of the study and a cancer surgeon practicing in Texas. Insurance companies and other payers reimburse genetic testing -- or not -- based on the guidelines.\n\nThe result: Patients without genetic test results might not receive the appropriate treatment for their cancer, which could be a matter of life or death.\n\nApproximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States and of these cases, an estimated 10% are likely due to hereditary causes, according to Beitsch.\n\nThe guidelines are two decades old\n\nThe guidelines for the genetic testing of breast cancer patients were established about 20 years ago by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , a nonprofit alliance of 28 cancer centers dedicated to improving patient care, explained Beitsch, who is a co-founder of the TME Breast Care Network, a nonprofit focused exclusively on advancing treatment for breast cancer patients.\n\n\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said. \"Back then we tested for two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA 2 ,\" said Beitsch. BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumor suppressor genes that everyone has; if a defect or mutation occurs in one or both of these genes, the likelihood of breast cancer is increased.\"Genetic testing was incredibly difficult to do and expensive; it cost about $5,000 to just test the two genes,\" he explained. The guidelines, then, \"originated really as an economic roadblock to try to decrease the overall cost of health care in America,\" he said.\n\nSince then it has become known that 11 \"major\" gene mutations, including BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, can cause breast cancer, while 25 or 30 other genetic variants are also linked to the disease, said Beitsch.\n\nMeanwhile, genetic testing \"radically changed. It went from a difficult-to-do, and expensive, test to a quite inexpensive test,\" said Beitsch. \"The cost dropped from, say, $5,000 for two genes to now we're doing 80 genes for about $250.\"\n\nWhile the guidelines also evolved, they \"got incredibly complicated,\" he said: \"unusable.\"\n\nSo Beitsch and his colleagues set up a study to look at nearly a thousand female breast cancer patients, half who met the criteria set forth in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the other half who did not. Among 959 study participants, all underwent a full panel of DNA testing for hereditary breast cancer.\n\nThe results showed that 83 women or 8.65% of the total participants, had breast cancer-linked genetic defects. Of these, 45 women met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria for testing, while 38 women did not. Ordinarily, then, these 38 women would not have been tested.\n\nGenetic testing may be a matter of life or death\n\nMany women who have breast cancer do not meet the criteria under the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, said Beitsch, and this affects their treatment and, potentially, their survival.\n\nDr. Otis Brawley , a professor in the department of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Emory University School of Medicine, explained that when a patient with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation is diagnosed, \"We treat them differently from a person with no known mutation.\" For example, surgical decisions and the use of chemotherapy might be based on whether a woman has a genetic mutation.\n\n\"Over the past 20 years we are learning of a number of genes that can have a mutation. Some change our treatment,\" said Brawley, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nGenetic testing, then, is not only important to a patient's survival, Beitsch said, \"but also for her family members as well.\" Carrying the same genetic mutation, a female relative may be at increased risk for breast cancer, while male relatives may be at increased risk for prostate and other cancers.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said that \"it's a misconception that men cannot be impacted by BRCA genes and it's a misconception that they cannot pass them onto their children.\"\n\n\"There's no question we don't test the people we know should be tested,\" including some patients with a \"family history that has cancer written all over it. Unfortunately, too many professionals don't pay attention,\" said Lichtenfeld, who did not contribute to the new research. One study, for example, suggests that fewer than one in five people who meet National Cancer Comprehensive Network criteria and have a history of breast cancer have actually undergone genetic testing.\n\n\"Then there's the group of people without a family history who want to get tested,\" he said.\n\nWill we all be routinely tested in the future?\n\npeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test. 2016 survey suggests that more than half -- 56% -- of American adults would be interested in taking a genetic test that indicated the likelihood of their developing cancer. The 30 to 64 age group had the highest proportion of willingpeople: 63% said they'd take a cancer predicting genetic test.\n\nDespite public interest and increasing knowledge of potential causes of cancer, insurance plans do not routinely cover the expense of medical genetic testing, said Lichtenfeld. And barriers exist even for those who most need to know the results of such tests, such as some women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, he said: \"Once [a woman] is diagnosed, unless she has a family history, a lot of payers, including Medicare, will not pay for the test.\"\n\nSome patients pay for the testing on their own, but this is not possible for all patients. And some patients may be unaware of the need for medical genetic tests because the guidelines do not recommend they get it.\n\nSince genetic tests are now relatively inexpensive, the reason for creating an \"economic roadblock\" no longer exists, Beitsch said, and so the guidelines should \"be wiped.\"\n\n\"The guidelines really don't help -- in fact, they hurt, they injure, they keep people who could benefit from genetic testing from getting it,\" said Beitsch, who hopes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network will recognize his study \"and take heed of it and hopefully change the guidelines.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLichtenfeld said cancer centers \"are finding many more people who have a hereditary basis for their cancer than would have been suspected based on our previous knowledge.\" Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, scientists have become increasingly adept at reading the mysterious code and what \"we don't understand today, we will understand tomorrow or next year or in the next decade,\" said Lichtenfeld. He believes that soon, genetic testing will be routine for newborns.\n\nBased on his new research, Beitsch cherishes a more modest hope that at the very least all breast cancer patients will be offered and reimbursed for genetic testing, and perhaps, the same for all cancer patients."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot for this mild season", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/02XttMre86w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Most US adults have not gotten a flu shot this season, according to a new survey from NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago.\n\nAs of mid-November, only 43% of surveyed people 18 or older said they had gotten vaccinated against the flu, according to NORC, which has conducted the National Immunization Survey for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2005. Another 14% who remain unvaccinated claim that they will get the shot, the survey indicates.\n\nEven if they do as they intend, that leaves considerably more than a third of adults (41%) who have not -- and will not -- get a flu shot, according to NORC. (The remaining 2% either did not answer or responded, \"I don't know.\")\n\nThe report comes early in what has been a mild season. Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico experienced minimal flu activity for the week ending December 1, while New York City and 10 states experienced low or moderate activity, according to Friday's weekly flu report from the CDC. Only two states, Georgia and Louisiana, experienced high activity during the week.\n\nThe mild season is a dramatic shift from the previous flu season, which was the deadliest in decades, with more than 80,000 flu-related deaths in the United States.\n\n'It's still very, very early'\n\n\"We cannot claim that the 43% of vaccinated people is the reason for the mild flu season so far,\" said Richard Webby, a flu scientist and adviser to the World Health Organization on recommendations for the composition of flu vaccines. Webby, who was not involved in the NORC survey, said vaccination rates are similar to those of years in which flu activity has been widespread and illness severe for many people.\n\n\"We've got to keep in mind that it's still very, very early, and even at this time last year, there hadn't been a huge amount of activity either,\" said Webby, a member of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.\n\nNo children died as a result of the flu during the week ended December 1, though five children died earlier this season, the CDC reported. Among adults, flu deaths are estimated based on pneumonia and other illnesses related to flu. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and flu was below the usual threshold for this time of year, the CDC said.\n\nAmong those who visited a doctor's office, just 2.2% said the reason for their visit was flu-like illness; this is considered a normal rate for this time of year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe report also showed a total of 383 hospitalizations reported since October 1, with slightly more than 1 flu-related hospitalization for every 100,000 people during the week ended December 1. The highest rates of hospitalization were among adults 65 or older and children younger than 4; both age groups saw slightly more than 3 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people.\n\nWebby said a \"slightly reassuring signal\" this year is that the H1N1 strain is the dominant strain of flu circulating.\n\n\"That's the strain that's a little bit better match to our vaccine,\" he said. \"It tends not to have quite the same impact that the H3N2 season does, and that's what we had last year.\" Influenza B strain viruses, which have the same symptoms as A-strain viruses, are also circulating this season as usual, the CDC said.\n\nThere were 1,105 new laboratory-confirmed cases during the week ending December 1, bringing the season total to 6,170, the CDC calculated. These numbers do not include all people infected with the flu, because many people do not seek medical help when they are sick and so go uncounted.\n\nWhy you should consider getting a flu shot\n\nThe most important response to seasonal flu, according to the CDC, is for everyone 6 months or older to get vaccinated. As long as flu is circulating in the area where you live, it is not too late to get vaccinated.\n\nLooking at the new NORC report, Webby worries about \"the quarter of people [age] 60-plus that are not getting vaccinated.\" Adults over 65, children under 2 and individuals with medical conditions not only should get a flu shot, they should get a pneumococcal vaccination to prevent pneumonia, according to the CDC. Flu is more likely to be severe or even deadly in these groups than among healthy adults.\n\nAbout half the people in the 18- to-44 age group also haven't gotten a flu shot, noted Webby, who believes that \"it's probably an uphill battle\" trying to increase these vaccination rates. After all, flu infections don't usually cause severe illness in this age group.\n\n\"We're struggling a little bit by the perception that flu is not really a deadly disease, which of course we know it is,\" he said. \"Perhaps the healthy adults are at a fairly small risk of getting a very very severe flu infection, but if they do get infected, they're potentially still infecting others. And how many people in that age group have young kids or have elderly parents?\"\n\nYoung children and the elderly are at higher risk of getting severe illness, Webby said: \"So by getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, but also, through herd immunity, you're protecting others.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of last year's flu shot was estimated to be 40%, meaning vaccination reduced an individual's risk of seeking medical care by 40%, according to the CDC. Among children, effectiveness rates were higher: Children who got the shot were 59% seek medical care for the virus , the CDC reported this year.\n\nThough the vaccine is imperfect, it lessens the severity and duration of symptoms, and those who get flu after receiving a vaccine are less likely to require hospitalization and less likely to die.\n\nWebby added that the vaccine is also safe. Though some people report a sore arm after getting the shot, the overwhelming majority experience no extreme side effects.\n\n\"The vaccine has been given to many people every year with a very good safety record,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/MKcZllpiCMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There have been 18 more cases of illness and five more deaths reported in just two days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health.

If she was no longer Conservative Party leader she would also be expected to step down as prime minister.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nSo far 26 MPs have publicly said they have written such letters - 48 of them are needed to trigger a vote.\n\nSeparately, Labour is coming under pressure from the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to call a vote of no confidence among all MPs to try and bring down Theresa May's government - something that can, effectively, only be done by the main opposition party.\n\nThe Labour leader told MPs he had no confidence in the government but his party needed \"to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time\" if it was to succeed in bringing it down.\n\nAnalysis: Confused and angry\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Even old hands in Westminster are struggling to make sense of what is going on\n\nBy BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley\n\nParliament feels like a confused and sometimes angry place today. As Theresa May fights for further assurances on the backstop, many are unconvinced. Even among Conservatives loyal to her, the mood is bleak.\n\nOne Tory MP who supported the PM's deal told me they didn't have a clue what was happening now. \"We're rewriting the pantomime,\" they added. Another pondered: \"The Conservatives made this muddle - who is going to fix it?\" One minister concluded things were at \"breaking point\".\n\nBrexiteers speak openly of exasperation.\n\nOne source, who has been highly critical of the plan but not the PM, told me many were changing their minds now; Mrs May is now seen as the problem. It's not the first time we've heard such claims - and in the past they haven't materialised.\n\nBut this person said a number of Brexit backers who have resisted pressure to send in letters calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM as Tory leader have now changed their minds.\n\n\"And it's not just the usual suspects,\" they added.\n\nSo far, there's no sign the 48 threshold has been reached and there's no guarantee it will. But Westminster is again rife with speculation."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit vote: What could happen next?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46393399", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "The government has delayed the vote in the House of Commons on the proposed Brexit deal.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May is going to Brussels to seek \"additional reassurance\" about the backstop. That's the part of the withdrawal agreement that would prevent a \"hard\" border on the island of Ireland if no trade agreement is reached between the EU and UK by the end of the \"transition period\".\n\nIt's not clear when MPs will now get the chance to vote, but the Brexit deal cannot be legally implemented until it has been approved by them.\n\nWhat would happen if it was rejected?\n\nThe EU Withdrawal Act, passed by Parliament in June, sets out some rules. The government would have to produce a new plan of action within 21 days and then allow a further vote within another seven sitting days in the House of Commons.\n\nHowever, the government could act much more quickly than that. And it's possible that political events would transform the situation.\n\nFollowing a government defeat in the Commons last week, MPs would now have more say in proposing alternatives to any plan of action - but these would still have to be put into law by the government.\n\nThe European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries). With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move.\n\nIn the event that MPs eventually do reject the Brexit deal, some of the most likely options are set out below.\n\n1. No deal\n\nIf nothing else happens, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. And, in any case, EU rules mean the UK would leave then.\n\nThe government would probably want to pass some legislation to prepare for no-deal but that's not strictly essential.\n\nIf MPs aren't happy with the plan they could try to put pressure on the government to change its mind. Their ultimate sanction, if the government wouldn't budge, would be a vote of no confidence - see section four below.\n\n2. Major renegotiation\n\nIf MPs vote against the deal, the government could propose to negotiate a new Brexit deal.\n\nThis would not be a question of carrying out minor tweaks and having a second vote. That approach now seems less realistic after the government delayed the vote so Theresa May could go to Brussels and seek clarifications.\n\nInstead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time and might well require an extension of Article 50 to delay Brexit.\n\nThis would require two key steps. First, the UK would have to make a request to the EU for an extension. This could be granted but only if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council.\n\nAlternative ways to break Brexit impasse\n\nThe withdrawal agreement - what it all means\n\nNumber crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal?\n\nA guide to where we are with Brexit\n\nSecond, the government would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of \"exit day\" in the EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change.\n\nIf the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead.\n\n3. Call for a general election\n\nTheresa May could decide that the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election - in order to get a political mandate for her deal.\n\nShe doesn't have the power just to call an election. But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.\n\nTwo-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move. The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date.\n\nAs with the \"renegotiate\" plan, this course of action could also involve a request to the EU to extend Article 50.\n\nAnd it's not the only way an election could come about.\n\n4. Vote of no confidence\n\nIf the proposed deal is rejected the opposition could call for a formal vote of no confidence. Mrs May could even call for a vote herself to try to reinforce her authority.\n\nThe rules, under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, mean there are several possible outcomes if the government loses a formal vote of no confidence.\n\nIf no government is able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days - and that means neither the existing government nor any alternative - then there would be an early general election. The earliest possible date for the election would be 25 working days later.\n\nHowever, if the government wins a confidence motion within this 14-day period, perhaps by offering some new concession, it carries on.\n\nThe final possibility is a change of government. That could mean another minority Conservative government with a different prime minister, a coalition government, or a minority government of a different party which had the agreement of others to back it in a confidence vote.\n\nClearly, any new government could have a different Brexit policy so the various options could be re-opened.\n\n5. Another referendum\n\nThe government could instead choose to have another referendum.\n\nAs with a renegotiation or early election, this might well require an extension to Article 50. It's probably already too late to hold a referendum before 29 March.\n\nAnd it can't just happen automatically. The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\n\nThere would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote.\n\nIt couldn't be rushed through because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question.\n\nThe question is then defined in the legislation.\n\nOnce the legislation has been passed the referendum couldn't happen immediately either. There would have to be a statutory \"referendum period\" before the vote takes place.\n\nExperts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks.\n\nEven if that could be shortened a little, it would still take us well beyond the end of March.\n\n6. Other consequences\n\nAs well as the various options for what could happen with Brexit, there could be a lot of other political events going on as well.\n\nIt's possible, for example, that Theresa May will face a leadership challenge.\n\nIf 48 Conservative MPs write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee there would be a vote of no confidence in Mrs May's leadership among the parliamentary party.\n\nThis would be completely different from any parliamentary vote of no confidence. But it could also result in a change of Conservative leader and, hence, change of prime minister.\n\nWhoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of options."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Man held by armed police at UK Parliament", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46524839", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:00:18", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg witnessed the man being pinned to the ground by police\n\nA man has been arrested by armed police officers after it is believed he broke into the grounds of Parliament.\n\nAn eyewitness told the BBC the man jumped over railings before being Tasered by police.\n\nThe man was held within the parliamentary courtyard but has now been taken away in a police van.\n\nPolice say he has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site and is not being investigated by the Met's counter terrorism command.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said the man ran towards officers and a Taser was used when he did not comply with their requests to stop.\n\nHe is to undergo a mental health assessment, police said.\n\nThey would not say whether the man was armed.\n\nParliamentary authorities say the incident, which happened just before midday on Tuesday, is contained.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Police Taser the man\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The man is then arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site\n\nChristopher Hope, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, told BBC News: \"I heard a scream and then looked out the window, and then about half a dozen police officers who appeared not to be armed were running towards a man.\n\n\"And then it appears the man was Tasered.\n\n\"It appears to be contained now.

Preliminary results of various investigations are being reported here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists.\n\nThe quake occurred on what is called a strike-slip fault, where the ground on one side of a rupture moves horizontally past the ground on the other side. It is not a configuration normally associated with very large tsunamis.\n\nNevertheless, this is what happened in the early evening of 28 September, around prayer time.\n\nTwo main surges of water were observed, the second being the biggest and pushing up to 400m inland.\n\nUdrekh Al Hanif, from the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, told the meeting that the generation source of the tsunami had to be very close to the city because of the short interval between the onset of the quake and the arrival of the high water - less than three minutes.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Scientists have sought answers on the bay floor\n\nHe and colleagues have sought answers in a depth (bathymetric) map of the long, narrow inlet that leads to Palu at its head. The team is still working through the results, but the data indicates the seafloor in much of the bay dropped down in the quake.\n\nThis, combined with a sharp movement of the crust northwards, could certainly have produced a tsunami, the Indonesian scientist said.\n\n\"When we overlap the bathymetric data from before and after, we can see that almost all of the area of the seafloor inside the bay subsides. And from this data, we can also observe [the movement] to the north. So, actually, we have a vertical and a horizontal displacement,\" Udrekh Al Hanif told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Looking south down the bay towards Palu: The seafloor dropped in response to the quake\n\nWhether this behaviour was enough on its own to explain the tsunami's size is still open to question.\n\nThere is evidence of several underwater landslides in the data. These, too, could have been a factor.\n\nAnother possibility is an upwards thrust of the seabed in a zone some distance from Palu where the strike-slip fault splits into diverging tracks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down\n\nMovement on both tracks at the same time might have compressed the crust in between.\n\n\"This was a very unusual event but the tectonics tell us it could happen again,\" said Finn L\u00f8vholt from the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute.\n\n\"Indeed, this is not the first time an event has happened in Palu.

Local people call this \"Nalodo\", which means something like \"buried in black\".\n\nHermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said Palu demonstrated the challenge confronting the local population. \"This tsunami arrived very fast, within minutes,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That basically leaves no time for warnings. That's very different from Japan (in 2011) where there was an eternity of time - more than 30 minutes everywhere until the first person was killed by the tsunami. That's the challenge for these local tsunamis: people have to self-evacuate.\"\n\nWidjo Kongko, also from the BPPT, spoke of some complacency following an emergency drill conducted in Palu in 2012. \"It said go to high ground within 5-10 minutes.

Pretty much everything else in that part of the continent was considered stagnant, however.\n\nThe new satellite elevation and velocity maps change this view. They make it clear that nearby glaciers to Totten are also starting to respond in a similar way.\n\nMarked change is detected in the Vincennes Bay and Denman areas just to the west, and in Porpoise Bay and on the George VI coast to the east.\n\nVincennes Bay - which includes the Underwood, Bond, Adams, and Vanderford glaciers - has the most pronounced loss in ice mass. Elevation is dropping at five times the rate it was in 2008 - with a total fall in height over the period of almost 3m.\n\n\"They've also sped up about 3% from their 2008 velocity, which sounds small but is significant enough to change the flux coming out of those glaciers because they are very deep,\" said Dr Walker.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Totten has long been recognised as the fastest moving glacier in East Antarctica\n\nOnce again the melting culprit is likely to be warm water that is being pulled up from the deep by shifting sea-ice and wind patterns in the region.\n\nThe changes that are occurring are still quite subtle, and they are only really discernible because of the new automated computer tools that will search through the millions of satellite images taken of Antarctica.\n\nNasa is about to widen access to these tools through a project called Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation, or ITS_LIVE.\n\n\"I think we can anticipate that over the next five to 10 years, we're going to have a lot of observationally driven discoveries, such as what Catherine is making, because of the new data that's coming online,\" said Alex Gardner, a glaciologist with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Protecting the poor from green taxes", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46522126", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protests\n\nAs President Macron caved into the yellow vest fuel tax protests, President Trump was triumphant.\n\nThe French humiliation showed people rejected the sort of carbon taxes supported by the UN\u2019s climate deal, he tweeted.\n\nOf course it\u2019s more complicated than that, because it depends on what sort of carbon taxes and how they are imposed.\n\nGreen economists say carbon taxes are a good idea - but they insist that governments must protect the poor from the side-effects.\n\nWhy are the poor vulnerable to green taxes?\n\nIt\u2019s a question of disposable income. If a government imposes a flat tax on motor fuel as Mr Macron did, that hits the poor hardest because it eats their disposable income.\n\nThe fuel rises were doubly galling for the yellow vests in their suburban and rural homes because they can\u2019t rely on good public transport like rich city slickers do.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The tax was supposed to help reduce carbon emissions\n\nThe UK faced a less violent protest in 2001 when the past Labour government tried to notch up a petrol tax rise with its annual \u201cfuel tax escalator\u201d.\n\nThe policy had succeeded in suppressing the relentless rise in traffic, and prompted more fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\nBut the Conservative opposition leader William Hague quipped: \u201cIf you\u2019re on an escalator you have to know when to get off!\u201d\n\nSo how can the poor be protected?\n\nAcademics have figured out over the years how to protect the poor from green taxes, but Mr Macron appears to have missed their research, or ignored it.\n\nHis fuel tax took from people struggling with living costs, and diverted the proceeds to wind farms instead.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nA very different Robin Hood policy in Australia deliberately re-directed carbon taxes to help the worse-off.\n\nIt took the $5bn Australian dollars ($3.6bn; \u00a32.9bn) of annual profits from a carbon tax on industry and diverted it to the poor by introducing lower income taxes and higher welfare payments.\n\nMost households - and just about all poor households - were better off as a result, whereas richer households bore most of the costs, according to Prof Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nWhy are green taxes on the rise?\n\nPollution imposes costs on society, and most governments accept that people and businesses should pay for the pollution they cause.\n\nWith climate change, for instance, carbon emissions are likely to damage crops; increase health care costs from heatwaves; and droughts; make flooding worse; inundate homes from sea level rise - and much more.\n\nAs a result, the World Bank says, carbon taxes have been introduced in 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces. Many more schemes are in the pipeline.\n\nTogether they cover about 13% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, and are, according to the Bank, the cheapest way for nations to cut emissions because they allow businesses to choose when and how to invest in clean technology.\n\nIt says carbon prices stimulates innovation and fuels new low-carbon drivers of economic growth.\n\nSo are green economists cursing Mr Macron?\n\nEnvironmental economists will be appalled that the Macron policies have made carbon taxes more politically toxic just as governments need good solutions to climate change.\n\nWorld-leading research into the social impacts of green taxes has been done at University College London by Prof Paul Ekins.\n\nHe says governments must think hard about protecting the poor before they introduce taxes.\n\nEven then, he says, ministers may have to devise special measures to support small groups of households faced with higher bills because - say - they have a sick family member who needs to be kept very warm.\n\nDo people support green taxes?\n\nThere\u2019s one final problem\u2026 green taxes are complicated and can be hard to communicate.\n\nIn Australia, for instance, the coal industry has a very loud voice in public debate. And it supported the claim of the right-wing politician Tony Abbott that the carbon tax was: \u201cA big fat tax on everything\u201d.\n\nThe tax was scrapped, even though Prof Jotzo says the poor were actually better off since it was imposed.\n\nPeople believed the rhetoric rather than the evidence of their bank accounts, he says.\n\n\"The Australian experience shows that governments need to design environmental policies to leave lower income people better off, and then also to explain this to the voters,\" Prof Jotzo says.\n\n\"Just doing the right thing is not enough, you need to also cut through the noise and misinformation...

Weeks later, undercover forces - including one pretending to a pregnant woman - raided a Hebron hospital and killed an unarmed civilian.\n\nA spokesperson for prisoners' rights NGO, Addameer, told Al Jazeera \"undercover forces are usually seen in protests, raids or arrest operations\", adding that the group sees those kinds of arrests as \"more like a kidnapping operation\" than an arrest.\n\nAddameer stressed it \"considers all arrests in the West Bank to be carried out illegally especially because almost none of them would have a legal arrest warrant to present during the arrest\".\n\nWhile the NGO does not hold exact statistics as to how many Palestinians are arrested in this manner, it pointed to an example earlier this year of Israeli undercover forces raiding Birzeit University campus - reportedly posing as journalists - to detain the student union head.\n\nNo accountability\n\nSuch actions, however, generate little to no debate within Israel, according to Mack.\n\n\"Nobody is talking about it, what it means in terms of international law,\" he said. \"And in the case of Gaza, for most Israelis it's not even that they don't care - they simply don't even see that there is a place called Gaza. It's a blind spot; what happens in Gaza is left in Gaza.\"\n\nIn the absence of public pressure, there is even less possibility of accountability, observers say.\n\n\"In Israel, no one pays for undertaking covert operations, killing Palestinians and placing foreign workers at harm,\" Buttu said.\n\n\"Sadly, the international community has barely spoken out, preferring instead to focus on 'ceasefires' and condemning 'both sides'.\"\n\nMack similarly believes that the silence of the international community - including \"humanitarian organisations\" - is part of what emboldens Israel to conduct such operations.\n\n\"It's very, very worrying, because one of the basic principles of international humanitarian law is that the fighting groups will not use humanitarian groups as symbols to shield themselves.\"\n\n\"This kind of operation always has a risk,\" Mack continued, \"so if the Netanyahu government felt that there would be international accountability for using a humanitarian NGO as a cover, it wouldn't do it.\"\n\nYet not only has there been no accountability, but there are signs that the Israeli authorities' own efforts to censor the story are being supported by Twitter, with a number of accounts ordered to delete tweets pertaining to Israeli undercover forces' actions in Gaza.\n\nStein told Al Jazeera she would be surprised if anyone would be held to account for the actions in Gaza.\n\n\"According to publications in the press, this operation was approved by high-ranking officers in the army and in the political level\", she said.\n\n\"And in any case, as B'Tselem has written in the past, the so-called law enforcement system in the army hardly results in meaningful action against any of the forces involved and is more concerned with whitewashing than with justice and truth\"."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Q&A: MSF's Joanne Liu on the future of migration", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/qa-msf-international-president-future-migration-181211145423298.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Marrakech, Morocco - The sea route between Libya and Italy is the world's deadliest for migrants and refugees, according to the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR.\n\nMore than 2,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year, according to the International Organization of Migration.\n\nMedical humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym MSF) was forced last Thursday to shut down its search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean on board the vessel Aquarius, blaming a \"dishonest smearing and obstructive campaign\".\n\nMSF said its activities on Aquarius, carried out jointly with SOS Mediterranee, assisted nearly 30,000 people in international waters between Libya, Italy and Malta since the operations started in February 2016.\n\n181210092353957\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to MSF's International President Joanne Liu on the sidelines of an intergovernmental conference on global migration about Aquarius' future, the \"campaign\" against migrants, and the detention centres in Libya that the rescued migrants will be taken back to.\n\nAl Jazeera: How difficult was it to continue operations in recent months and what forced you to stop them?\n\nJoanne Liu: The last few months, rescuing people in the Mediterranean was made more and more difficult for us. We were regularly blocked and impeded in trying to save lives. We tried to get a flag for several weeks but things didn't work out. First Gibraltar and then Panama, under increasing pressure from different states, decided to withdraw the flag. So we decided that we needed to close that sequence and see how we go forward.\n\nAl Jazeera: What kind of pressure from states were you under?\n\nLiu: Reality is that it was part of a bigger obstructive campaign, a dishonest smearing campaign that attacked us for being in collusion with the smugglers and the mafia.\n\nAl Jazeera: What happens now with the Aquarius and the rescue mission?\n\nLiu: With the sabotage of the Aquarius, gone is the most basic humanitarian and legal commitment: saving lives at sea.\n\nFor the time being, we are re-assessing so it's a bit too early to answer that. We can't resume unless we have a boat flag. There's no sign of that happening right now. We are here at the conference in Morocco that is looking for safer migration routes. We will talk to the countries present and put forward what the reality is.\n\nIt's clear that migration is a very, very politically loaded issue. Countries need to understand that human rights of a person do not disappear as soon as they cross the border. We just can't understand why saving lives has become illegal.\n\nAl Jazeera: What are the countries opposing your operations saying to this?\n\nLiu: Right now, it is being portrayed that the number of migrants reaching the shores of Europe is decreasing. That's being shown as a success story by these people. But on the flip side, that's because more and more people are being rescued by the Libyan coastguards and taken back to the filthy, overcrowded detention centres in Libya where almost 5,000 of them are living in inhumane conditions. We're telling them that the cost of their success is human lives and dignity.\n\nAl Jazeera: What is the condition of these detainees in those centres?\n\nLiu: These people are deprived of their human rights just because they are migrating somewhere and asking for protection.\n\nAt the centres, we have been told stories of harassment, abuse and rape. These people are kept in unventilated, filthy rooms. They are underfed and deprived of basic humanitarian conditions.\n\nThese places are basically centres for abuse. For people who wanted safety for themselves and their families.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/refugee-ship-aquarius-stop-rescue-mission-mediterranean-181207062845983.html\n\nAl Jazeera: So will this UN migration pact, agreed upon by 164 countries, make a difference to these people's lives?\n\nLiu: Things change when you want them to change. We have more than 160 countries who have adopted the Global Compact for Migration (GCM). Now it's important to keep the pressure on them so that it translates into concrete action instead of just being government policies that is deepening the suffering of the population along the migratory routes.\n\nSaving lives is non-negotiable.

But in the ensuing weeks, Rajapaksa could not muster enough support in parliament, and Sirisena subsequently dissolved the 225-member House and called for snap elections to take place in January.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, halted the president's moves amid a legal challenge, allowing parliament to resume. The top court is due to deliver a verdict on the case later this week.\n\nAjith Perera, a member of Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP), told Al Jazeera the lawsuit against the overthrown leader was \"filed out of desperation\".\n\n\"I am sure the court will throw the case out,\" he said. \"They have filed this case to rattle us because they have lost so much face due to previous court decisions.\"\n\nIn 1999, the Court of Appeal stripped a Sri Lankan legislator of his seat after it found the politician was involved in a company supplying dental equipment to the government.\n\n'People power campaign'\n\nThe lawsuit against Wickremesinghe, who insists his sacking was unconstitutional, came after he called for mass demonstrations to pressure Sirisena to reinstate him.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, he said he commanded the support of parliament and Sirisena has until Friday to recognise that.\n\nWickremesinghe - who is confident of a top court ruling against Sirisena \u2013 said tens of thousands of the party faithful would rally in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, if the president did not heed the court's decision.\n\n\"After the court ruling, we will launch our 'People Power' campaign to force the president to end the crisis,\" he said.\n\nThe UNP is also expected to table a motion requesting a vote on Wickremesinghe's support in parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThe party commands the support of 103 legislators in the 225-member House and expects the Tamil National Alliance, a coalition of 14 legislators who represent the country's ethnic Tamil minority, to back the resolution.\n\nSirisena has previously refused to reinstate Wickremesinghe. In November, he said: \"Even if the UNP has the majority, I told them not to bring Ranil Wickremesinghe before me, I will not make him prime minister ... not in my lifetime.\"\n\nThe former allies had fallen out over economic policy, day-to-day administration, and what Sirisena said was the involvement of a Wickremesinghe ally in an alleged assassination plot against him.\n\nMeanwhile, the court of appeal's decision on December 3 to temporarily bar Rajapaksa and his cabinet has left Sri Lanka without a government.\n\nOn the same day, Sirisena met with the top bureaucrats from government ministries and instructed them to \"continue their duties and ensure there was no breakdown in public services\".\n\nHe has held regular meetings with the civil servants since.\n\n'Major consequences'\n\nRajitha Keerthi Tennakoon, a Colombo-based political analyst, said the government's suspension had \"reduced the activities of the public sector tremendously\".\n\nHowever, \"there has been no breakdown as of yet and there are no problems in obtaining public services such as health and education,\" Tennakoon told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"But this will have major consequences in the long term.\"\n\n181108014228212\n\nChief among the concerns was the parliament's failure to approve a budget for 2019.\n\nWickremesinghe's UNP in a post on Twitter on Tuesday said Sirisena's refusal to \"appoint a legitimate government\" meant more than one million government servants will not receive salaries after January 1, 2019.\n\nLakshman Silva, a 62-year-old former civil servant, told Al Jazeera he was \"worried\" about receiving his pension payment.\n\nThe parliament's failure to pass a budget means \"I might not have an income from next year,\" he said, adding: \"I don't have a lot of savings \u2026 so I am really worried about the next few months and I hope things will be sorted, I don't care how.\"\n\nThe protracted crisis has also hit the country's economy.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:16", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage.

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

potential for abuse, was highlighted during a meeting between the leaders of the United States and China in Buenos Aires earlier this month, some analysts in China saw it as another one of Washington's tactics to embarrass China.\n\nOthers, however, note that reaching out to China to contain its deadliest export to the United States may not be enough if the country doesn\u2019t ease its dependence on painkillers.\n\nGame changer\n\nXi has promised to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl to the United States, according to Trump, who said it has the possibility of being \u201ca game changer\u201d in easing the fentanyl overdose epidemic in the United States.\n\n\u201cLast year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl [in the US]. If China cracks down on this \u2018horror drug,\u2019 using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!\u201d Trump tweeted last week.\n\nChina is the biggest source of illicit fentanyl-like substances in the United States and their flows have persisted in recent years through China\u2019s vast, but poorly monitored and weakly regulated chemical and pharmaceutical industries, according to a report released last month by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nMaking matters worse, Beijing schedules reviews of chemicals one by one \u2013 a slow and ineffective procedure, which allows room for illicit manufacturers to create new substances faster than they can be controlled, the report added.\n\nIn other words, even though China has banned nearly 40 new fentanyl-like substances after years of pressure from U.S. officials, opioid chemists can still concoct new narcotics to get around customs blacklists.\n\nAn uphill battle\n\nThat has turned Sino-U.S. counter-narcotic cooperation into an uphill battle.\n\nAn industry watcher in Beijing, who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity, said concocting new clones to skirt the ban is easy and quick.\n\n\"China may not necessarily be the major source of [fentanyl] flows to the U.S. [Flows from China] may not outsize those from Latin American countries because any [opioid chemist] is capable of making it. Those in the U.S. may be able to easily produce it in their own garages,\" the industry watcher said.\n\nA more efficient way to combat the illicit drug would be for both countries to impose a \"white list\" of fentanyl substances so that most illicit fentanyl derivatives on the list would be systemically banned, he said.\n\nFor example, the industry watcher added, only licensed pharmaceuticals would be allowed to manufacture an approved list of fentanyl-related substances for medical use, which would make it easy for Chinese authorities to monitor their flows given that China\u2019s regulation of the pharmaceutical industry is stricter than the chemical industry.\n\nAddressing regulatory loopholes\n\nThe United States, for its part, is urging Beijing to consider establishing fentanyl as its own class of controlled substances so that all known and future fentanyl analogues are automatically controlled in China.\n\nOr China should commit to targeting U.S.-bound exports of substances controlled in the United States, but not in China, as such all substances controlled by U.S. regulators would also be automatically illegal in China, according to the review commission.\n\nBut Ming Xia, a professor of political science and global affairs at City University of New York, doubted if incentives are strong enough for China to fight the United State\u2019s fentanyl war unless the controlled substances become a lethal addiction among its own youth.\n\n\u201cFor now, China only gains from its chemical exports, but no cost to pay for. China may consider the abuse of such chemical exports none of its business. Therefore, China may not be strongly motivated to contain its [fentanyl] exports,\u201d Xia said.\n\nThe New York-based professor, however, urged China to take the drug war seriously because its own young people may one day become addicted.\n\nHe also urges the United States to strengthen its oversight on the flow of the controlled substance and cut down its huge dependence on painkillers, which makes it a natural destination of opioid imports in great quantities with an increased potential for overdose or abuse.\n\nNo comment\n\nSince the G-20 meeting, China hasn\u2019t yet announced any concrete measures or policy reforms to tackle existing legal loopholes and improve regulatory efficiency or oversight of chemical productions.\n\nTougher restrictions on chemical exports are believed to have a negative impact on China\u2019s future economic growth.\n\nGiven the issue\u2019s sensitivity, two narcotics experts in Beijing with the People\u2019s Public Security University of China have declined VOA\u2019s requests for comments.\n\nChina, however, is cooperating with U.S. law enforcement agencies in their efforts to take legal actions against known Chinese drug traffickers.\n\nA group of 21 people recently pleaded guilty in a court in Xingtai, Hebei, over their illicit trade of drugs, including fentanyl by courier or post to countries such as the United States and Canada."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "For Several Reasons, Democrats Cautious About the 'I' Word", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-cautious-impeachment/4695709.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Some Democrats who will take the House majority in January are willing to say that President Donald Trump may have committed impeachable offenses. But that doesn't mean they will try to impeach him \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nFor several reasons, Democrats have been extremely cautious about the \"I\" word. They know it could backfire politically, and many of them were in office during President Bill Clinton's impeachment 20 years ago. New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and the panel's likely incoming chairman, has called impeachment a \"trauma.\"\n\n\n\nNadler told CNN on Sunday that if it is proved that Trump directed his former lawyer to commit campaign finance violations, as was suggested by special counsel Robert Mueller in a new court filing, he believes it would be an impeachable offense. But Nadler added, \"Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question.\"\n\n\n\nIt's unclear whether the distinction between an impeachable offense and impeachment itself will satisfy those in the Democratic base who are eager to kick Trump out of office. But Democrats are walking that fine line, for now.\n\n\n\nFive reasons Democrats aren't ready to impeach Trump:\n\n\n\nOther shoes to drop\n\n\n\nIn filings on Friday, Mueller's prosecutors asserted that Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, committed campaign finance violations \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump. It's the first time they have directly tied Trump to a federal crime.\n\n\n\nThe violations stemmed from payments Cohen made to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both women alleged they had affairs with Trump, which the White House denies. Trump also denies knowing about the payment, but the filing contradicts that claim.\n\n\n\nThere is likely more to come from Mueller. Charges are expected related to emails stolen during the 2016 presidential election that could implicate some in Trump's circle. And Mueller could complete a larger report at the conclusion of his investigation.\n\n\n\nIf Democrats move to impeach Trump, it will likely be for more than just campaign finance violations.\n\n\n\nIt could backfire\n\n\n\nDemocrats are cognizant of the price that Republicans paid for Clinton's impeachment 20 years ago. Both Nadler and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi were in Congress at the time, and Nadler sat on the Judiciary panel. Republicans were seen as overreaching, and that helped boost Clinton's poll numbers and win Democrats seats in the 1998 midterm election.\n\n\n\nPelosi was also under pressure to impeach President George W. Bush in 2006 when she first became speaker of the House. She has said that if Democrats had spent their first two years in the majority trying to impeach Bush, voters may never have elected Barack Obama as president in 2008.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are also aware that impeachment could backfire.\n\n\n\n\"I think it'll help the president get re-elected,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the possibility Democrats would move for impeachment. \"This business of presidential harassment may or may not be quite the winner they think it is.\"\n\nRepublican buy-in needed\n\n\n\nPelosi has called impeachment a \"divisive activity\" that needs buy-in from both parties to work. \"If the case is there, then that should be self-evident to Democrats and Republicans,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNadler has said the same, that there would have to be at least some Republican support if they take the step of initiating impeachment proceedings.\n\n\n\nIf the Democrats hold to that, it would mean Mueller would have to produce a lot more evidence of Trump's involvement in crimes. No Republicans have so far come close to supporting impeachment, and many moderate Republicans critical of Trump lost their re-election races in November.\n\n\n\nChecking Trump in other ways\n\n\n\nDemocrats have tried to keep the public focus on investigating the president and moving forward on policy like improving infrastructure and lowering health care costs.\n\n\n\nSeveral Democrat-led committees are expected to initiate investigations of Trump and the White House, including on whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization. They will also try to protect Mueller's investigation through legislation.\n\n\n\nFreshmen lawmakers who won competitive districts and handed Democrats the majority have made it clear they don't want to focus on issues like impeachment.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said shortly after the election that his constituents \"don't just want to see us argue and investigate and have hearings.\"\n\n\n\nWhat happens next\n\n\n\nIn the end, even if the Democratic House approved articles of impeachment, the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict. And that would be unlikely in a Republican-led Senate.\n\n\n\nAnd some Senate Democrats might be reluctant to support impeachment, as well, since several of them represent swing states.\n\n\n\n\"My concern is that, if impeachment is moved forward on the evidence that we have now, at least a third of the country would think it was just political revenge and a coup against the president,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday. \"That wouldn't serve us well at all.

In the year and a half since Robert Mueller took over the investigation into possible collusion, charging documents have alleged that more than a dozen Trump associates \u2013 from former campaign manager Paul Manafort to son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner \u2013 communicated with Russians, in one form or another, during and after the election.\n\nWhile the Mueller investigation operates under grand jury secrecy, the evidence the special prosecutor has referenced in court documents points to deeper and broader than previously thought contacts between people in Trump\u2019s orbit and Russian operatives who sought to gain influence with the Republican president.\n\nThe latest revelation on the nexus between Trump and Russia appeared in a sentencing memo for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen who pleaded guilty last week to lying to Congress about Trump's efforts, during the campaign, to build a Trump tower in Moscow.\n\nLast year, Cohen told lawmakers that his efforts on behalf of Trump to win Russian approval and build a new high rise in Moscow ended in January 2016, just as the campaign was heating up, whereas in fact they continued through June 2016, shortly before Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination. In the memo, Mueller\u2019s prosecutors wrote that Cohen, who once said he would \"take a bullet\u201d for Trump but subsequently turned on his former boss, has provided \u201cinformation about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign and discussions with others in the course of making those contacts.\u201d\n\nCohen, who broached the possibility of a meeting in New York between Putin and Trump during the U.N. General Assembly in September 2016, has told prosecutors that he had \"conferred\" with Trump about the idea before \u201creaching out to gauge Russia\u2019s interest in such a meeting,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe meeting did not take place for reasons that prosecutors did not reveal.\n\nRussian attempts to set up such a meeting persisted, however. In November 2016, Cohen spoke with a Russian who offered \"political synergy\" with the campaign and \"repeatedly proposed a meeting between Putin and Trump.\n\n\u201cThe person told Cohen that such a meeting could have a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 impact \u2018not only in political but in a business dimension\u2019\u2026 because there is \u2018no bigger warranty in any project than consent of [the President of Russia,]\u2019\u201d according to the memo.\n\nCohen did not follow up on the invitation, according to the court filing, explaining to prosecutors that \u201che was working on the Moscow Project with a different individual who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.\u201d\n\nThe unidentified individual is believed to be Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer who worked as an adviser for the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump's interest in doing business with Russia goes back decades. In 2013, he brought the Miss Universe beauty pageant to Moscow. Throughout the 2016 campaign Trump repeatedly praised Putin and reveled in the Russian president's compliments before the relationship soured after the election.\n\nThe latest filings came at the end of a whirlwind week in the Russia investigation that saw similar documents filed in criminal cases involving Manafort and former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in denying he had conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. shortly after the election and before Trump took office, at a time Russia was trying to get out from under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Cohen sentencing memo represents the first time the special counsel has alleged a discussion between Trump and his lawyer about a meeting with Putin during the 2016 election.It suggests that Trump remained focused on his business interests even as he was running for the White House.\n\n\u201cIf the project was completed, the Company could have received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues,\u201d the Cohen sentencing memo says.\n\nOther Trump associates accused of interacting with Russia during and after the 2016 campaign include former attorney general Jeff Sessions who met with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign and former campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos who tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin during the campaign."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Former US Senators Warn of 'Dangerous Period' Ahead", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senators-trump/4695507.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "A group of former U.S. Senate members from both the Democratic and Republican parties is urging current members to be \"guardians of our democracy\" and not let party affiliation get in the way of the interests of the country as it faces a \"critical juncture.\"\n\nThe 44 former lawmakers wrote in an op-ed published Monday by the Washington Post that the United States is \"entering a dangerous period\" and they felt they needed to \"speak up about serious challenges to the rule of law, the Constitution, our governing institutions and our national security.\"\n\nThey cited the eventual conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with President Donald Trump's campaign, as well as the planned investigations of the Trump administration by the Democrat-led House of Representatives that will be in place next month as challenges that are coming amid regional and global conflicts.\n\n\"We are at an inflection point in which the foundational principles of our democracy and our national security interests are at stake, and the rule of law and the ability of our institutions to function freely and independently must be upheld,\" they wrote.\n\nThe group includes Democrats John Kerry, Tom Daschle and Chris Dodd, as well as Republicans John Warner, Richard Lugar and Chuck Hagel."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump: US Southern Border Secure, but Wants Wall Funding", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawmakers-scramble-to-avoid-shutdown/4694354.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "U .S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday proclaimed the country's southern border with Mexico secure against illegal migration, but said that if opposition Democrats don't give him the votes to build a border wall he'll order the U.S. military to do it.\n\nIn one of a string of Twitter comments, the U.S. leader said, \"People do not realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built.\"\n\nHe said that \"large Caravans\" of migrants - several thousand people from Central American nations trying to escape poverty and violence in their homelands - had been blocked from entering the United States because of \"our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls & Fences, or Border Patrol Officers & Military . They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries.\"\n\nTrump declared, \"Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.\" But he said, \"A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution.\"\n\n\n\nTrump vowed during his 2016 run for the White House to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. As president, however, Trump has sought U.S. taxpayer funding for it, but been thwarted by Congress, where Republican colleagues of Trump have mixed views on it and Democrats are uniformly opposed to it.\n\nTrump wants $5 billion included in the 2019 budget as a start toward funding the wall, which could cost $20 billion or more. But Democrats have offered no more than $1.6 billion for more border security, not specifically for the wall.\n\nTrump is discussing wall funding Tuesday at the White House with the top two Democratic leaders, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, now the House minority leader who is likely to become House Speaker next month when Democrats take control of the House of Representatives after picking up 40 seats in the nationwide congressional elections in early November.\n\nTrump said Democrats \"were right\" to vote for a wall in 2006, but that construction was for a less-ambitious fencing plan than Trump wants for a wall that could be more than 15 meters tall.\n\n\"Today, they no longer want Border Security,\" Trump said of Democrats. \"They will fight it at all cost.\"\n\nIn a joint statement Monday, Schumer and Pelosi said, \"This holiday season, the president knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House and Senate, and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement\" to fund several agencies past Dec. 21 to avert a partial government shutdown.\n\nLast week, Pelosi called the wall \"immoral, ineffective and expensive.\"\n\nAbout three-fourths of federal government operations have already been funded through next September, but the Department of Homeland Security, which would include wall funding, is not among the agencies yet with an approved 2019 funding plan.\n\nDebate over the spending marks the final legislative action of the Republican-controlled Congress and a must-pass bill to avert a partial government shutdown ahead of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.\n\nTrump's meeting with Schumer and Pelosi will be the first test of the president's ability to negotiate bipartisan deals following the Democratic takeover of the House that takes effect in early January.\n\nTrump and Pelosi initially expressed interest in working with each other on bills addressing infrastructure and prescription drug prices. But Pelosi rejected the possibility of compromise on border wall funding.\n\nTrump says the border wall with Mexico will stop an invasion of migrants from Central America into the United States.\n\n\"Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country loses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months.

Prosecutors revealed that a Russian contacted Cohen in 2015 and offered \"political synergy\" between Russia and the Republican campaign. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that that person is a former Russian Olympic athlete named Dmitry Klokov.\n\n\n\nTrump and his lawyers have returned a list of written answers on the collusion question to Mueller, but it's unclear whether investigators will return with more questions.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Did the president obstruct the investigation?\n\n\n\nThat is another unresolved question that Mueller is pursuing. Investigators have examined key episodes such as Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his fury over the recusal from the investigation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\n\n\nThe American Defendants\n\n\n\n\u2014 Paul Manafort: He has been convicted in Washington and Virginia of crimes related to years of Ukrainian political consulting work, including allegations he concealed his foreign government work from the United States and failed to pay taxes on it. Although the charges don't directly touch Trump, he's nonetheless remained a figure of considerable intrigue and enjoys the continued sympathy of the president, who has left open the door for a pardon.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rick Gates: The longtime associate of Manafort and key Trump campaign aide was indicted last year alongside his mentor but months later split from him by pleading guilty to unregistered foreign lobbying work and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller. No sentencing date has been scheduled for Gates, indicating that his cooperation with investigators is continuing.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Flynn: He has admitted lying to the FBI just days after Trump took office by telling agents that he had never discussed sanctions with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States. The White House said Flynn had misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the conversation and ousted him weeks later. He's since become a vital cooperator for Mueller, having met 19 times with investigators. Prosecutors aren't recommending any prison time when he's sentenced next week.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Michael Cohen: He's at the center of not only Mueller's investigation but also a separate investigation into hush-money payments. In Mueller's investigation, Cohen has admitted lying to Congress about a proposed real estate development in Moscow. He told lawmakers the negotiations were done in January 2016 when in fact they stretched deep into the campaign. He also pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations stemming from the payments, with prosecutors saying he ``acted in coordination and at the direction of Individual-1'' \u2014 Trump.\n\n\n\n\u2014 George Papadopoulos: The former foreign policy adviser recently finished a 14-day prison sentence after admitting lying to the FBI about a 2016 conversation with a Maltese professor who told him Russia had \"dirt\" on Clinton in the form of emails.\n\n25 Russians\n\n\n\n\u2014 Twelve military intelligence officers were charged in July with hacking the email accounts of Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and then facilitating the release of tens of thousands of private communications. It remains perhaps the most direct example of what American intelligence officials say was a broad conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf.\n\n\n\nThat indictment did not accuse any Americans of participating in the conspiracy, though it did include an eye-catching detail: The Russian hackers, prosecutors say, made an attempt to break into Clinton's network just hours after Trump appeared to invite them to do so. In a July 27, 2016, speech, Trump urged Russia to look for emails that Clinton said she had deleted from her tenure as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\"Russia, if you're listening,\" Trump said, \"I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014 A separate indictment charges 13 Russians with using a covert social media propaganda campaign to sow discord among Americans in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors say the scheme was run by a Russia-based troll farm that relied on bogus social media postings and advertisements fraudulently purchased in the name of Americans to try to influence the election.\n\n\n\nOther Defendants\n\n\n\n\u2014 Konstantin Kilimnik: The Ukrainian native, who U.S. authorities say has ties to Russian intelligence, was indicted on obstruction of justice charges involving Manafort. The men are accused of trying to persuade two witnesses to lie about the nature of political consulting and lobbying work they carried out for Ukrainian interests.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Richard Pinedo: The California man was sentenced in October to six months in prison for unwittingly aiding the Russian troll farm by selling stolen identifications and bank account numbers that were used by Russians to establish PayPal accounts and purchase advertisements on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Alex van der Zwaan: The Dutch attorney became the first person punished with prison in the Mueller investigation when he was given a monthlong sentence for lying to investigators about his contacts with Gates and Kilimnik and about a report prepared by his law firm about the trial of a former Ukrainian prime minister.\n\n\n\nOther Names You May Have Heard\n\n\n\n\u2014 Roger Stone: The longtime Trump confidant and self-proclaimed \"dirty trickster\" of Republican politics has been under investigation for months as prosecutors try to establish what knowledge he may have had about plans by WikiLeaks to release the stolen Democratic emails in the weeks before the election. Although a 2016 Stone tweet \u2014 \"Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel\" \u2014 appeared to presage the disclosure of hacked emails, Stone has said he had no inside knowledge about the content, source or timing of WikiLeaks' disclosure.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Jerome Corsi: A conspiracy theorist and Stone friend, he's been under intense pressure from Mueller and even turned down a plea offer that would have required him to admit intentionally lying about a 2016 conversation he had with Stone about WikiLeaks. It's unclear when or if he will be indicted, but based on draft documents Corsi has released, prosecutors appear to believe that he misled them about email exchanges involving Assange and the purloined emails.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Julian Assange: Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia inadvertently disclosed the existence of a sealed criminal complaint against the WikiLeaks founder, though no details have been publicly announced. Assange, under Justice Department scrutiny for years for WikiLeaks' role in publishing government secrets, has been an important figure in the Mueller probe as investigators examine how WikiLeaks obtained the stolen emails and whether any Americans were involved in coordinating that effort.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Donald Trump Jr.: The president's eldest son has attracted scrutiny for his role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 \u2014 also attended by Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 at which he expected to receive damaging information on Clinton. He has said the meeting was a waste of time because he didn't receive anything interesting from the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya.

If China cracks down on this \u2018horror drug,\u2019 using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!\u201d Trump tweeted last week.\n\nChina is the biggest source of illicit fentanyl-like substances in the United States and their flows have persisted in recent years through China\u2019s vast, but poorly monitored and weakly regulated chemical and pharmaceutical industries, according to a report released last month by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nMaking matters worse, Beijing schedules reviews of chemicals one by one \u2013 a slow and ineffective procedure, which allows room for illicit manufacturers to create new substances faster than they can be controlled, the report added.\n\nIn other words, even though China has banned nearly 40 new fentanyl-like substances after years of pressure from U.S. officials, opioid chemists can still concoct new narcotics to get around customs blacklists.\n\nAn uphill battle\n\nThat has turned Sino-U.S. counter-narcotic cooperation into an uphill battle.\n\nAn industry watcher in Beijing, who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity, said concocting new clones to skirt the ban is easy and quick.\n\n\"China may not necessarily be the major source of [fentanyl] flows to the U.S. [Flows from China] may not outsize those from Latin American countries because any [opioid chemist] is capable of making it. Those in the U.S. may be able to easily produce it in their own garages,\" the industry watcher said.\n\nA more efficient way to combat the illicit drug would be for both countries to impose a \"white list\" of fentanyl substances so that most illicit fentanyl derivatives on the list would be systemically banned, he said.\n\nFor example, the industry watcher added, only licensed pharmaceuticals would be allowed to manufacture an approved list of fentanyl-related substances for medical use, which would make it easy for Chinese authorities to monitor their flows given that China\u2019s regulation of the pharmaceutical industry is stricter than the chemical industry.\n\nAddressing regulatory loopholes\n\nThe United States, for its part, is urging Beijing to consider establishing fentanyl as its own class of controlled substances so that all known and future fentanyl analogues are automatically controlled in China.\n\nOr China should commit to targeting U.S.-bound exports of substances controlled in the United States, but not in China, as such all substances controlled by U.S. regulators would also be automatically illegal in China, according to the review commission.\n\nBut Ming Xia, a professor of political science and global affairs at City University of New York, doubted if incentives are strong enough for China to fight the United State\u2019s fentanyl war unless the controlled substances become a lethal addiction among its own youth.\n\n\u201cFor now, China only gains from its chemical exports, but no cost to pay for. China may consider the abuse of such chemical exports none of its business. Therefore, China may not be strongly motivated to contain its [fentanyl] exports,\u201d Xia said.\n\nThe New York-based professor, however, urged China to take the drug war seriously because its own young people may one day become addicted.\n\nHe also urges the United States to strengthen its oversight on the flow of the controlled substance and cut down its huge dependence on painkillers, which makes it a natural destination of opioid imports in great quantities with an increased potential for overdose or abuse.\n\nNo comment\n\nSince the G-20 meeting, China hasn\u2019t yet announced any concrete measures or policy reforms to tackle existing legal loopholes and improve regulatory efficiency or oversight of chemical productions.\n\nTougher restrictions on chemical exports are believed to have a negative impact on China\u2019s future economic growth.\n\nGiven the issue\u2019s sensitivity, two narcotics experts in Beijing with the People\u2019s Public Security University of China have declined VOA\u2019s requests for comments.\n\nChina, however, is cooperating with U.S. law enforcement agencies in their efforts to take legal actions against known Chinese drug traffickers.\n\nA group of 21 people recently pleaded guilty in a court in Xingtai, Hebei, over their illicit trade of drugs, including fentanyl by courier or post to countries such as the United States and Canada."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "US Denies Climate Change, Promotes Fossil Fuel Energy During UN Conference", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4695452.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "A U.S. energy official says \u201cno country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability\u201d during a U.N. climate discussions in Poland.

After weeks of refusing to budge on plans to hold a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, Theresa May let slip to staff that maybe, just maybe, there could be movement.\n\nOn Sunday, the clamour from key cabinet ministers for a postponement grew louder. When she rang Irish PM Leo Varadkar and the EU\u2019s Donald Tusk, May still insisted she was pressing on with the vote planned for Tuesday. But they were told it would be easier to sell the deal to her MPs if she had some extra assurances on the vexed issue of Northern Ireland. Once more, the idea of Britain pleading for more time became palpable.\n\nAnd yet even if Brussels smelled doubt and could feel the timetable slipping, some around her felt that May still wanted to stick to Tuesday. As he was briefed on how to handle the breakfast media on Monday morning, Michael Gove was certainly convinced the famously stubborn PM was not for turning. In a pool clip for TV, he said not once but three times that the vote would go ahead as planned.\n\nWithin minutes of Gove\u2019s broadcast round ending, cabinet were told to expect an emergency conference call. The ministers who had been pushing for a delay knew at that point they had won. When the call was made, at 11.30am, there was no dissent.\n\nOstensibly, the cabinet was being \u2018consulted\u2019 but in fact Chief Whip Julian Smith and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson were among eight ministers who had driven the postponement. The PM had been left with little choice. Unsurprisingly, the news was leaked within seconds.\n\nWhen May got up in the Commons to confirm the news, there was a mix of derision and laughter from Opposition benches - and stony silence from the Tory benches behind her. \u201cOn one issue, the Northern Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern\u2026\u201d she admitted.\n\nThe House was packed tighter than a Budget Day, with cabinet ministers David Gauke, Chris Grayling, Damian Hinds, Jeremy Wright, Karen Bradley forced to stand.

Please, Prime Minister, really do start to listen and come back with changes to the withdrawal agreement, or it will be voted down.\u201d\n\nAs Dodds spoke, Gavin Williamson, who had also entered the chamber late behind the Speaker\u2019s chair, was looking avidly at his smartphone. It was apt that he was operating literally behind the scenes, because in many ways it has been Williamson - the former Chief Whip who hammered out the DUP-Tory alliance in the days after the snap election disaster - who has quietly tried to save the PM from herself in recent weeks.\n\nFor some Tory backbenchers, the most telling vignette came on the night of November 19. The DUP had just fired a \u2018warning shot\u2019 across the bows of the government by voting with Labour and against the Tories on the Budget.\n\nIn the wood-panelled Members\u2019 Dining Room overlooking the Thames, Williamson decided to sit with DUP MPs and chat to his old friends to rebuild bridges, despite their apparent break with the confidence and supply agreement that props May up in power.\n\nYet when Chief Whip Julian Smith happened to arrive in the same room, he acknowledged his colleague but blanked the entire DUP gathering.

He gets their concerns, they have contempt for Bradley and for their official handlers, Damian Green and then Lidington, aren\u2019t on their wavelength at all. So even if they had been minded to dilute the sell-out, they were in no shape to sell it,\u201d says one who knows the Northern Irish party well.\n\nMoreover, Williamson \u2013 who actually proposed that May should give the DUP ministerial posts in 2016 - has told friends that \u201cburning the DUP is madness\u201d. He sees the danger as a threat to the life of the Parliament, May\u2019s main weapon with the vast bulk of Tory MPs, who are indifferent to Brexit either way.\n\nBut most of all it is the Whips\u2019 Office under Smith that is being held responsible for the fiasco of the last few weeks, with its roots starting last year.\n\nHe is being blamed for misreading last summer how dangerous it was to break with precedent and force MPs to abstain on Opposition Day motions. And when Labour started using an ancient procedural device of a \u2018Humble Address\u2019 to force the government to act on key issues like releasing Brexit impact assessments, Smith failed to spot how toxic it would ultimately become.\n\nSmith\u2019s allies point out he\u2019s lost just a handful of votes since taking over in 2017, no mean achievement given the wafer-thin, DUP-backed majority. Still, the \u201963 minutes of May-hem\u2019 last week, in which the Government lost three votes in quick succession, is what critics say confirmed the whips\u2019 failure to carry out their basic duty: \u2018count and then warn\u2019.\n\n\u201cThey should have spotted they were going to lose the Contempt of Parliament motion and pulled that vote and published the Attorney General\u2019s legal advice,\u201d one Tory MP said. \u201cThey got their numbers wrong, badly wrong. If they\u2019d got it right, we wouldn\u2019t be in the mess we are now.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the government whips\u2019 office seemed split on the Dominic Grieve amendment that aimed to give parliament more of a say on Brexit alternatives. One whip confided that they felt as if the chief and his deputy, Chris Pincher, were actually encouraging some MPs to back the Grieve plan, while others were advised by more junior whips to oppose it. \u201cIt\u2019s like they so wanted to scare Brexiteers, they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing,\u201d one of those involved said.\n\nHuffPost Michael Gove was among the ministers to insist the deal would go ahead.\n\nEach junior whip has to tend their \u2018flock\u2019 of MPs, normally split up on a regional basis. But several backbenchers have been surprised that their whips appear to have given up on them, and that the PM showed no interest in meeting them.\n\nPincher, known as \u2018Pinch\u2019 to colleagues, is now getting his own share of the blame. \u201cHe\u2019s got no relationship with the DUP and has no idea about policy. The best whips know the policy and the numbers, these guys know neither,\u201d one particularly furious rebel said. \u201cJulian is so often at No.10, it\u2019s Pinch who is the one over here [in the Commons]. And it ain\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nWith the big Brexit vote now expected to be delayed until January, one MP ridiculed the recent whips\u2019 empty threat to make parliament sit longer to eat into their festive break. \u201cIt\u2019s the Pinch who stole Christmas! He can\u2019t count so he\u2019s lucky there\u2019s an advent calendar to help tell him which day is which.\u201d Others point out that Pincher earns the same salary as the Chief Whip [\u00a3109,000]. \u201cIf the PM needs a scalp, surely it\u2019s his that\u2019s for the taking?\u201d\n\nOne grandee said that the most telling incident in recent days was that many MPs had gone to Williamson rather than Smith to pass on their concerns that the party would split if May went ahead with the vote. And Cabinet ministers relate that Smith has gone from reassuring the PM that she had \u2018the numbers\u2019 to becoming one of those warning postponement was vital to protecting the Government.\n\nWhat still rankles for many on the Labour side is the way Smith personally ordered Tory MPs to break their \u2018pair\u2019 with Opposition MPs to win a vote on the Trade Bill this summer. Party chairman Brandon Lewis was told to vote even though he paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who had only recently given birth.\n\nOpposition whips are reluctant to criticise their opposite numbers and in many ways sympathise, though not for long.\n\n\u201cWhips always get the blame when things go wrong but rarely get the credit when things go right,\u201d one said. \u201cBut the government\u2019s big mistake is trying to build relationships with MPs only at times of trouble.\u201d Labour also sees the Smith set-up as very hierarchical, with junior whips unable to be trusted with delegation. Every decision goes through \u2018The Chief\u2019, as he is known.\n\nMost puzzling to Labour has been the total absence of any attempt by either the whips or No.10 to engage with MPs in Leave seats who could possibly be tempted to back May\u2019s deal as at least a way of delivering the 2016 referendum. MPs like Lisa Nandy had no contact at all.\n\nPA Wire/PA Images DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds\n\nOthers on the Tory side point out that the entire government whips\u2019 office lacks experienced, older hands needed to calm nerves in what is increasingly feeling like a minority government. As the ConservativeHome website has pointed out, Smith and Pincher and their loyal colleague Mark Spencer have been in post just two-and-a-half years, and the rest of their team on average just 18 months. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t any grown ups,\u201d one rebel says.\n\nTo make things worse, May has removed some of the better rated whips out into ministerial office. Former ministers who have sent warning shots in various votes have been ignored. Those with experience of Northern Ireland have not been approached for advice on handling the DUP either.\n\nDefenders of the whips say they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for what are ultimately Downing Street\u2019s tactical and strategical errors. Triggering Article 50 too early, ramping up expectation of a hard Brexit, triggering a doomed snap election, misreading the DUP a year ago, and even creating a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 are all blunders laid at the door of May and her top team.\n\nOne loyalist MP also pointed out that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his European Research Group allies had proved even worse \u2018counters\u2019 than the whips, not least when it comes to the 48 signatures needed for a vote of confidence. Yet the ERG has in fact deployed a disciplined whipping operation when its votes are needed to send a message to the PM, a former minister said.\n\nOthers sympathise that this set of whips is facing a group of hardened Brexiteer rebels who have learned from the Maastricht rebellions under John Major in the 1990s. Crucially, they have built an almost impregnable alliance with the DUP.\n\nIronically portraits of some of May\u2019s strongest critics, like David Davis and Michael Fallon, stare down from the Cabinet Office walls near No.9 Downing Street, official home of the Chief Whip. Both Davis and Fallon were whips themselves, and know all the tricks of the trade.\n\nOne incident last week highlighted the inadequacies in the current set-up. When \u2018independent\u2019 backbenchers tabled an amendment to give Parliament more of a say over the \u2018backstop\u2019, a trio of Hugo Swire, Bob Neill and Richard Graham were all keen to stress it was one way to prod the Government into assuaging Brexiteers\u2019 fears.\n\nHowever, the semblance of independence was blown when Pincher allowed himself to be spotted in the Commons Table Office, literally signing an extra name to the amendment. The fiction that this was anything other than a Government ploy was swiftly exposed.\n\nOne Tory had Pincher on the phone asking him to \u2018consider\u2019 signing the Swire amendment. When told it wouldn\u2019t solve deeper problems, the Deputy Chief Whip said he wanted names \u201ceven if you don\u2019t like it because we want to make sure the Speaker selects it.\u201d It was also pointed out that the motion was vital to showing the broader views of the Commons, as a counterbalance to the Hilary Benn motion (opposing \u2018no deal\u2019), if both should be passed.\n\nITV News was granted rare access to the Chief Whip's office, as he tries to rally support for the PM's Brexit deal ahead of Tuesday's vote.\n\nWe caught the argument as vocal Brexiteer Philip Davies insisted he was voting 'no' https://t.co/KHDQTdnQtA pic.twitter.com/MJjE7vdaXb \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) December 6, 2018\n\nSmith\u2019s decision to allow in the ITV News cameras to follow his efforts to win round MPs was also seen as woefully na\u00efve, given he later had to tell the PM he just couldn\u2019t win the vote. No.10 found out about the plan a week after the filming started, one source confided.\n\nOn Monday evening, the chaotic nature of this \u2018zombie\u2019 government on its most shambolic day yet was underlined with yet more ridicule. In line with convention, a junior whip tried to shout \u2018tomorrow!\u2019 to formally defer the Brexit vote to an unspecified date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common in the House to say \u2018tomorrow\u2019, this allow the Government to bring back a debate on a date of its choosing. This does not mean the debate will continue tomorrow,\u201d a No.10 source said.\n\nThe move worked, but it left a sour taste in the mouth of both Tory Brexiteers and Labour MPs. Veteran Conservative Peter Bone complained that he wanted Parliament to decide its own timetable, Labour wags heckled \u2018manana!\u2019\n\nLabour\u2019s Helen Goodman channelled Macbeth. \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day ..will it also be to the last syllable of recorded time?\u201d With Tory leadership contenders all gearing up for a Shakesperean contest of thwarted and unsated ambition, all eyes are indeed on the few days and weeks ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018The Chief\u2019 likes to joke to colleagues that he\u2019s had to deal with more sex scandals and reshuffles (nine in total) than he\u2019d bargained for. He has also told them his five-year-old is thoroughly sick of hearing the word \u2018backstop\u2019 at home. But so too are Tory and DUP MPs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Mexico To Invest $30 Billion To Boost Growth, Stem Migration", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-to-invest-30-billion-to-boost-growth-stem-migration_us_5c0fa8c7e4b08bcb27ec82a2", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Mexico will invest more than $30 billion in its poor southern states over the next five years, the foreign minister said on Monday, boosting the region economically as part of efforts to curb migration.\n\nUnder pressure from the United States, Mexico is grappling to halt the northward flow of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.\n\nForeign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a United Nations-backed conference on migration in Marrakech that the investment would accompany a broad policy shift he expected would stem migration better than \u201ccontainment measures.\u201d\n\nHe did not detail what policies Mexico may change, or exactly how the $30 billion investment will be funded and deployed.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to a migrant today in our nation is a disgrace,\u201d he said, seated beside counterparts from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who have pledged to work together on regional development.\n\n\u201cMexico can\u2019t let this happen anymore.\u201d\n\nSeveral thousand people set off on foot in a caravan from Honduras in October, enduring hot sun and rain on the long route in hopes of reaching the United States.\n\nRoughly 6,000 made it to Mexico\u2019s northern border city of Tijuana, many encountering hostility from locals and dirty conditions at crowded shelters.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, is pushing for U.S. support to fight poverty and crime in Central America that prompt thousands of people to abandon their homes every year and risk the journey north.\n\nHe says his plans for major infrastructure projects, including a refinery and two railways, will provide jobs to both Mexicans and Central Americans.\n\nEbrard previously said Mexico was likely to invest more than $20 billion in southern Mexico, and that El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras should each match that sum.\n\nOn Monday, he added that the three countries just south of Mexico had finished an initial \u201cdiagnostic\u201d and were expected to present their priority projects at the beginning of 2019."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "U.S. Military Ends Search For 5 Missing Marines After Crash Off Japan Coast", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/search-for-5-missing-marines-ends_us_5c0f5792e4b0edf5a3a80a08", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "TOKYO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. military ended a search on Tuesday for five Marines missing in the sea off Japan since two Marine Corps aircraft were involved in an accident during an air-to-air refueling exercise on Dec. 6.\n\nThe five missing crew of a KC-130 Hercules refueling plane were officially declared deceased.\n\n\u201cWe know this difficult decision was made after all resources were exhausted in the vigorous search for our Marines,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell Maury, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 (USMC) Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron, said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts are heavy and our prayers are with all family and friends of all five aircrew.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Marines disappeared on Dec. 6 after an accident during an air-to-air refueling exercise.\n\nTwo marine pilots flying an F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter and the five crew members onboard the KC-130 Hercules went missing in waters about 200 miles off the Japanese coast following what U.S. officials have said may have been a mid-air collision.\n\nOne of the two Hornet pilots found by search and rescue teams died.

Last week, he informed White House officials that a vote on the bill was \u201cunlikely\u201d before the end of the year.\n\nPassing the criminal justice legislation before the end of December will require significant cooperation. Any one senator has the right to object and delay the several procedural hurdles necessary to get the bill to the president\u2019s desk. The task may take as little as three days or as long as a week, depending on whether opponents of the bill like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) choose to gum up the works.\n\n\u201cUnless we approach all this work in a highly collaborative, productive way and take real advantage of unanimous consent to expedite proceedings, it is virtually certain that the Senate will need to be in session between Christmas and New Year\u2019s in order to complete this work,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that he would add the First Step Act to the Senate's schedule for December.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to pass the prison reform legislation before the end of the year, the bill\u2019s proponents have said, because Democrats will take over the House in 2019 and won\u2019t necessarily support the current version of the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the end of a Congress. The alignment is changing. The bill that can be passed now \u2015 who knows whether the same bill will be at the same place six months from now,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), one of the bill\u2019s backers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bill that\u2019s good enough, let\u2019s get it done rather than going back to square zero and taking the risk that the president changes his mind, that the House majority won\u2019t accept the same deal, and that this majority won\u2019t accept the same deal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill picked up serious momentum in the last week as several prominent tough-on-crime conservatives endorsed it, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and David Perdue of Georgia. Fox Broadcasting Co. also issued a statement in support of the package.\n\nThe bill\u2019s supporters have said it could easily pass the Senate if only McConnell would allow a vote.\n\nA version of the legislation passed the House earlier this year with a 360-59 vote. The core of the bill is a new pre-release custody program that would give federal prison officials more discretion to release inmates who they believe have a low risk of committing future crimes.

The 2017 numbers increased 2.8 percent from 2016, and topped the previous yearly peak of 39,595 set in 1993 at the height of a U.S. epidemic of firearm-related murder and suicide. The 2017 rate of 12.2 firearm deaths per 100,000 people was the highest since 1996, when it was 12.8 per 100,000.\n\nThe 2017 increase in gun deaths was driven largely by rising suicides, which reached a total of 23,854, or around 60 percent of all gun deaths. Following years of relative stability, the rate of firearm suicides has grown steadily since 2007, especially among men \u2015 predominantly white men.\n\nAlthough gun homicides have fluctuated somewhat in recent years, firearm-related slayings rose slightly last year, reaching 14,542 \u2015 also the highest annual total since the 1990s.\n\nThe numbers came amid a year of bloody massacres, including the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a country music festival in Las Vegas. But the majority of the year\u2019s firearm deaths reflect a more routine form of gun violence, which has taken a disproportionate toll on poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.\n\nBlack men accounted for more than half of gun homicide victims in 2017, despite making up less than 7 percent of the population, according to an analysis by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety organization founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D).\n\nThe new data also shows that 2017 was the third straight year in which gun deaths outpaced traffic fatalities. It was also the first year that firearm-related deaths surpassed car crash deaths by more than 1,000, according to Giffords.\n\nTroubling as the CDC report is, it says nothing of the tens of thousands of people who each year survive gunshots. CDC data has been less reliable on nonfatal gunshot injuries, and recent reporting has called into question government estimates of a precipitous rise in nonfatal wounds in recent years.\n\nStill, the new CDC figures show why so many Americans are rallying around the cause of gun violence prevention, as demonstrated by midterm election victories by candidates favoring gun reform, Giffords said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amoeba From Tap Water In Neti Pot Tied To Fatal Brain Infection In Seattle Woman", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tap-water-neti-pot-fatal-brain-infection_us_5c0ee93fe4b0edf5a3a7ca4d", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "A fatal brain infection reportedly took the life a Seattle woman who doctors believe improperly used a neti pot.\n\nThe 69-year-old woman, whom health officials are not identifying due to medical privacy regulations, had been suffering from a chronic sinus infection, according to a report published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Infections are rare, but it can cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) of the brain, which is almost always fatal.\n\nThe woman was treated with a combination of drugs but nevertheless fell comatose and her family eventually decided to withdraw life support.\n\nHealth officials reportedly found evidence the woman had been treating her sinus infection for about a year using a neti pot that she was filling with tap water poured through a store-bought water filter.\n\nNeti pots are small vessels that are used to flush the sinuses.

This menu comes from the United Nations climate talks taking place in Poland this month \u2015 a series of discussions aimed at coming up with solutions for saving the planet.\n\nWith multiple warnings from scientists in the past few weeks about the climate effects of eating meat and our need to reduce overconsumption, the menu for delegates was quickly criticized as hypocritical.\n\nMeat and dairy production represents 14.5 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Unless we cut back on our overconsumption of meat in rich countries, it will be almost impossible, climate analysts say, to prevent global warming from bringing temperatures up by a dangerous 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\u201cThe meat-laden menu at COP24 is an insult to the work of the conference,\u201d said Stephanie Feldstein, director of the population and sustainability program at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be serving up cheeseburgers at climate conferences if we\u2019re going to have an honest conversation about the role of food in the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nBetween 2010 and 2050, global meat and dairy consumption is on course to increase by nearly 70 percent, according to data published by the World Resources Institute. Shifting the diets of higher-income consumers toward plant-based foods is vital, climate researchers say, to prevent runaway climate change.\n\nI kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day. Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green\n\nIf the U.N. conference organizers had replaced the beef burgers with plant-based ones, it would have cut the climate emissions associated with each burger by 82 percent, campaigners pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhile meat doesn\u2019t need to be entirely eliminated from global diets in order to meet climate goals, the conference menu should reflect the way forward, which means mostly plant-based dishes and smaller portions of meat and dairy when they are used,\u201d Feldstein said. \u201cMeat and dairy can no longer be the default.\u201d\n\nIt was only in October that the U.N.\u2019s own climate advisers listed dietary changes as an effective strategy for tackling climate change. But delegates and campaigners say food is still treated as an afterthought in U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cComing from civil society in Sweden, where vegetarian food is the norm in most NGOs no matter their focus, I think it is shocking,\u201d said Lotta Velin, Sweden\u2019s youth delegate to the U.N. climate talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hugely surprised that the menu at COP24 is meat- and dairy-heavy, but it sends a strange and unhelpful message nonetheless,\u201d said Mia MacDonald, executive director of Brighter Green, a public policy organization. \u201cAt the Paris climate talks it was really hard to eat as a vegan. I kept asking myself, what\u2019s Al Gore eating? Turns out he took a packed lunch with him from his hotel each day!\u201d\n\nMacDonald said the big and \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d issue is not the meaty menu at the U.N. talks, but the lack of concrete policies to reduce emissions from livestock production and consumption and the failure to promote more plant-based alternatives.\n\nThat lack of progress is because governments are wary of trying to tell people what to eat, says Richard Waite, a food specialist at WRI. \u201cThere\u2019s been more attention about how to mitigate the impact on agriculture, but not dietary change and consumers. So even though awareness of diet and climate link is growing, there is still this cognitive dissonance,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat can make a difference for now, WRI says, is encouraging more companies and restaurants to improve the availability of plant-based alternatives.\n\nU.S. retail sales of plant-based meats have risen 17 percent over the past year, with 39 percent of American consumers working to incorporate more plant-based foods in their diets. The catering company Sodexo has launched 200 plant-based and plant-rich recipes in the U.S. The fast-food chain Max Burgers has set a goal that by 2022, half of all meals it sells at its 120 restaurants worldwide will be made of foods other than beef.\n\n\u201cIn the future, a lot of progress will depend on whether we really have substitutes that are close to the experience of meat and cheaper,\u201d said Tim Searchinger, a lecturer at Princeton University and fellow at WRI. \u201cAnd we are seeing that with the enormously tastier plant-based burgers coming on the market. Over time, they are going to be cheaper. In the long run, a lot of these things will be determined by availability and price.\u201d\n\nThis story has been amended to correct an earlier mistranscription of Waite\u2019s comments.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "SNL's Vanessa Bayer Talks Battling Leukemia And Her Epic End-Of-Chemo Party", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vanessa-bayer-leukemia_us_5c0d5d80e4b035a7bf5c4903", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Monica Schipper via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer attends the premiere of the Netflix film \"Ibiza\" last May in New York.\n\nVanessa Bayer is eternally cheerful \u2015 even when she\u2019s talking about her battle with blood cancer.\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star, who left the show in 2017 after seven seasons of Rachel Green impressions and Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy sketches, recently spoke with HuffPost about having leukemia as a teenager and her new partnership with Gift of Life \u2015 a bone marrow registry dedicated to fighting blood cancer.\n\nSomehow Bayer \u2015 known for her megawatt smile \u2015 manages to make talking about her battle with blood cancer like just another thing that happens to anyone \u2014 like something as simple as getting stitches or a cast for a broken bone.\n\nAside from opening up about defeating cancer, the 37-year-old comedian also spoke about her epic end-of-chemo party that got busted by the police, Pete Davidson ruling the headlines this summer and, of course, performing that infamous \u201cPorn Stars\u201d sketch with Donald Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer, Donald Trump and Cecily Strong during the Nov. 7, 2015, \"Porn Stars\" sketch on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHow did you get involved with Gift of Life?\n\nThey came to me.

I think they took a sample \u2015 biopsied my bone marrow or something \u2015 and saw that I had it. Again, I was 15 and it\u2019s a long treatment but it\u2019s curable right now. I was very lucky.\n\nWhat was it like to hear that you had cancer? Who was in the room with you?\n\nI feel like my parents were in the room with me \u2015 it was such a long time ago. It was definitely a scary thing, but I had a lot of support from my family and I was always very optimistic in general. I always felt like I was on a path to recovery.\n\nWhat would you say to someone who\u2019s scared to sign up for the registry?\n\nI understand, but it\u2019s actually not a scary thing at all. Basically, the way that the process works is that you get swabbed and if you find out that you\u2019re a match you do something that\u2019s similar to giving plasma or platelets, basically blood is drawn.\n\nThey take the stem cells out of it and then they give you back the blood. It\u2019s nothing scary, it\u2019s nothing crazy. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest misconceptions \u2015 that giving stem cells or giving bone marrow is this scary thing and it\u2019s not.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Bayer talking about battling blood cancer on the \"Today\" show on Nov. 30.\n\nSometimes people don\u2019t know what to say when someone has cancer. What would you want them to know?\n\nI think the most important thing with someone with cancer or any kind of illness is just to say something. And just remember that it\u2019s the same person and they\u2019re still your friend or your colleague. I think it\u2019s just important to show up for that person.\n\nWhat did you think of someone like Tig Notaro integrating cancer into her comedy?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, she is so funny. I think she was on \u201cConan\u201d when she did that bit where she was like \u201ccancer has made me be so much more present,\u201d and then she was like, looking on her cell phone. I mean, she\u2019s a genius. I think it\u2019s great [she talks about cancer in her work]. It\u2019s kind of like what we were saying before \u2015 if someone has cancer or has something, they\u2019re still the same person. And I think when someone can joke about it, it puts everyone else at ease a little bit.\n\nHow did having leukemia shape your comedy?\n\nIn college I was in this all-female sketch group called Bloomers. But I just think in general in my comedy there were just so many funny and interesting and awkward moments when I was sick. I think that kind of getting through that made me be able to see funny things in all situations.\n\nWhat were some of the awkward moments about getting sick?\n\nWell, I mean anyone who spends a lot of the time in the hospital knows and, by the way, I\u2019m not like \u2015 my comedy isn\u2019t full of poop jokes or anything, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re so monitored on how much, your poop is checked so much. You know, it\u2019s important. Whenever you\u2019re in a hospital setting, they\u2019re always kind of like, \u201cDid you go?\u201d\n\nHow many times were you asked that [did you go]?\n\nI just feel like I was asked it all the time. When you\u2019re in a hospital setting, [Bayer turns to her PR team laughing and says \u201cIs this a great thing for me to be talking about?\u201d] pooping is important. And my best friend Gwen is a nurse and she\u2019s like \u201cYeah, you gotta [ask].\u201d\n\nHow long were you in the hospital?\n\nI was in and out. When I was first there, I was there for a couple weeks, but then I\u2019d have to go in for certain procedures or if something came up I\u2019d have to go back. I had the most intensive treatment for 10 months and then I had what they call maintenance chemo for two more years after that. I think the summer before my senior year of high school is when I finally stopped chemo. And I had an end-of-chemo party.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nIt was so fun. My parents got me a really big cake. I think I had a big sheet cake and I think it said, \u201cHappy End-of-Chemo Vanessa\u201d or something and so many of my friends came and it was so fun. And then my brother was in a band and his band played in our backyard and then the police came \u2019cause they thought that it was like a \u201crager\u201d \u2015 my parents and I were just talking about this over Thanksgiving.\n\nThe police thought we were drinking and we were like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re literally celebrating the end of me having chemo.\u201d My parents said they were going through the trash and trying to find bottles and stuff and [we were like] this couldn\u2019t be a more positive party. We\u2019re literally just celebrating the end of me having chemo.\n\nWhat did the police end up doing?\n\nI think they finally left, but said \u2019cause of the noise my brother\u2019s band had to stop playing.\n\nHow did you balance having cancer with applying for colleges?\n\nWell, I guess \u2015 if you really think about it \u2015 I had a great thing to write a college essay about.\n\nI did think about that. But just the amount of work that goes into applying for school, too.\n\nI guess I was just hyper-focused on school because I wanted to make sure that having this illness wouldn\u2019t affect my future. Especially once the more intense part of my chemo [treatments] were over, I really was so focused on school. It was really a priority for me.\n\nWhat did you go to school for? What did you think you were going to do?\n\nI thought I would maybe be a biology major [at the University of Pennsylvania, where Bayer went] because I thought that I could do medical research and stuff like that. But then everyone was so smart [laughs].\n\nI was in some really intense science classes and I always thought that I wanted to be a medical researcher who was on TV or something, so then I was like, \u201cOh I think I want to be on TV.\u201d So I actually ended up being a communications major, and I was a French major as well because I studied abroad.\n\nHow did you go from college to being on \u201cSNL\u201d about six years later?\n\nI made the transition from biology pretty quickly my freshman year. I did this sketch group, Bloomers, in college and I performed a lot. I also interned one summer at \u201cConan\u201d and I kind of realized that I wanted to pursue comedy when I was in college. I moved to Chicago after school and I started taking classes at Second City and the iO [theater] and The Annoyance [Theater] and stuff.\n\nAnd I saw that you interned at Sesame Street \u2015 what was that like?\n\nIt was over the summer so they weren\u2019t in production, but it was really magical. We got to go to the set once and it was really amazing.\n\nWhat memories do you have from your first and your last day at \u201cSaturday Night Live?\u201d\n\nI remember from my first day just meeting a lot of the other cast and just being so starstruck by them. And just being like okay, I\u2019m going to have to act like this is normal until I think that it\u2019s normal. And then my last day was just so special, I just remember we were being carried off stage and stuff and it was just so amazing.\n\nNBC via Getty Images Vanessa Bayer getting carried off stage after her last \"SNL\" show on May 20, 2017.\n\nWhy did you leave?\n\nI just felt like it was time. I just had this feeling like it\u2019s time for me to go and I knew that the show was in such great hands with Aidy [Bryant] and Kate [McKinnon] and Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney and everybody.\n\nHow do you tell Lorne Michaels that you were leaving?\n\nI think that we had a discussion about it. He\u2019s always been very supportive. So I feel like I can be very honest with him. I felt like we had a very honest conversation about it.\n\nWas it hard to tell the cast that you were leaving? When did you tell them?\n\nI don\u2019t remember it exactly. I feel like everyone was supportive and we\u2019ll miss you, but we understand. It\u2019s a very hectic schedule so it\u2019s like, after seven years, I want to take a nap [laughs].\n\nSpeaking of that, your New York Times \u201cSunday Routine\u201d has a cult following . Why do you think it resonates so much?\n\nYou know, someone else just brought this up to me. That\u2019s really nice. I do think that normally those \u201cSunday Routines\u201d are so busy and I think it just makes you feel bad about yourself. Like, I don\u2019t get up at six a.m. and make breakfast with my kids or whatever and go to, like, spin class. I think it puts people at ease that most of us are just ordering bagels and then spending whatever I said, spending like 10 minutes being mad that it\u2019s not toasted.\n\nAnd [as you mentioned in your NYT piece] it\u2019s such a New York thing to wonder what your doorman thinks of you. What do you think your doorman thinks of you?\n\nWell, in my building now, not to brag, but I have several different doormen. So I could order breakfast and if I wait two hours and order lunch, they don\u2019t know. But you know if I order multiple dinners, they\u2019re gonna know.\n\nWhat do you think most people\u2019s impression of you is? How do you think you come across to fans?\n\nI think most people think I\u2019m just like a stone-cold bitch.\n\nREALLY?\n\nNo [laughs]. I think everyone knows that I smile a lot so they probably think that I\u2019m pretty nice, but again\u2026 [shrugs].\n\nNBC via Getty Images Michael Che and Vanessa Bayer as 'Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy' during \"Weekend Update\" on \"SNL\" on April 15, 2017.\n\nWhat do people \u2015 when they recognize you on the street \u2015 what do they say to you?\n\nSometimes people think they\u2019ve gone to high school with me. But people are generally very nice. A lot of guys mention [my \u201cSNL\u201d character] the Bar Mitzvah Boy and say they can relate to that time in their life. But people are generally very nice or they think they know me from high school. \u2019Cause you know, we wore so many wigs on \u201cSNL,\u201d so they know your face, but they\u2019re just like, \u201cNew Jersey?\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNope.\u201d\n\nIs it weird that people you\u2019ve known for so long, like Pete Davidson, can suddenly be every headline in the news?\n\nYeah, I guess so, although that happens a lot, you know what I mean? I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people that I\u2019ve known that that\u2019s happened to. And that stuff\u2019s always kind of, you know, it has a moment and then it dies down \u2015 thank goodness for them \u2015 \u2019cause it\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt is ever a lot for you when people ask you personal questions, like are you dating?\n\nYeah, I mean it is, but I feel like it sort of comes with the territory. And you know, I never feel like I have to answer everything.\n\nBut you did talk to Drake about JDate [an online dating service for Jewish singles] one time.\n\nYes, Drake did my web series [\u201cSound Advice\u201d], which I did with my brother. And yeah, he was a great sport about it. I mean, I was kind of asking him in character, but apparently he\u2019s not on JDate. Which, missed opportunity, right?\n\nWhat\u2019s your inspiration for the character you play on \u201cSound Advice?\u201d\n\nI feel like my brother and I would always say we wanted \u2015 and we did it with this \u201d[Weekend] Update\u201d writer Pete Schultz \u2015 we always wanted it to be the woman from \u201cMillionaire Matchmaker,\u201d Patti Stanger, and Zach Galifianakis from \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d That was the combo we were always trying to meet. And so once someone said that it seemed like a combo of those two, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve done our job.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Donald Trump on \u201cSNL?\u201d Do you regret working with him at all?\n\nI mean, it was just interesting. It was so weird because he could only do a certain amount of time because he\u2019s running for president. Cecily and I did the ex-porn stars thing with him and I remember he asked me like, \u201cShould I do it?\u201d and I was like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I wanted to do this sketch and we couldn\u2019t believe that he was gonna do it and it was just sort of surreal. We were all sort of like, \u201cWhy is he here?\u201d But also nobody thought that he was gonna win, you know? It was weird, it was crazy.\n\nDid you ever have any interaction with him in the week leading up to his appearance?\n\nNot a ton. Every week is sort of like a blur, but yeah it\u2019s just so crazy that he did that \u2015 that he was on the show. It\u2019s so weird."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Barack Obama Beats Donald Trump In Twitter 2018 Showdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter_us_5c07bb41e4b0fc236111d20b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-11 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Former President Barack Obama features high in Twitter\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and quoted tweets of 2018.\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn\u2019t.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said.

The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed. Google said it would now move up the timing of when it plans to shutter the consumer version of Google Plus, to April from August.\n\nIn October, Google announced that it found a similar security issue with Google Plus. Google found this vulnerability in March but did not report it immediately, waiting seven months to disclose the bug because it had found no evidence that anyone had exploited the problem to obtain user information.

In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture.

More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings.
