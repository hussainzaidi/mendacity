But everything wasn't what it seemed. The DNC later learned the attempt wasn't the work of an adversary, but had come from within.\n\nWhat actually had been detected was a simulation by the Democratic Party of Michigan of the makings of a hack. The state party had failed to let the DNC know about the exercise.\n\nIn theory, the scare, which prompted the DNC to call the FBI, showed that the party's cybersecurity systems were working: A threat was detected, the party worked with cybersecurity and hosting firms to move quickly to neutralize the threat, they contacted authorities and they promptly shared information with regional party officials and the media.\n\nThat last bit, however, is what Democrats have been reckoning with since the extensive hacking of their party and presidential campaign in the lead-up to the 2016 election: If we're hacked, should we tell voters?\n\nBroadly, there appear to be two competing schools of thought on that issue.\n\nOne says to keep the information quiet. Report it to authorities, but don't make it public as it will distract from the message of the campaign.\n\nThe other says to share information about the hack so other campaigns know what to look for, and -- perhaps more significantly -- to put the media and opposition campaigns on notice that if internal campaign correspondence surfaces, it could be the result of a hack.\n\nHackings in California\n\nEarlier this month, it emerged that the campaigns of two Democratic congressional candidates in California had been breached in the lead-up to the state's primary in June.\n\nNeither Dr. Hans Keirstead's nor David Min's campaigns made the details of the hacks public at the time, as they didn't want it to become a distraction, sources from both campaigns told CNN. The details of the breaches emerged only after both candidates lost their primaries.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- a group that was itself hacked by Russian military intelligence in 2016, as outlined in a recent indictment from special counsel Robert Mueller -- wouldn't explicitly say what it advises campaigns to do after a hack.\n\nIt pointed out that it doesn't have control of individual campaigns, but a committee aide said cyber and legal experts the committee had spoken with warned that discussing the details of individual cyber threats increases the threat.\n\nSources familiar with the Keirstead and Min campaigns said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee didn't advise them one way or the other on going public about being hacked. All said the committee was helpful in helping improve their campaigns' cybersecurity after they reported the breaches.\n\n\"Every campaign has to make an individual choice about whether to make information about a hack public,\" Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager, told CNN. \"But the last thing any campaign should want is a bunch of compromising information released to the public without the proper context that it was stolen -- perhaps by a hostile foreign government.\"\n\nDemocrats tried to get ahead of the hacked materials in 2016, but Mook said many found the revelations that it was due to a Russian intelligence operation \"unbelievable at the time.\"\n\nHe said that although he understood why campaigns were reluctant to do anything to distract from their message, \"A story that you got hacked is maybe a one- or two-day story, and buys you time to educate the press about who is behind the attack. Thousands of juicy emails released at regular intervals can be a weeks-long story. The one-day story may protect your message from the weeks-long story.\"\n\nWhen Keirstead's work email, which the candidate sometimes used for campaign correspondence, was hacked, the decision was made to keep it under wraps, a source familiar with the campaign told CNN.\n\n\"The only decision that you take into account is how does this affect your electoral chances,\" the source said.\n\nWhen Min's campaign realized it had been hacked in March, an FBI agent arrived at the campaign's headquarters within 24 hours, according a source familiar with the campaign.\n\nThe source added, \"We didn't want to make anything happen that would interfere with (the FBI investigation) or take away from the focus of the campaign.\"\n\nThe source hinted at another concern that campaigns that are hacked may have in mind: money. A hack could dissuade donors from contributing out of fear their information will be compromised.\n\nThe hack that wasn't\n\nThe DNC said last week's false alarm demonstrated the party is being proactive when it comes to cybersecurity.\n\n\"Despite our misstep and the alarms that were set off, it's most important that all of the security systems in place worked,\" said Brandon Dillon, the chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, the group responsible for the scare.\n\nAnd despite the false alarm, it appears that the threat is very real. The targeting of the Keirstead and Min campaigns was done by actors who have not been made known -- and may not be known to authorities.\n\nMicrosoft announced last week that it had taken control of six websites it said had been created by Russian military intelligence that could have been used to target the US Senate and conservative groups. So far this election cycle, there have been no public disclosures of Republican campaigns suffering a breach.\n\nIn announcing the company's move against the Russian operation, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post, \"We can only keep our democratic societies secure if candidates can run campaigns and voters can go to the polls untainted by foreign cyberattacks.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Britain can unilaterally cancel Brexit process, top EU lawyer says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/oDoY0QUfjPw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) The British government has the power to unilaterally halt the Brexit process, a top European legal adviser has said, delivering a significant boost to campaigners who want the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nIn an opinion prepared for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Strasbourg, the advocate general said the UK could stop the two-year legal countdown invoked under Article 50.\n\nThe UK had argued that the Article 50 notification could only be withdrawn with the agreement of all 27 remaining EU member states.\n\nJudges must now decide whether to accept the advocate general's advice, as they do in most cases.\n\nIf they do, it gives the UK parliament another way in which to force the government's hand.

Scotland's top court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh, had referred it to Strasbourg for a ruling.\n\nThe case was fiercely opposed by the British government, which unsuccessfully argued that the Supreme Court in London should intervene before it went to Europe.\n\nMay told her Cabinet Tuesday that Brexit would not be reversed, a spokesman said. May stressed that the advocate general's findings were not binding on the court.\n\nJolyon Maugham, one of the petitioners in the case, welcomed the advocate general's opinion, urging UK lawmakers to \"search their consciences and act in the best interests of the country.\"\n\n\"The decision is one that the UK can make unilaterally -- without needing the consent of the other Member States. That puts the decision about our future back into the hands of our own elected representatives -- where it belongs,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nConservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general and second referendum supporter, told the BBC the decision by the advocate general was \"clearly significant.\"\n\n\"Of course it doesn't necessarily have to be translated into a judgment, but the opinion of the advocate general is often very influential in forming the opinion of the court and it reinforces something I have to say I personally always thought was probably the case.\"\n\nAsked whether the decision could lead to a second referendum on EU membership, he added: \"It is certainly helpful because it removes one of the arguments which is 'Oh well, they would never allow us to change our minds'.\"\n\nIn his opinion, Sanchez-Bordona said the possibility of the UK unilaterally revoking Article 50 would be subject to \"certain conditions and limits.\" He noted that it must \"respect national constitutional requirements,\" and that would likely mean a vote in the UK parliament.\n\nECJ justices are expected to decide whether to accept the legal advice in the coming weeks. After that, the case will be referred back to the Court of Session in Edinburgh for a final ruling.\n\nThe decision came on the day that Theresa May begins her quest to sell the Brexit deal to lawmakers in the House of Commons.\n\nMPs will spend the next five days debating the deal before a vote next Tuesday, which May is widely expected to lose.\n\nBefore Tuesday's debate begins, May could face another setback, when MPs vote on whether her government should be held in contempt of parliament for failing to publish the full legal advice on her deal."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Israel begins operation to 'expose and thwart' Hezbollah tunnels", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/I5iiWqEAPFk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Jerusalem (CNN) Israel has launched an operation along its northern border with Lebanon to \"expose and thwart cross border tunnels\" which it says have been dug by Hezbollah, the Israeli army said on Tuesday.\n\nHours after announcing the operation, Israel's military said it had begun work to neutralize such a tunnel near the Israeli town of Metula, which sits right along the border.

In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.\n\nIn more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \"beast,\" a \"pac-man\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.\n\nCNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince.\n\n\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\"\n\nThis is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind.\n\nIs there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them\n\nArrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \"pac man\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows\n\nThe exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \"God help us,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo months later, he was dead.\n\nAbdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.\n\n\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \"The guilt is killing me.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSIM cards and financial support\n\nAbdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.\n\nIn almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following.\n\nThe digital offensive, dubbed the \"cyber bees,\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. \"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial $30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.\n\nIn one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\"\n\n\"Brilliant report,\" Khashoggi replies. \"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army\n\nJamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something.\n\nYou know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting.\n\nA month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first $5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up.\n\nBut in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.\n\n\"How did they know?\" asks Khashoggi in a message.\n\n\"There must have been a gap,\" says Abdulaziz.\n\nThree minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \"God help us.\"\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe.\n\nJamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees?\n\nThe family's safety\n\nOmar Alzahrani I began to create groups\n\nI began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap\n\nTens of people must have been involved in this.\n\nCan you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees.\n\n!\n\nOtherwise I will go to prison\n\nJamal Khashoggi God help us.\n\nOmar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning.\n\nJamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective)\n\nDo not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram.\n\nThe 'hack'\n\nAbdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nMarczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.\n\nDanna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said.\n\nOn Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz.\n\nThe lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.\n\nIn a statement to CNN Monday, after the lawsuit was filed, NSO Group said it was \"completely unfounded\" and \"shows no evidence that the company's technology was used\" to hack Abdulaziz's phone. NSO also said its technology helps governments and law enforcement agencies \"fight terrorism and crime in a modern age\" and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government.\n\nThe statement added: \"The lawsuit appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work.\"\n\n\"In addition, products supplied by NSO are operated by the government customer to whom they were supplied, without the involvement of NSO or its employees.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington.\n\n'Tyranny has no logic'\n\nThe fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.\n\nThe messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.\n\n\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \"but tyranny has no logic.\"\n\nSuch discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing\n\nJamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament.\n\nAs Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.\n\n'Message from MBS'\n\nLast May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.\n\nSpeaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job.\n\n\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\" one of them says.\n\nAbdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh.\n\nChillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qahtani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"If Saud al-Qahtani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\" says one other man.\n\nThen they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.\n\nPoignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life.\n\n\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\"\n\nOn October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Florida woman visiting Costa Rica for her birthday has gone missing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/JpLvTDSYX-4/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A 36-year-old US citizen has been reported missing in Costa Rica, according to the country's Judicial Investigation Department.\n\nCarla Stefaniak was last seen in a suburb outside the capital of San Jose, authorities said.\n\nThe last time anyone heard from Stefaniak was Wednesday night, according to her sister-in-law, April Burton.

It marked one of the largest satellite ride-sharing missions ever launched and the most crowded single mission in US history, according to Spaceflight, SpaceX's customer for the launch.\n\nThe mission illustrated the growing demand to launch small satellites, modern devices that some companies hope will empower an array of new businesses \u2014 from internet service to supply chain monitoring.\n\nFor SpaceX, Monday's mission, called SSO-A, marked its 19th launch of 2018, surpassing its previous annual record of 18 launches last year.\n\nIt was also the first time Musk's company attempted to fly one of its rocket boosters for a third time. The booster, covered in black soot from its two prior flights, landed again on a remote controlled platform in the Pacific Ocean after launch, queuing up the rocket to fly for a fourth time.\n\nSpaceX's goal is to drastically reduce the cost of a launch by reusing the hardware, a feat its competitors long thought was impossible or uneconomical.\n\nThe latest version of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, called Block 5, is designed to fly as many as 100 times before retirement, and up to 10 times without significant refurbishment between flights.\n\nThe first-stage booster used for the SSO-A mission flew twice in the past six months \u2014 first on May 11 for the Bangabandhu mission and again August 7 for Merah Putih\n\nSpaceX also tried again Monday to recover the rocket's fairing , the bulging cone at the top of the rocket that shields satellites during launch. Musk has said the fairing costs about $6 million.\n\nThe company has tried on several occasions to guide the fairing, using parachutes, to a soft landing into a giant net hoisted up by a crew boat called Mr. Steven. But it has yet to hit the mark.\n\nMusk said in a tweet Monday that the fairing halves \"missed the net, but touched down softly in the water.\"\n\nExperts have told CNN Business that salt water can damage electronics and components inside the fairing, likely making the part unusable if it hits the ocean. But Musk said SpaceX will attempt to refurbish the nose cone.\n\n\"Plan is to dry them out & launch again,\" he said. \"Nothing wrong with a little swim.\"\n\nSatellite ride sharing\n\nSpaceX's customer for the SSO-A mission, Spaceflight, aims to be a sort of Uber service for space. The company has for years worked as a liaison between small satellite companies and launch providers, looking to put small payloads onto rockets with extra room on board.\n\n\"We started off just selling the excess capacity on whatever launches were out there,\" Spaceflight president Curt Blake told CNN Business in a recent interview. \"Then, we said, 'Wow demand is so big, we should just buy a whole rocket ourselves.' That's how this mission came to be.\"\n\nSSO-A was the first mission Spaceflight has filled a rocket entirely with its small satellite customers. They came from 34 companies and organizations across 17 countries.\n\nThey included Australia-based Fleet Space Technologies, which aims to connect remote devices to the internet via satellite. Two companies \u2014 US-based Capella Space Corporation and Finland's ICEYE \u2014 seek to use advanced radars to track airplanes or ships, even in cloudy weather. A group of middle school students from Florida sent an experimental astrobiology satellite. And an art project, funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, that pays homage to the first African American astronaut, Robert Henry Lawrence Jr., also took flight.\n\nDeploying all 64 satellites safely is tricky business. The devices, which span a variety of shapes and sizes, rode to space affixed to sides of a 20-foot-tall structure, called a payload stack, that was shielded by the Falcon 9's fairing during launch. Once in orbit, the fairing fell away, and the satellites popped off from the payload stack in a carefully orchestrated sequence.\n\nSpaceflight confirmed about seven hours after launch that all 64 satellites were deployed successfully.\n\nCrowded ridesharing missions like this one have been executed before. India's space agency last year shattered a world record by launching 104 small satellites with a single rocket. Another mission from Russia in 2014 deployed 37 satellites.\n\nSmallsats and space debris\n\nThere is a massive backlog of small satellites waiting to get to orbit. And companies including SpaceX and OneWeb are racing to send constellations of thousands of high-speed internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nWhile hitching a ride with larger payloads is considered the cheapest option for getting to space, many nascent rocket companies are promising lightweight rockets that can be mass produced and make cheap, frequent trips to orbit.\n\nOne such company, US-based Rocket Lab, became the first to reach orbit, and has notched two missions so far . Its backlog of customers is so long that CEO Peter Beck told CNN Business the company is \"not constrained by customers right now \u2014 we're only constrained by how quickly we can build rockets.\"\n\nThe massive influx of new satellites into low-Earth orbit poses difficult questions for the space sector, particularly when it comes to orbital debris"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Child killed when football team's bus crashes in Arkansas", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/c8nppUhzHkg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A bus crash early Monday killed one child and injured 45 other people, most of them children, when the driver lost control of the coach on Interstate 30 west of Benton, Arkansas State Police said.\n\nThe charter bus was carrying a youth all-star football team home from a championship game played over the weekend in Dallas.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Much has been written this year about women's anger -- its power and potential, its evolution and necessity. But beneath the analysis, there is the feeling itself: anger, pure and simple. It's what I felt when I read CNN's report about the destruction -- the outrageous, careless, wrongheaded, uneducated, ill-informed, dangerous, willful destruction -- of rape kits.\n\nI have been engaged in the work to bring an end to sexual violence since 2004, the year I started the Joyful Heart Foundation, which aims to heal and empower sexual assault survivors. But in truth, my work goes back even further -- to the moment I learned some of the statistics about sexual assault and domestic violence in preparation for my role on \"Law & Order: SVU.\"\n\nFor example, in the United States, one in three women and one in six men are survivors of sexual violence . One in four women and one in seven men have suffered severe violence from an intimate partner . Those numbers alone almost made my head explode.\n\nI had that feeling again when I first learned about the backlog of untested rape kits in 2009, after a report from Human Rights Watch . I couldn't wrap my mind around it: thousands of rape kits sitting, in some cases rotting, in police storage facilities across the country.\n\nAs Polly Poskin, executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, has said, \"If you've got stacks of physical evidence of a crime, and you're not doing everything you can with the evidence, then you must be making a decision that this isn't a very serious crime.\" Beyond the obvious threat to public safety, beyond the wasted opportunities to both prosecute the guilty and exonerate the wrongly convicted, the backlog sends a devastating and inexcusable message to survivors: You don't matter. What happened to you doesn't matter.\n\nAnd if the backlog wasn't enough, the destruction of rape kits now brings our country's attitude toward sexual assault and its victims into even sharper focus. Explore CNN's investigative report and you will learn about 99 agencies in 47 states destroying rape kits. About a detective in North Carolina who authorized the trashing of a rape kit a month after it was collected from a woman who was gang raped because the investigator didn't believe her. And about records showing kits were trashed as recently as 2016 -- with one of the objectives being to \"make space in the evidence room.\"\n\nThat is an outrageous, shameful level of disregard, and the system that makes it possible must change. Just as the backlog is a reflection of how we regard sexual assault and its victims in this country, the individual actions and decisions by law enforcement are the outcome of deeply entrenched societal attitudes that make those actions and decisions possible. Those attitudes must be dismantled.\n\nAnd what must change are the laws governing the handling of rape kits.\n\nAs CNN reports, last year the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations for best practices about the counting, tracking and testing of rape kits, reforms that the federal government agrees are needed. In order to be able to hold jurisdictions accountable, those recommendations must become law in all 50 states. Legally requiring the testing of rape kits and prohibiting the destruction of rape kits ensures that every survivor gets the same standard of care and rights. Importantly, each survivor should also have the right -- by law -- to know the status of their rape kit and have the option of having it preserved for as long as they want.\n\nIt is important to note that systemic and lasting change takes effect through state-level legislation. While agency, local, and county-level reforms are vital, we know that perpetrators do not stop at the county limits, and survivors' access to justice should not be restricted by zip code.\n\nProgress has already been made, to be sure. In the last two years alone, we and our partners have helped pass 34 laws to change the way rape kits are handled and are already working on legislation for 2019. Through endthebacklog.org , the first and only comprehensive online hub for information about the rape kit backlog in the United States, we are sharing best practices, progress on reform and a way for people to join this growing effort.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI also had the great privilege of telling survivors' stories who have kits in the backlog in \"I Am Evidence,\" the documentary I produced in partnership with HBO, which continues to be shown in communities across the country.\n\nIn the work to bring this violence to an end -- that is the vision to which we must commit -- stark reminders, like this important report from CNN, confront us with how much work is left to be done. While the report's content angers me deeply, perhaps that anger is not pure and simple. It also contains a renewed resolve, a reminder of how much is at stake in our work, and a deepened determination to create the more just society we all seek."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Michael Flynn court filing likely to reveal new details in Russia probe", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/KBt7WDp6fxg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller is set to reveal the extent of Michael Flynn's cooperation and insights into the dealings of Russians with the Trump campaign and administration.\n\nIn the court filing due by midnight Tuesday, Mueller's team could also nod toward the next criminal indictments in its sights.\n\nThe special counsel's office is expected to describe the crimes Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, committed that led to his guilty plea a year ago and how he has helped the Russia probe this year. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators on December 1, 2017. The coming filing is meant to brief a federal judge before Flynn's sentencing.\n\nSimilar filings before other Mueller defendants' sentencings -- former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, Dutch lawyer Alex Van der Zwaan and internet salesman Richard Pinedo -- contained revelations about what each person did and knew in regard to Russians and members of the campaign.\n\nBut none of those defendants cut a deal to cooperate with Mueller like Flynn did. Each earned prison time that ranged from 14 days to six months.\n\nSome of the details in Tuesday's filing could be described under seal, especially if parts of the investigation that Flynn contributed to are not yet public.\n\nLast December, Flynn became the first high-ranking Trump adviser to agree to formally cooperate with the special counsel's probe.\n\nThe details revealed at his plea hearing raised the question of what Trump had known about Flynn's discussions with the Russian government.\n\nThe fruits of what he shared with investigators are not yet known. To this point, none of the people Flynn is said to have lied about has been charged with a crime. But Flynn likely gave Mueller a window into not just the 2016 presidential campaign but also the new administration's dealings with Russians and reactions to the early days of the Russia investigation.\n\nInklings of what prosecutors learned from Flynn and who else on the campaign and transition may still have legal risks could come out in the filing Tuesday.\n\nFlynn's help to Mueller\n\nFlynn agreed to sit for interviews with the special counsel's office as much as needed following his plea. He appears to have done so.\n\nProsecutors delayed his case from moving to sentencing four times over the past year. Almost every time, they cited their reason as \"due to the status of the investigation,\" according to court filings. In mid-September, they said Flynn was ready to be sentenced.\n\nYet that September court filing hit one unusual note: The prosecutors asked the judge to keep a tight schedule on the deadlines for filings, virtually making sure that they and defense team would have to reveal nothing about Flynn's case and cooperation before the midterm elections in November. This further suggests that the information to be revealed by Mueller this week could create a political fire.\n\nIt's typical for cooperators in conspiracy investigations to hang in limbo for months or even years before they are sentenced. That way, prosecutors can continue to tap them for information and call them to testify before grand juries and at trials.\n\nOther defendants in the Mueller probe who've pleaded guilty and signed cooperation agreements have not been sentenced yet, including Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The pair of Trump campaign leaders separately met with the special counsel's office for several hours over multiple days after their pleas.\n\nGates \"continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations,\" the special counsel's office said in a November court filing. Manafort breached his deal by lying during his cooperation interviews, the special counsel's office declared last week, so he will be sentenced in the coming months.\n\nMeet the Mueller team Special counsel Robert Mueller assembled a team of at least 17 lawyers for his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe maximum sentence for Flynn's crime is five years in prison, but his likely sentence will be between zero to six months in prison. If he helped prosecutors significantly, they could even ask the judge to give him no time in prison. Flynn's lawyers will likely argue for that as well.\n\nA critical factor in how much prison time he will get -- if any -- will be how Mueller details the extent of Flynn's assistance in the Russia probe.\n\nFlynn's lies\n\nWhen Flynn was charged, the special counsel's office described how he had lied about passing messages from members of the Trump campaign to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and back again. Those phone calls were about easing sanctions on Russia and influencing foreign governments' votes on a United Nations resolution about Israeli settlements.\n\nSpecifically, Flynn called senior Trump transition team members at Mar-a-Lago in Florida three times in late December 2016 to discuss conversations he was having with Kislyak about sanctions. He then relayed his conversation with Kislyak to transition adviser KT McFarland.\n\nSeparately, according to CNN reporting and his plea documents, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, directed Flynn to contact foreign officials before Trump took office about the UN vote on settlements.\n\nFlynn also pleaded guilty to lying on his foreign lobbying registrations about his work on a lobbying project for Turkey.\n\nHis ties to the Russia probe could reach much further than prosecutors revealed a year ago.\n\nThe former national security adviser was at the center of what's believed to be an investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. Flynn was fired in the early days of the administration after then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates raised with West Wing officials that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications on Russian sanctions. Around that same time, Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to let the Flynn investigation go, Comey has said.\n\nFlynn also served on the campaign, the transition team and in the administration at crucial moments that could still be under investigation related to Russian interference in American politics, making his contact with Kislyak even more significant.\n\nFlynn was the person who informed Trump that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the first to call him after Trump's inauguration, according to Comey.\n\nAnd the Wall Street Journal has outlined Flynn's alleged contacts with the late Peter W. Smith, who sought out the Russian hackers who obtained Clinton campaign emails. It is unclear if Mueller's office is still pursuing Smith's actions during the campaign.\n\nFlynn, a retired lieutenant general, is scheduled to be sentenced by federal Judge Emmet Sullivan on December 18. Next week, his defense team will have a chance to tell its version of the story of his crimes."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller may be poised to lift the lid of his investigation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/QMQVRWk9WY0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) America may get its most intimate look yet inside Robert Mueller's secretive Russia investigation in the next four days, with a series of disclosures that have the potential to be greatly damaging for President Donald Trump.\n\nCourt filings focusing on Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Tuesday and his ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Friday could offer tantalizing new details of Mueller's deep dive into the 2016 campaign.\n\nIf the special counsel lives up to his reputation, his filings will feature surprising revelations and rich texture to color the picture he has already painted in indictments and witness testimony of a culture of endemic dishonesty in Trump's orbit about multiple, so far unexplainable, ties with Russians.\n\nRetired Lt.

He has bolstered his story with successful swoops against former Trump aides like Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates , showing their ties to pro-Russian figures in Ukrainian politics, in a case ostensibly about financial fraud in the dubious trade of international lobbying.\n\nThere has been speculation that he is trying to leave a detailed paper trail in public in case Trump manages to fire him in a power play or he is somehow constrained in his writing of a final report.\n\nThe continuum running through the investigation showing links between Trump's associates and businesses and Russia has been often subtle.\n\nBut it's increasingly hard to miss as Mueller plows into a new phase, one that is making it increasingly difficult for the President's defenders to claim that wrongdoing he has discovered unfolded far from the President's oblivious gaze.\n\nStepping up the pace of his probe since the midterm elections, Mueller has moved in a direction that appears increasingly threatening to the President, including his crossing of Trump's red line by showing interest in his family real estate empire.\n\nShifting gears\n\nSo far, as would be expected in an ongoing investigation, Mueller has not unveiled any allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia or that the President obstructed justice by trying to shut down the probe formerly overseen by fired FBI chief James Comey\n\nBut he is shifting up a gear following a week in which the Russia cloud enveloping the presidency darkened considerably.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cohen says he lied about project in Moscow Replay More Videos ...

It is unclear who gave him that impression, but it raised perilous new questions for the President and his team.\n\nAnother branch of Mueller's investigation is also emerging -- his interest in alleged communications between Trump's informal political adviser Roger Stone and associate Jerome Corsi with WikiLeaks, the website that published emails stolen by Russian spies from the Clinton campaign's chairman and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMeet the Mueller team Special counsel Robert Mueller assembled a team of at least 17 lawyers for his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMueller's methodical and increasingly visible activity seems to be playing on the mind of the President, who unleashed the latest in a flurry of angry tweet storms at the special counsel Monday.\n\n\"Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, don't want the truth, they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!\"\n\nFormer Donald Trump presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort is seen in October 2017 in the Bronx borough of New York City. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nIn Tuesday's scheduled filing about Flynn, Mueller is expected to reveal details of cooperation he obtained in a plea deal with the former general, who was constantly at Trump's side during the final stages of the 2016 campaign.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty last December to lying to the FBI about conversations about sanctions with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was fired three weeks into Trump's presidency after news reports revealed the true nature of Flynn's conversations and the White House said he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the calls.\n\nFlynn's conduct could bring others with whom he worked in the transition and the White House to Mueller's attention, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Pence and ex-deputy national security adviser KT McFarland.\n\nIn the year since he was charged, Flynn has been a recluse, and mystery surrounds the scope of his cooperation with Mueller. Some of that intrigue could begin to clear on Tuesday.\n\nFriday's document dump on Manafort is also generating fierce anticipation.\n\nMueller's team will explain in district court in Washington why they accused Trump's jailed ex-campaign chairman of lying to them, potentially jeopardizing his cooperation deal with the special counsel.\n\nAll eyes will be on the court docket to see if Manafort lied about Russia or the Trump campaign -- which could be explosive -- or something with less collateral damage, like his lobbying work in Ukraine, which led to a conviction in Virginia for fraud and tax evasion.\n\nThe spokesperson for the special counsel's office has said that at least part of the Manafort memo will be public. Some of it could be sealed.\n\nOdd coincidences\n\nRussia investigation watchers are also on alert for movement on multiple other open loops and baffling questions not yet answered by Mueller.\n\nFor example, what is to become of Gates?\n\nRichard Gates arrives at the Prettyman Federal Court Building for a hearing November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nManafort's business partner turned against his former boss and helped Mueller seal a conviction. But the special counsel was not done with Gates, and said in a filing last month that Gates was still aiding \"several ongoing investigations.\"\n\nThat in itself was a danger sign for Trump, since Gates was around the campaign for far longer than Manafort.\n\nOne of the most beguiling twists in Mueller's investigation concerns Konstantin Kilimnik -- a Manafort business associate who was so obscure that it took news outlets months to find a photo of him.\n\nIn a March court filing, Mueller's team revealed that Kilimnik \"has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.\" Not only that, but Kilimnik also was in contact with Manafort and Gates while they ran Trump's campaign. Kilimnik has already been charged by Mueller with witness tampering. Manafort was hit with the same obstruction charges and pleaded guilty in September.\n\nIf Mueller does eventually conclude that there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, it may turn out that Kilimnik was at the center of it.\n\nMueller also appears to be looking at a set of strange coincidences.\n\nHours after Trump publicly egged on the Russians to hack Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's emails in July 2016 -- Russian hackers apparently gave it their best shot, according to court filings. Mueller didn't connect the dots in his indictment of 12 Russian hackers, but he subtly noted that the attempted hack was \"the first time\" they had tried to breach Clinton's personal emails.\n\nThere was another example of suspicious timing in the Cohen indictment last week: Prosecutors revealed that Trump's fixer called off plans to visit Russia for the proposed Trump Tower Moscow deal on the exact day that first news reports emerged about Russia hacking the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAnd as Mueller continues circling Stone, evidence is mounting about his campaign season ties to WikiLeaks.\n\nDraft court filings obtained by CNN last week showed that Mueller's team has email evidence showing that Stone knew some details about the website's releases before they were public.\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Roger Stone associate Jerome Corsi?

Bush can perform one last, posthumous service to his country this week by orchestrating a rare moment of unity and a short-term truce in the rancorous politics swirling around the crisis-stricken Trump presidency.\n\nThe remains of the former president, who died at home in Texas on Friday night at 94, will be brought to Washington on Monday to allow the nation to bid farewell to a man whose one-term presidency looks better with each year that passes.\n\nThe ex-commander-in-chief will lie in state at the US Capitol ahead of a state funeral service in Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday that will see a meeting of the world's most exclusive club \u2014 that of former presidents.\n\nFor a few days, a building showdown over a possible partial government shutdown may ease, and the increasing threat posed to the Trump presidency by special counsel Robert Mueller could fade into the background.\n\nDespite antipathy between the Bush family and President Donald Trump, the 41st president made clear he wanted America's current leader to be at the funeral, putting the institution of the presidency above personal animosities.\n\nTrump has confirmed he will attend the event, which follows a series of national disasters and tragedies and moments of public mourning that have caused critics to fault his behavior as short of that expected of a president.\n\nTo his credit, Trump canceled what was certain to be a contentious news conference at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday out of respect for Bush. He also sent one of the iconic blue-and-white 747 jets that serves as Air Force One when a president is aboard to Texas to carry Bush's casket.\n\n\"We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life,\" Trump said in Argentina in a gracious tribute.\n\n\"So we look forward to doing that, and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's ceremony still promises to be an awkward moment of political theater for Trump, since he will come face-to-face with former presidents and other top officials whom he has attacked in recent days.\n\nJust last week for instance, Trump retweeted an image that pictures former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with former campaign rival Hillary Clinton, behind bars. Trump often beams at rallies as his crowds chant \"lock her up!\" about the former Democratic nominee. And Michelle Obama wrote in her new autobiography that she will \"never forgive\" Trump for his conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace that launched the real estate mogul and reality TV star's political career.\n\nTrump is likely to come face to face with all four in the National Cathedral before a huge television audience. The encounter will highlight how several of the former leaders, including Obama and Clinton, forged close relationships with their Republican predecessor as well as the friendly relations between them and Bush's son, former President George W. Bush. No such ties exist between that trio and the current President, who often criticizes his predecessors and has given no sign of taking advantage of their advice and experience of doing one of the toughest and loneliest jobs in global politics.\n\nThe President also belittled another of the elder Bush's sons, former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, during the 2016 campaign, and in July, mocked a signature quote by the 41st president about a \"thousand points of light,\" which was later used as the name of his charity.\n\nUnavoidable comparisons\n\nWednesday's state funeral will offer similarities and contrasts to the final farewell for John McCain in September, to which Trump was not invited after mocking the Arizona senator during the 2016 campaign for being shot down and imprisoned in Vietnam nearly 50 years before.\n\nSuch analogies are likely to be perceived again in the tributes to Bush, who was almost universally regarded as a gentleman and a throwback to a more civil and magnanimous era of politics.\n\nStill, with Trump attending, and if he desists from his trademark inflammatory politics, the nation's divides could be papered over, at least for a few days.\n\nBush's passing also looks set to postpone one of the final political showdowns of the year \u2014 a funding controversy entangled in Trump's demands for $5 billion in funding for his border wall.\n\nA source briefed on the talks told CNN that lawmakers are considering taking up a one-week spending bill to avoid a partial government shutdown by a Friday deadline, since Congress will be out of session at the beginning of the week ahead of Bush's ceremonies.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would be open to such a solution.\n\n\"I would absolutely consider it and probably give it,\" Trump said.\n\nRussia cloud darkens over Trump\n\nWashington's period of mourning come at a fraught moment in Trump's presidency, after a week in which it became clear that Mueller is narrowing in on the President as his investigation gathers pace.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller unveiled a cooperation agreement with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Cohen admitted to lying to Congress to cover up the fact that he was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow right up until June 2016 during the presidential campaign.\n\nHe had previously said talks about the Moscow project ended in January 2016 and said he lied out of a sense of obligation to Trump.\n\nA pair of developments on Friday night appeared to bring the probe even closer to the White House. CNN reported that Cohen believed that Trump would offer him a pardon in exchange for staying on message in in talks with federal prosecutors.\n\nTrump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump never indicated any such possibility to Cohen. But the report immediately sparked speculation about communications between the two men. Any proof that Trump had offered a pardon in return for Cohen's testimony would be an abuse of power and possibly an impeachable offense.\n\nThen, in a filing later on Friday, Cohen's lawyers offered the clearest sign yet that he kept Trump informed of his efforts to close the deal in Moscow in 2016.\n\nA political hiatus over the next few days might give Trump some brief relief from Russia questions but could also complicate his effort to celebrate an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to stave off an escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn exchange, China will buy a \"very substantial\" amount of agricultural, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance, according to a White House statement."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Retired FDA research monkeys find new home and music in Florida", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/2uicef8Z0j8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "She covered her grin with a medical mask, calmly walked to the middle of a climate-controlled room and greeted each of the 26 monkeys.

The 26 remaining monkeys were retired to Jungle Friends, and the FDA quickly established an Animal Welfare Council to oversee all animal research under the agency's purview.\n\nThe squirrel monkeys are the latest arrivals.\n\nThe common squirrel monkey , or Saimiri sciureus , typically can be found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, roaming from Costa Rica through central Brazil and Bolivia. These monkeys typically have a life span of about 20 years. The males weigh between 1.22 and 2.53 pounds on average, and the females average between 1.43 and 2.76 pounds.\n\nWhen the monkeys arrived, Bagnall said, they all looked \"gorgeous\" and healthy, needing no serious medical care -- except for Oak, who the FDA had told the sanctuary had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and was receiving treatment.\n\nBagnall thanked the FDA for releasing the monkeys to her sanctuary's care.\n\n\"The most special thing about these particular monkeys is that they came out of the FDA, which has not released monkeys out of research in the past -- and we are so happy that now the FDA is opting to retire monkeys after the research has ended. They didn't have to do this,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"All of these monkeys were born inside,\" she said. \"They've never been outside. So they've never felt the sun on their face or the grass under their feet or rain or wind. It's all going to be such a new experience for them, and they're all just so different and individual. They'll all react differently.\"\n\nFor now, the monkeys are being kept indoors until spring, when they will be introduced to their new outdoor environment.\n\nA 'scientific, ethical and economic' debate\n\nThe monkeys used in the nicotine addiction study are just a sliver of a larger debate around medical research on animals.\n\nIn the United States, 75,825 non-human primates were used in experiments at animal research facilities last year; an additional 34,369 were held in facilities but not used for study, according to the US Department of Agriculture\n\nAs for the FDA's latest decision, animal rights activists celebrated the monkeys' arrival at their new retirement home in Florida.\n\nSome scientists questioned what the move could mean for the future of medical research.\n\nMatthew Bailey, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, said in January that \"undoubtedly, some will argue that this recent action by the FDA is a reason to end research with animal models. But given the inextricable role humane and responsible animal research plays in the health of the overall population, and the health of the animals about which we care so deeply, that is a very dangerous proposition.\n\n\"Animals played a role in the development of each of the top 25 most prescribed drugs in America,\" he said, adding that pets, farm animals and wildlife benefit from medical treatments developed in part from animal research.\n\n\"Farm animals and wildlife are routinely vaccinated against any number of diseases, but those vaccines wouldn't be available without animal research,\" he said. \"If you love animals, you really should support animal research.\"\n\nWhile visiting Jungle Friends last week, Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for the taxpayer watchdog group White Coat Waste Project, said that technologies, including computer models, could replace animal models in research.\n\n\"The truth is that, for scientific, ethical and economic reasons, animal experimentation is incredibly wasteful and needs to go the way of the dinosaur,\" he said. \"Technologies that replace the use of animals are more effective.\"\n\nAdjusting to the outside world\n\nWhen lab animals retire at sanctuaries, most people assume that they are immediately released outdoors to run free.\n\nThat's not often the case, Bagnall said, adding that a gradual introduction to the outdoors seems to benefit the animals more.\n\n\"You would think 'Oh, we're going to give them all this space and be outside,' but sometimes they're a little nervous about that, and they've never been outside,\" Bagnall said.\n\nFor the 26 squirrel monkeys, including Oak, Bagnall and her team are introducing them to the outdoors gradually by putting elements they will encounter -- such as banana leaves, bamboo, or pine straw -- in the monkeys' cages.\n\n\"So they get used to what things feel like and look like and smell like first,\" Bagnall said.\n\n\"It's a gradual process, and it will probably take four to five months,\" she said. \"Then they're going to be released into their outdoor habitats.\"\n\nAnother reason the monkeys are not being released immediately to the outdoors is because of the cold winter weather, she added, and in the spring, they can adjust to the new climate.\n\nMeanwhile, all of the monkeys undergo routine medical evaluations, with Oak requiring more specialized care.\n\nOak, who is 5 years old, has puzzled the Jungle Friends care team with his rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, said Dr. Bobby Collins, a retired veterinarian who once oversaw the welfare of research animals in academic settings and now volunteers at Jungle Friends.\n\n\"This is unusual,\" said Collins, who has been treating Oak. \"Because you just don't see squirrel monkeys or non-human primates having rheumatoid arthritis. It's not diagnosed very frequently, and this is a young animal. Most of the time, if you're going to see it in animals, it's older animals, where they've got chronic inflammation.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED What is rheumatoid arthritis? Replay More Videos ...

It alters how we house the animal and let him interact with the other animals,\" Collins said.\n\n\"That social interaction for non-human primates is so important. You can see these guys get depressed when they're deprived of contact with other animals their own species,\" he said. \"So we want to try to remove those flareups or minimize them so he can, again, interact with monkeys and be a monkey.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the monkeys had a \"music hour\" and listened to the soundtrack of \"Forrest Gump\" while playing in their cages.\n\nOak sipped from an in-cage water bottle before nestling into a corner with his tail curled over his shoulder. \"Joy to the World\" by Three Dog Night sang out across the room: \"Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea, joy to you and me.\"\n\nIn that moment, Oak appeared relaxed.\n\nThe road to retirement\n\nThe saga of Oak and the other squirrel monkeys began in 2014.\n\nThat year, the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research conducted a study to examine the behavioral and biological effects of nicotine in squirrel monkeys. The research was an effort to better understand how reducing nicotine levels would impact them, and ultimately to better understand how it affects humans.\n\nAfter learning about the study, White Coat Waste Project, an advocacy group working to stop taxpayer-funded animal research, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for materials related to that research. The group claimed that the response it received didn't comply with its request, and in August 2017, it sued the FDA\n\nAbout a month later, world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall penned a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noting that she was \"disturbed\" and shocked\" to learn that the agency was still performing nicotine addiction experiments on monkeys.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb responded directly to Goodall , writing, \"After learning of concerns related to the study you referenced, I directed the agency to place a hold on the research study earlier this month. Accordingly, at this time, all experimentation involving the monkeys in the study you referenced has been halted.\"\n\nBecause the study was terminated prior to completion, behavioral data from the research is incomplete, FDA spokeswoman Tara Rabin wrote in an email Monday.\n\nIf the study had been completed, the FDA still would have considered moving the monkeys to a sanctuary, she wrote. \"In light of the decision to halt the study, the FDA currently has no plans to conduct additional squirrel monkey research.\"\n\nAccording to the FDA's website , animals are sometimes used in the testing of drugs, vaccines and other biologics, and medical devices, mainly to determine the safety of these medical products.\n\nIn January, Rabin wrote in a separate email that individual animal care committees are tasked with study-specific oversight, but \"the newly established Animal Welfare Council will track all studies across the FDA and provide centralized oversight and coordination of all animal research activities and facilities under the agency's purview. This Council will advise on the agency's approach to animal welfare issues and ensure alignment of animal studies with the agency's mission.\"\n\n\"This is another example of our efforts to reduce animal research,\" FDA spokeswoman Nina Devlin wrote in an email Saturday.\n\nThe FDA has also taken steps to develop and use other research models that don't involve animals, Rabin said Monday, including forming a working group to accelerate adopting modeling and simulation tools.\n\n\"These are just some of the many FDA initiatives underway to reduce reliance on animal-based studies, while still helping to ensure that Americans have access to safe, reliable and effective medical products and safe food,\" she wrote.\n\nSome politicians applauded the FDA's decision to terminate its nicotine study and establish a council to review future animal research.\n\n\"I'm proud that a Florida sanctuary stepped up to give these monkeys a home,\" Florida Rep.

CNN found Springfield officers gave victims these forms soon after they reported being assaulted and before investigations were complete, effectively ending cases.\n\nThe CNN investigation \"Destroyed,\" which published Thursday, revealed that 25 law enforcement agencies in 14 states destroyed 400 rape kits tied to cases in which the statutes of limitations were still running or there was no time limit to prosecute.\n\nThe number is likely higher. CNN surveyed 207 law enforcement agencies; there are an estimated 17,000 in the country. CNN's analysis was based on records provided by the departments that reported destroying kits.\n\nSpringfield stood out among other departments for the volume and variety of investigative mistakes that led to the disposal of evidence and how quickly kits were destroyed.\n\nPolice in the state's third largest city discarded 108 rape kits since 2010 while a prosecution was still viable under the law. Of those kits, 75% were never tested for DNA. Dozens of untested kits were destroyed in a year or less after victims reported being assaulted. At the time the cases were reported, there was no statute of limitations on prosecuting forcible rape or forcible sodomy in Missouri. The shortest time limit for any other felony was three years.\n\nWilliams did not respond to CNN's request for comment on his plans to reform some practices.\n\nSpringfield police chief Paul Williams reacted to CNN's investigation by saying he would make changes in how sexual assault investigations are handled.\n\nCNN found that the department had a practice of pressuring victims and rushing cases to a close.\n\nThe department mailed letters to victims soon after they reported they were assaulted -- sometimes on the same day that detectives were assigned to investigate. Those letters gave them 10 days to engage with an investigator. If they did not respond, police closed their cases and labeled the victims uncooperative. The victims had already given statements to patrol officers and undergone rape exams, actions that experts said strongly demonstrated a desire for the assaults to be investigated.\n\nOne expert who examined Springfield case files decried the practices as \"old fashioned\" and \"horrendous.\"\n\n\"You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations,\" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault , who ran the San Diego police department's sex crimes unit for 10 years.\n\nThe 10-day letter was \"appalling,\" said another expert, Carol Tracy , a Philadelphia attorney who has worked with the Philadelphia Police Department since 2000 to annually review the quality of its sex crimes investigations.\n\nMany readers were outraged by what CNN revealed and by the chief's initial response to \"Destroyed.\" Hours after the story published, he released a statement that acknowledged that \"errors\" were made in past cases. He told Springfield TV station and CNN affiliate KY3 that his agency was no different than others across the country in how it handled sexual assault investigations and evidence. \"That was the norm 10, 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nCNN's report, however, covered cases reported between 2006 and 2014. And records show the department discarded untested kits as recently as 2015; Williams had told CNN he was unaware of that destruction.\n\nIn addition, experts said the department failed to follow best practices that date back as far as 2005.\n\nJUST WATCHED 4-year-old girl 'absolutely robbed' of justice Replay More Videos ...

Some called for Williams' firing or punishment of the detectives whose cases CNN featured.\n\n\"This is why rape/sexual assault SURVIVORS don't come forward...\" one person wrote.\n\nSaid another post: \"I think everyone involved should be fired.\"\n\nSpringfield City Manager Jason Gage told the Springfield News-Leader Friday that he has \"the highest confidence in the police department\" and how it handles sexual assault investigations.\n\nWilliams said the department is \"committed to submitting all rape kits to a lab to be analyzed and will retain rape kits indefinitely.\"\n\nThat is something that police now are required to do by law. In August, Missouri lawmakers enacted a statute requiring police to submit kits to labs within 14 days of receiving the evidence and maintain that evidence for at least 30 years.\n\nThe chief's promises to do better are not enough for an organization called Me Too Springfield . The 200-member group -- comprised of mental health professionals, survivors of sexual assault and those who work on their behalf -- want the department to outline specific action.\n\nThe group reacted to CNN's investigation by sending a letter to the department Thursday. In it, members demanded to know how the agency would ensure the public that investigations will be conducted properly, kits will be tested and evidence will be maintained for the length of the statutes of limitations.\n\n\"We definitely need to see not only that you acknowledge the errors, but how you're going to fix them,\" Me Too Springfield President Jordan Harris told CNN.\n\nIn CNN's investigation, Williams blamed inadequate staffing for how sex crimes investigations were handled.\n\nIn its letter, Me Too Springfield wrote that being understaffed was an \"inappropriate excuse for violating best practices and voluntarily destroying evidence.\"\n\nHarris said the group will ask Williams for all sex crimes investigators' current caseloads.\n\n\"It's his responsibility to make sure that these victims feel safe, and that they're able to come forward if they are brave enough to,\" she said.\n\nHarris was raped years ago, she said. She did not report the assault to police, but she shares that trauma publicly now. CNN typically does not publish the names of rape victims without their consent.\n\n\"It's important to us that people know that even if your trauma happened a long time ago, if you went through the trauma, lived that over again by getting a rape kit, that your case absolutely deserves justice.\"\n\nOn Monday, she sent CNN the department's response to the Me Too Springfield letter.\n\nIt was emailed by a police spokesperson and repeated that the agency was going to test and keep rape kits and \"continuously review all our policies and practices.\" It also said that the department strives \"to maintain appropriate levels of staffing and making that a reality is an on-going goal.\"\n\nTaxes, the letter said, will help pay to add more officers to work sex crimes.\n\nMe Too Springfield asked how many untested kits the department still has and was told that Williams ordered a review of all sexual assault kits in 2014 and determined there were \"an excess of 300 that had not been tested\" at that time. The number, the letter said, has been reduced to 237. The department said it expects to eliminate that backlog within the next two years.\n\nHarris said Me Too Springfield emailed the department spokesperson Sunday asking for a one-on-one meeting with Williams.\n\n\"We're just ready to work with the police department and maybe come up with some new ways to help sexual assault victims,\" she said.\n\nHarris provided a copy of that email to CNN. It says the group wants to \"identify areas where we can help improve the system for the thousands of sexual assault survivors in Springfield, and the thousands more that are likely yet to be.\"\n\nAs of Monday night, the group had not received a response."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "After a mysterious illness paralyzed her son, mom turned to polio survivors for answers", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/T4jj2WJW5RY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "It was 2012, and her 1-year-old son, Lucian, had suddenly become paralyzed from the waist down. While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California, she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.\n\nBut that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM.\n\nEven on Facebook, his mother couldn't find kindred souls.\n\nThen, one day, a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.\n\nOlivera was in her last semester of nursing school, and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors, since her son's disease and polio are similar.\n\nThe members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.\n\nAFM and polio: eerie similarities\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, polio crippled more than 35,000 people a year on average, making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nPolio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients, mainly children, start out with what looks like a cold or the flu, and then paralysis strikes.\n\nSince 2014, there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states, according to the CDC . The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.\n\nThanks to the polio vaccine, the US has been polio free since 1979 , according to the CDC.\n\nBut there is no cure or vaccine for AFM, and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.\n\nSome have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray, a physical therapist in Oregon, scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient, Bailey Sheehan, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed.\n\n\"I was unsure and a little nervous, because I wanted to help, but this was such uncharted territory,\" Murray said. \"I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio.\"\n\nBailey, now 11, suffers frequent headaches, and is weak in her right arm, but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research.\"Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again,\" Mikell Sheehan said.\n\n\n\nBailey Sheehan's physical therapist, Melissa Murray, researched care for children with polio to help Bailey recover from AFM.\n\nLooking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease, as Murray and others have done with AFM, is \"extraordinary,\" according to David Oshinsky, a professor of history at New York University, and author of \"Polio: An American Story,\" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006.\n\n\"To me, that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that,\" he said.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center, she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?\n\nThen she saw one of the polio survivors, who sat in a motorized wheelchair, pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh, much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.\n\nIt was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera, because that's how Lucian moved his leg, too.\n\nShe knew she was in the right place.\n\nSo did the polio survivors.\n\n\"Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" said Sherrill Boyd, 79, who contracted polio when she was 9.\n\nThe survivors' advice came almost immediately, some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table, Olivera, who went to etiquette school as a girl, winced. The polio survivors laughed.\n\n\"They said, 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'\" Olivera remembers. \"So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!\"\n\nAs Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story, she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian, she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.\n\nSeeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt.\n\n\"Hey, cover that thing up,\" a passerby yelled.\n\nHe was referring to her leg brace.\n\n\"I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!\" remembers Puch, who's now 65. \"I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?\"\n\nShe told Olivera not to listen to the haters, and to think of Lucian as just like any other child.\n\n\"When I was a girl, I didn't think of myself as different, or compromised, even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children,\" Puch said.\n\nThat advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings.\n\n\"Up until that point, we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him, or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all,\" she remembers. \"After the meeting, my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability.\"\n\n\"We were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability,\" Erin Olivera said.\n\nToday, at age 7, Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister, but in a modified way -- for example, to clean up his room, he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker, and then places them back on the shelf.\n\nNot wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation, Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski, a polio survivor who wrote a memoir, \" Too Early for Flowers ,\" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAfter the meeting, one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks, since people with paralysis often have cold feet.\n\nThe socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life.\n\n\"That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight,\" she said. \"They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things, too.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Polio-like illness AFM 'appears to have peaked' in US for the year", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/ytQMolddxHw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The number of cases of the polio-like illness acute flaccid myelitis \"appears to have peaked\" for 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.\n\nIn its weekly update on cases of the illness, the agency said there have been 134 confirmed cases in 33 states this year.

She began questioning the world, her life and who she was. \"You start thinking, 'what species am I? Where do I belong?' \"\n\nThe announcement that she says changed her life was made by powerful politician Paul Makonda, regional governor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. At the end of October, he vowed to set up a task force to round up and arrest people suspected of being gay.\n\nShe first identified as a trans woman in 2016, having previously considered herself to be a gay man. \"It took courage,\" she said. \"Tanzania is a very religious country.\"\n\nAlthough she was \"very intelligent\" about coming out and about going only to known LGBT-friendly settings, she now feels that things have taken several steps back.\n\nFour weeks ago, she fled her home in Dar es Salaam to go to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, with the help of Kenya-based nongovernmental organization Jinsiangu, which is supported by the International AIDS Alliance and its Rapid Response Fund.\n\n\"It was so bad, I had go,\" she said. The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi.\n\n\"I'm free here,\" she said.\n\n'If you know any gays, report them to me'\n\nMakonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country, forcing many into hiding.\n\nStating that his phone number is widely known, \"I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays, report them to me,\" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.\n\nPaul Makonda, a politician in Tanzania, launched an anti-gay crackdown, threatening to arrest people suspected of being homosexuals.\n\nPeople already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said. There needs to be more peer-led outreach and services, as government services will not reach vulnerable people in such political climates.\n\nTanzania's Ministry of Health and a government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'They are making us fear, like we are not human beings'\n\nPeople involved in peer programs in Tanzania risk abuse but believe that in their work to help and educate people about the importance of HIV prevention as well as living with the condition, in addition to ensuring that they know their rights -- keeping them out of prison and away from the risk of infection.\n\n\"People are not free,\" said Faki, whose name has been changed to ensure his safety. The government is \"making us fear, like we are not human beings.\"\n\nFaki has been openly homosexual for just a few years, having gained the courage to come out through attending training and information sessions with local community groups.\n\nTwo years ago, he and two fellow activists formed an organization to work primarily with LGBT groups on his home island of Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam, he says, his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police. His work has gotten him arrested too, he said.\n\n\"We have no support anymore,\" he said.\n\n, Faki helped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while Just a few days after Makonda's announcement for local task forces in Dar es SalaamFakihelped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while on local Pongwe beach , he said. They were reported by the driver who took them there. Amnesty International also reported the arrests.\n\nAt the same time, Faki had another LGBT friend come to stay with him, in hiding from Dar es Salaam, he said.\n\nThough his goal in life is to make LGBT people aware of their rights to make them confident about their sexuality in public and in the face of aggressive law enforcement, he also worries about the health of this community.\n\nAccess is a core issue, and another prohibitive factor is the attitude of health care workers at clinics, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf people find out you're gay, they're not friendly, he said, adding that if people do go to clinics for care, they can't be free and explain themselves or their situation, causing extra problems and \"contributing to the spread of HIV.\"\n\nHe is not hopeful about his island's or country's future.\n\nGlobal outcry in response to Mankonda's announcement has calmed the situation somewhat in Dar es Salaam and nationwide, but not entirely.\n\n\"People don't want to change their mindset on this issue,\" Faki said, referring mainly to government leaders.

And they have now decided enough is enough, giving Moscow a clear deadline of 60 days to come back into compliance or the US will itself cease to honour its terms.\n\nNato allies here share Washington's concerns and have backed the US position, thankful perhaps that it includes this short grace period during which Russia might change its mind.\n\nBut the chances of that are slim. And the fear is that the collapse of the INF agreement could help to unravel the whole system of arms control treaties, which have been so important in maintaining strategic stability.\n\nIn 2014, then US President Barack Obama accused Russia of breaching the INF Treaty after it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile.\n\nHe reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race.\n\nThe last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles.\n\nHis administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009.

Joanna Cherry MP; David Martin MEP; (from bottom left) Alyn Smith MEP; Ross Greer MSP and Andy Wightman MSP\n\nA cross-party group of politicians and campaigners including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler brought the case together with lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project.\n\nThey initially took it to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which ultimately agreed to pass it to the ECJ.\n\nTwo attempts by the UK government to appeal against the referral to the European court were rejected, and the case was opposed by the government and the EU institutions in a hearing before all 27 ECJ judges last week.\n\nHubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could create \"endless uncertainty\" by allowing countries to announce they are leaving the EU in an attempt to secure better membership terms, before cancelling their withdrawal.\n\nThe UK government's lawyers argued that the case was purely hypothetical as \"the UK does not intend to revoke its notification\", and ECJ judges should therefore refuse to rule on it.\n\nThey added that the politicians behind the case wanted to use it as \"political ammunition to be used in, and to pressure, the UK parliament\".\n\nAnalysis by Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent\n\nThe advocate general's opinion that the UK has the right to unilaterally withdraw Article 50 notification of its intention to leave the EU flies in the face of what the UK government and the EU want.\n\nAlthough the Advocate General's opinion is non-binding, the ECJ follow his opinions in the majority of cases.\n\nThe whole issue of revocation remains hypothetical at present because the government has made it clear there is no possibility of seeking to revoke the notice to leave the EU.\n\nHowever, the statement raises the question of how the UK might revoke notification.\n\nIt would almost certainly need to be done by an act of parliament. If it was done by ministers alone using prerogative powers it would frustrate the will of parliament as expressed in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.\n\nIt should be noted that the statement and the case concerns revocation of notice to leave, and not a delay or extension of the two-year period provided for under Article 50.\n\nThat period can be extended, but only with the agreement of all of the other 27 EU states. Whereas extension of the Article 50 period could become a political necessity, revocation of Article 50 remains something of an academic point at present. However, that would change if there was a second referendum in which the British people voted to remain in the EU."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Taxpayers treated unfairly by HMRC, says House of Lords report", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46431167", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:00:41", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nGreater powers given to HMRC to tackle tax avoidance and evasion are undermining the rule of law and justice, warns a House of Lords report.\n\nThe Economic Affairs Committee said HMRC has been granted some broad, disproportionate powers without effective taxpayer safeguards.\n\nHigh penalties, designed to deter taxpayers from appealing, are a tax on justice, the committee claimed.\n\nIt has demanded a review of the oversight of HMRC and its powers.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, said: \"HMRC is right to tackle tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.

Yet they now face unjustifiable and life-destroying tax bills they cannot pay and cannot fairly appeal.\"\n\nBut in a briefing note published this summer, HMRC noted that almost two-thirds of those affected work in the business services sector, which includes management and IT consultants, and fewer than 3% work in medical services (doctors and nurses) and teaching.\n\nIt added that disguised remuneration schemes users, on average, earned twice as much as the average UK taxpayer and that 70% of users have used the schemes for two years or more.\n\nHMRC warned that repeated use of the schemes would \"inevitably result in large tax liabilities\".\n\nCase study: 'She has no means of paying it'\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOne case presented to the committee concerned a social worker who was made redundant by her local council.\n\nThe evidence reported: \"It had a farewell party on the Friday, and on the Monday it said 'If you join this agency and use the scheme, we will re-engage you as a contractor.'\n\n\"She was re-engaged as a contractor for five years but at the end of the five years, the council told her it would re-employ her as an employee, which it did.\n\n\"She was unaware of what was going on.

As such, they should still retain clues to the events that brought the Sun and the planets into being.\n\nEngineers have developed a collection device for Osiris-Rex that will extend on a robotic arm and \"high five\" the surface of Bennu.\n\nOn contact, this mechanism will deliver a burst of gas to kick up loose fragments that should then settle in a holding chamber prior to being packed away in the return capsule.\n\n\"Other probes have brought back samples, for example... the Hayabusa mission from Japan brought back a small sample from its asteroid. But ours will be by far the largest sample collection by a robotic spacecraft,\" explained Nasa project manager Rich Burns. Possibly up to 2kg if the retrieval system works well.\n\nNot since Apollo at the Moon has so great a mass of material been retrieved from another planetary body.\n\nOn Monday, Osiris-Rex and Bennu were about 120 million km from Earth\n\n\"We've been slowly creeping up to Bennu and in that time we've been taking the opportunity to snap images... and it's really given us an opportunity to have a sneak peek of what we're about to embark on,\" said Dr Enos.\n\n\"We can see the surface has a lot of boulders, craters - a lot of diversity. So, it's been really exciting. We're also getting images which are giving us insight to potential sample sites that we will start to explore more thoroughly over the next year and a half.\"\n\nPreliminary scientific findings from the approach images are due to be released at next week's American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington DC.\n\nOsiris-Rex - Mission to Asteroid Bennu\n\nImage copyright NASA\n\nIt's been a two-year journey to Bennu, arriving 3 December 2018\n\nAfter a period of mapping, sampling should occur in July 2020\n\nOsiris-Rex will have up to three attempts to grab surface material\n\nThe probe will leave Bennu most likely in March 2021\n\nIts sample capsule should land on Earth on 24 September 2023\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Research worms 'too old' to go to space station", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-46438759", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:00", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption The worms will be fired into space on a rocket, before linking up with the International Space Station\n\nThousands of worms being blasted into space could be \"too old\" for research when they get to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe launch of a SpaceX rocket was delayed after mouldy food was found among another research team's kit.\n\nTeams from Exeter, Nottingham and Lancaster universities are hoping the microscopic worms could lead to new treatments for muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe worms were meant to be \"just turning into adults\" at the launch.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was due to launch from the NASA Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Tuesday evening, but has now been rescheduled for 18:16 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nThe 24-hour delay means that the worms will be a day older than planned when they reach the ISS, and the research teams may have to rely on \"back-up colonies\" that will need to be prepared for their unexpected trip.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Worm muscles to help astronauts in space\n\nLibby Jackson, from the UK Space Agency, said: \"The timing will be quite critical to the worm research, they were ready to go into the capsule and it had been timed that they were just turning into adults at the time of launch.\n\n\"That's now all gone out of the window because everything has shifted by a day.\n\n\"This is what happens in space flight, we've always got to be prepared.\"\n\nThe Molecular Muscle Experiment aims to \"understand the causes of neuromuscular decline in space\", she added.\n\nImage copyright Alexander Gerst Image caption The crew that will conduct experiments on the worms arrived at the ISS on Monday\n\nA Russian Soyuz crew ship launched from Kazakhstan on Monday with two new astronauts - Anne McClain, an American who studied at Bath and Bristol universities, and Canadian David Saint-Jacques, who studied at Cambridge University.\n\nThey were joined by veteran cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko.\n\nThe worms share many biological characteristics with humans, according to Exeter University, including \"alterations to muscle and the ability to use energy\".\n\nDr Timothy Etheridge said space flight represented \"an accelerated model of the human ageing condition\".\n\n\"Hopefully by understanding molecular causes and counter measures against that, space flight may provide an opportunity to understand human ageing on earth,\" he added.\n\nThe worms\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The nematode worm species, Caenorhabditis elegans, is about 1mm in length"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "What is that bright object next to the moon?", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-46438890", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:02", "body_paragraphs": "Venus and the moon have been lighting up the sky delighting early rising stargazers.\n\nHere is a selection of your photos.\n\nImage copyright Tim Clark/@buildark Image caption Tim Clark posts from Dorset on Instagram: \"Lovely early morning walk today.

Climate change is a global issue, so the time is now for animals to do their part to help protect the environment, and that means cows working to offset their carbon footprint, birds cutting down on excess travel, and fish having fewer children.

Shops were looted and vandalised and hundreds were injured in the clashes.\n\n\"We are in a state of insurrection, I've never seen anything like it,\" Jeanne d'Hauteserre, mayor of Paris's 8th district, said.\n\nThe protests, which began on November 17 over hikes in diesel taxes, have widened into an uprising against President Emmanuel Macron and become the biggest challenge to his presidency.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government finally backpedalled on its initial policy decision and announced plans to halt the planned price increases.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the \"yellow vest\" movement and what implications it has for France.\n\nWho are the 'yellow vests'?\n\nThe movement takes its name from the high-visibility jackets protesters have adopted as a symbol of their complaint. Protests sprang up spontaneously in October against hikes in car fuel taxes, with supporters donning the fluorescent safety vests that French law requires all motorists to carry.\n\nProtesters are angry over record prices at the pump, as diesel has increased by about 20 percent in the past year to an average of 1.49 euros ($1.68), a move Macron said was necessary to combat climate change and protect the environment.\n\nInitially backed by people in small towns and rural France where most get around by car, the protests snowballed into a wider movement against Macron's perceived bias in favour of the elite and well-off city dwellers.\n\nAnalysts say most of those joining the ranks of the \"yellow vests\" are workers on lower middle incomes who say they barely scrape by and get scant public services in exchange for some of the highest tax bills in Europe.\n\nOn Monday, the discontent spread to include ambulance workers and some high schools, with students upset about scholastic reforms.\n\nWhat do they want?\n\nSupporters' goals are amorphous. Some want to reverse Macron's tax cuts for the rich while others want more measures to help the poorest.\n\nMany have called on the business-friendly president, a former investment banker, to resign.\n\nThe fuel tax \"was the spark,\" said Thierry Paul Valette, a Paris protest coordinator.\n\n\"If it hadn't been (that), it would have been something else,\" he told the Associated Press news agency.\n\n\"People want fair fiscal justice. They want social justice,\" he added, as well as improved purchasing power.\n\nHow big is the movement?\n\nMotorists have blocked highways across the country since November 17, setting up barricades and deploying convoys of slow-moving trucks. Nearly 300,000 protested in the streets across the country that day.\n\nLess than half that number, about 106,000, took to the streets on November 24th, when a protest in Paris took a particularly violent turn.\n\nOn Saturday, an estimated 75,000 demonstrators, were counted across the country in the afternoon, the interior ministry said.\n\nMost protests across France were peaceful, but the one in Paris degenerated into the worst rioting the capital has seen in decades.\n\nWhat happened in Paris?\n\nShops were looted and cars torched in plush neighbourhoods around the famed Champs Elysees avenue, as protesters intent on causing as much damage as possible mixed in with the \"yellow vests\".\n\nThe Arc de Triomphe was besmirched with graffiti and vandalized inside. \"The yellow vests will triumph,\" one scrawled slogan said. More than 400 were arrested during the clashes.\n\nAnne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, said on Sunday: \"Once we learn the costs of this destruction, I think everyone will be stunned at how huge it will be.\"\n\nSome organisers of the protests have denounced the violence, saying those behind the violence were attempting to \"usurp\" the \"yellow vests\".\n\nMeanwhile, Jason Herbert, a representative of the \"yellow vests\" who met briefly on Friday with the prime minister, said he and others had to bow out of talks with the government because of threats from fellow demonstrators.

Until then, the Middle East had not been a major focus of his administration, which was preoccupied with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, the re-unification of Germany and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\nThat all changed with the Iraqi invasion of its much smaller and wealthier neighbour.\n\nBush later recalled that the first 48 hours after Iraqi troops crossed the Kuwaiti border were the \"most hectic\" of his presidency up to that point.\n\nOver the next seven months, until the Iraqi surrender in late February 1991, the crisis was the top foreign policy priority of the Bush White House.\n\nThis had as much to do with the nature, location and timing of the crisis as it did with restoring Kuwaiti sovereignty or \"facing down a threat to decency and humanity\", as Bush framed it in his January 1991 State of the Union address.\n\n2012122375918127727\n\nIt was, for example, the first time since Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to end the Cold War in December 1989 that a regional player had tried to swallow a small actor lacking military power.\n\nThis challenge to the evolving post-Cold War balance of power was all the more intolerable because it took place in a region that was home to 65 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its net oil exports.\n\nKuwait's oil-rich neighbours, in particular Saudi Arabia, were terrified that Saddam would turn on them next. \"He who eats Kuwait for breakfast is likely to ask for something else for lunch,\" the influential Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, is said to have warned.\n\nThe crisis also occurred at a time when an anxious world was still struggling to work out what the post-Cold War international order would look like and what role the US, as the only remaining superpower, would play in it.\n\nMany speculated that in the absence of the Soviet threat, US leaders would lack the political will or the domestic support to continue to play a lead role in international affairs.\n\nSome even argued that the US would now be eclipsed on the global stage by non-military powers like Japan, the European Union or even the United Nations.\n\nIn reality, the ease with which the US built a global anti-Saddam coalition and defeated his army in Kuwait put paid to such speculation.\n\nAt home, this helped Washington overcome the \"Vietnam Syndrome\" that had influenced public and elite opinion on military engagement overseas since the withdrawal from Southeast Asia in the early 1970s.\n\nAbroad, it provided the opportunity to showcase to the world just how dominant US diplomatic and hard-power capabilities would be in Bush's evolving \"new world order\".\n\nIt also sent an important message to would-be allies that the US would come to their assistance when needed and would honour its obligations as the dominant global player to promote and protect their interests, as well as their security.\n\nIn the post-war Gulf, this new US commitment was conceived primarily in military terms and expressed itself in new defence treaties with local partners and the stockpiling of enough military hardware and pre-positioned heavy equipment in the region to fight, or at least start, a war at a short notice.\n\nA common joke of the time was that the US was settling into the region so well it should join the Arab League.\n\nBush's intervention in Kuwait failed to secure him a second term in the White House. He also faced criticism from various sides.\n\nSome refused to accept the legitimacy of his \"war for oil\" as the peace movement of the day termed it or saw his intervention in Iraq as a classic case of neo-colonial aggression that would define the post-Cold War era.\n\nOthers accused him of being too cautious for refusing to go into Iraq and overthrow Saddam or for failing to provide support for anti-Saddam forces in Iraq who rose up in response to events in Kuwait.\n\nHe also faced criticism for being too beholden to the interests of Saudi royals, an accusation that would become even more pronounced during his son's presidency in the post-9/11 era and is very evident now in the Trump administration's handling of the Khashoggi affair.\n\nDuring his two terms as president, Bill Clinton followed the Bush approach in the Gulf of pursuing US interests and those of local allies by using the threat of overwhelming force to keep Iran and Iraq in check.\n\nIn the decade and a half since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, Bush's successors in the White House, beginning with his own son, have all found it far more difficult to reach agreement with local Gulf partners on what the US security role should be than he did following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the successful resolution of the Kuwait crisis.\n\nIn part this is due to the changing nature of threats in an age when strong insurgencies, transnational non-state violent actors, popular revolt and intra-state clashes like the one that resulted in the June 2017 blockade of Qatar have all come to the fore.\n\nBut it is also a consequence of the erosion, during the presidencies of George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, of three of the defining hallmarks of George H W Bush's international engagement and leadership: caution, reliability and predictability in using the massive hard and soft-power capabilities of the country to promote its interests and those of local allies.\n\nThis was Bush Senior's foreign policy legacy to the world and it was introduced in response to the Kuwait crisis.\n\nIts erosion since then has led to rising scepticism over the effectiveness and legitimacy of US foreign policy choices. It has also been an important factor in the shrinking power gap between the US and its main international competitors.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/worldrss.xml", "title": "Palestinians clash with Israeli soldiers after protest against Pence visit", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2018-01/24/c_136919909.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2018-01-24 09:31:35|Editor: Zhou Xin\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nPalestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes after a protest against the visit of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in Jerusalem, in the West Bank city of Hebron, on Jan. 23, 2018.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Bush in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, a day ahead of the state funeral for the country's 41st president.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were set to privately offer their condolences to Bush's son, former President George W. Bush, the country's 43rd president, former first lady Laura Bush and other Bush family members at Blair House, the presidential guest house across the street from the White House.\n\nTrump commented on the occasion on Twitter.\n\nTrump and his wife joined mourners at the Capitol Rotunda Monday night. They paused steps from Bush's casket for a minute, with Trump saluting and Melania Trump placing her hand over her heart, before they quietly walked away.\n\nTrump has often aimed political taunts at the Bush family, long a symbol of the traditional, more moderate wing of the U.S. Republican party that often is at odds with Trump's populist supporters. The elder Bush never warmed to Trump and voted for Trump's 2016 challenger, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut Trump wrote members of Congress to hail Bush as a man who \"led a life that exemplified what is truly great about America. President Bush worked selflessly throughout his long life to bring about a world of justice and lasting peace.\"\n\nBefore the public started walking past Bush's casket, U.S. political dignitaries praised him as an American hero in World War II, a statesman, a world leader and, perhaps most of all, as a decent man full of grace. Bush died last week at the age of 94 at his home in Texas after years of failing health.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said \"President Bush was a great leader who made a great difference in the life of this nation. But he was also just a good man, who was devoted to his wife, his family and his friends.\" Pence said there was a kindness about Bush \"that was evident to everyone who ever met him.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said America stands with the Bush family \"in mourning but also in gratitude. Gratitude for lives well-lived and duties thoroughly fulfilled.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said \"here lies a great man, a gentle soul. ... His legacy is grace perfected.\"\n\nThe public viewing of Bush's casket extends until early Wednesday when the casket will be transported to Washington National Cathedral for the state funeral.\n\nThe Episcopal service will include four eulogies, from Bush's son, the former president, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Evan Meacham, who wrote a biography of Bush. The Trumps are attending the funeral but are not expected to speak.\n\nWhat does it mean to lie in state?\n\n\u200bPolitical analyst Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia said Bush's stature among the country's 45 presidents has grown in the quarter century since he left office.\n\n\"It's pretty obvious as people look back, and as people are recollecting the Bush presidency, it looks a heck of a lot better than it did at the end of it,\" Sabato told VOA. \"Bush, of course, was defeated for re-election, and most people at the time considered him a failed president\" because of a recession during his time in the White House.\n\n\"But now, I think we can see in retrospect that he was actually quite successful,\" Sabato said, particularly in foreign affairs, as he helped shape the Western response to the demise of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany. He also led the U.S. to a military victory in reversing Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait.\n\nMoreover, Sabato said, Bush benefits from a comparison with Trump's demeanor nearly halfway through the current president's first term in the White House.\n\n\"To be honest, at one point in history,' Sabato said, \"it would not have been exceptional to have a president who obeyed and appreciated the norms of the American system and of the presidency, who was civil, who was kind to people and who rose above petty squabbles. But you know, things have changed, particularly in the last couple years. And the contrast between George H.W. Bush and the current president could not be more stark.\"\n\nTrump has designated Wednesday as a national day of mourning in Bush's honor. The New York Stock Exchange will be closed, as are most government offices."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Biden Says He's the 'Most Qualified' to Be President'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-i-m-the-most-qualified-person-in-the-country-to-be-president-/4686257.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said Monday night whether he makes a White House run in 2020 will depend on whether he and his family are \u201cready,\u201d though he stressed his credentials.\n\n\"I think I\u2019m the most qualified person in the country to be president,\u201d Biden told an audience in Missoula, Montana, on a stop to promote his book \"Promise Me, Dad.\u201d \u201cThe issues that we face as a country today are the issues that I\u2019ve worked on my whole life \u2014 the plight of the middle class and foreign policy.

Outgoing Airbus CEO Tom Enders said the two firms made \"a great industry team.\"\n\nMilitaries rely on tankers - which are essentially flying gas stations - to extend their reach by refueling combat aircraft during military exercises or military missions. Demand has grown given the large number of longer-range military\n\noperations underway around the world.\n\nAirbus is banking on the international success of its A330-based Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), which has been selected by 12 countries, including Australia, Britain and South Korea. The aircraft is already refueling or capable of refueling most major U.S. combat airplanes, including the stealthy F-35 fighter jet.\n\nLockheed, builder of the F-35 and the C-130J transport plane that can also be used as a tanker, will give Airbus a strong partner for future U.S. bids, the companies said. \"This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise,\" said Michele Evans, the new head of\n\nLockheed's aeronautics division.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force, which wants to ultimately replace its entire fleet of over 400 tankers, is examining ways to meet growing demand for aerial refueling with possible fee-for-service arrangements, purchases of hundreds of additional aircraft, and the future development of a stealthy tanker.\n\nSenior executives from Airbus and Lockheed agreed in Madrid to jointly explore all those opportunities, but are still working on details of their future cooperation, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\n(1 euro = $1.1351)"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Envoy for Afghan Peace in Pakistan for Talks on Taliban", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-for-afghan-peace-in-pakistan-for-talks-on-taliban/4686239.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Washington's special envoy tasked with finding a negotiated end to Afghanistan's bloody 17-year-old war met Tuesday with Pakistani officials, and a Taliban official said four members from the group's political office in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar were also in the Pakistani capital.\n\nBut the visit by the Taliban leaders, which included a former Taliban ambassador and a former governor who is also on a United Nations sanctions list, is \"private,\" the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nPakistan routinely tells a grumbling Washington that its influence over the Taliban is exaggerated, yet in the past have exhibited sufficient sway over the insurgent movement to summon their leaders to Pakistan for quiet talks.\n\nOn this occasion, the Taliban official told the AP, the group's Qatar office sent Shaha-ud-din Dilawar, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia; Zia-ur-Rahman Madani, former governor of Logar province who is on the U.N. sanctions list for providing funding for the Taliban; Suhail Shaheen, a former diplomat and Sala Hanafi.\n\nThere was no indication who the four might meet or how long they would stay in Pakistan but it was expected their visit would be a prelude to further discussions in Qatar when Zalmay Khalilzad visits later this month.\n\nThe resurgent Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan before U.S. forces invaded in October 2001, carry out near-daily attacks on Afghan army and police forces. They view the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as a dysfunctional Western puppet and have refused repeated offers to negotiate with it.\n\nU.S. and NATO troops formally concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan in 2014, but still provide close support to Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations. Some 15,000 American forces are currently serving in Afghanistan.\n\nSince his appointment in September, U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has accelerated efforts to find an Afghan peace pact that would allow for the eventual withdrawal of the United States from its longest war, which has already cost Washington nearly $1 trillion.\n\nKhalilzad will also travel to Afghanistan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in stepped-up efforts to find a peaceful end to the war.\n\nIn November, Khalilzad held three days of talks with the Taliban in Qatar, according to the Taliban. The United States has neither confirmed nor denied direct talks with the Taliban, a longstanding demand of the radical religious movement. Khalilzad, however, has said he has held talks with all Afghans, a sideways reference to include the Taliban.\n\nOn the eve of Khalilzad's visit to Pakistan, U.S. President Donald Trump a wrote a letter seeking Prime Minister Imrah Khan's his cooperation, even though he has been a harsh and often belligerent critic of Pakistan and even engaged in a twitter battle with Khan. Khan told reporters Monday that his government will do whatever was possible to ensure peace in Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. still has about 14,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, mostly in support and advisory roles, yet their mission continues to be deadly. Last week in eastern Afghanistan an improvised explosive device killed four U.S. troops, the deadliest attack against U.S. forces in Afghanistan since June 2017. The Taliban claimed responsibility.\n\nWashington's own Congress-appointed watchdog says the Taliban control or hold sway in nearly 50 percent of the country.\n\nStill, Khalilzad said earlier this month in Kabul that he held out hope that a peace agreement, which he referred to as a \"roadmap for the future,\" was possible between the Taliban and an Afghan government appointed team. Khalilzad even suggested it could be in place ahead of Afghanistan's scheduled presidential elections on April 20.\n\nThe spokesman for Pakistan's powerful military, Gen. Asif Ghafoor, told a briefing of foreign journalists Tuesday that Pakistan's influence over the Taliban is overstated, yet he said Pakistan has repeatedly told the insurgent group to join the peace process.\n\nHe said the release of senior Taliban officials from Pakistani prisons, including a co-founder of the movement, Mullah Ghani Baradar, was part of the peace process. Prisoner releases were also long standing demands of the Taliban.\n\nGhafoor also cautioned against a hurried U.S. retreat from Afghanistan that leaves behind a vacuum, warning it would result in chaos. He said a peaceful Afghanistan was in the interest of Pakistan, saying Afghanistan is one of the few countries with which Pakistan has a trade surplus.\n\nGhafoor also said that until 2014 the Pakistan military, which has lost more soldiers than NATO and the United States combined fighting the anti-terror war, was focused on battling its own insurgents, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ignored demands to widen the war to include Afghan insurgents, including the Haqqani network.\n\nBut after 2014, he said the Pakistan army launched its operation in the North Waziristan tribal area to rid the area of foreign insurgents, including Afghan Taliban and Uzbek insurgents, but when they fled across the border into Afghanistan the U.S. and Afghan forces failed to corral them.\n\nPakistan has begun construction on a 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) fence along its border with Afghanistan, a move that has infuriated Afghans, who still dispute the border known as the Durand line that separates Pakistan and Afghanistan."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump: Trade Talks With China Underway", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-if-no-china-trade-deal-possible-i-am-a-tariff-man-/4686228.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. President Donald Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday that talks to secure a trade deal with China \"have already started\" and if a \"fair deal\" is reached, \"I will happily sign it.\"\n\nTrump's comments come after leaders of the world's two biggest economies agreed Saturday in Argentina to not impose any new tariffs on each other's exports for the next 90 days while they negotiate a detailed trade agreement.\n\n\n\nTrump declared himself Tuesday \"a Tariff Man\" who wants \"people or countries\" with intentions to \"raid the great wealth\" of the U.S. \"to pay for the privilege of doing so.\"\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier this week the U.S. won Chinese commitments to buy more than $1 trillion in American products.\n\nThe U.S. had a $335.4 billion trade deficit with China in 2017.

Kennedy's \"Profiles in Courage\" came out in 1955, when he was in his late 30s, and its sketches of political figures who made unpopular decisions presented him as a serious thinker who, like his subjects, would risk his career for the right cause.\n\nSen. John McCain's career was influenced, in part, by his acclaimed memoir \"Faith of My Fathers,\" which came out in 1999, around the time of his first presidential run. It marked the first time he wrote at length about his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, which helped define his public identity.\n\n\n\nThe deeply personal exploration of race in Barack Obama's \"Dreams from My Father\" propelled him onto the national scene when it was republished during his 2004 Senate campaign.

If a book is well-written, he said, \"it's like selling out a theater with a two-hour biopic about your life that's directed by you and starring you, the politician.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of advantages for both the publisher and for the candidate to have a book as a narrative product,\" he added. \"They can't control what The Washington Post and The New York Times and Fox News is going to say about them, but they can control what's between the covers.\"\n\n\n\nWith book authorship comes the opportunity for would-be candidates to travel to promote not only their book but also their strategy for the country, said Michael Steel, who was an adviser to former House Speaker John Boehner and to Jeb Bush's 2016 Republican presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\"Particularly for the higher-profile potential candidates, it's an opportunity to get out there and talk about your vision and your record \u2014 and it's particularly good because in addition to political news outlets, you can talk to softer-edged media outlets,\" Steel said. \"You can go on 'The View,' you can go on the 'Today' show, you can go on radio stations across the country and talk about the book.\"\n\nGillibrand appeared on \"The View\" in November to promote her book, which contains stories of women who fought for the right to vote. In the interview, she said the book was for \"little boys and little girls to understand what leadership looks like.\"\n\n\n\nAs expected, she was asked about her own aspirations.\n\n\n\nCalling it a \"very important moral question,\" Gillibrand told the hosts that she believed she'd been called to fight \"as hard as I possibly can\" to restore decency and integrity to the country and that she was considering a run.\n\n\n\nSteel drew a distinction between the flurry of books that are being released as candidates consider launching campaigns and the books that are released before a presidential run is officially in the works.\n\n\n\n\"The books that are written before a candidate decides to run are often far more revealing about their actual character and personality and background,\" Steel said. \"Those are also the ones that can occasionally reveal things that the person probably wouldn't have revealed if they were planning to run for president.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "White House Seeks to End Subsidies for Electric Cars, Renewables", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-seeks-to-end-subsidies-for-electric-cars-renewables/4685685.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday the Trump administration wants to end subsidies for electric cars and other items, including renewable energy sources.\n\nAsked about plans after General Motors announced U.S. plant closings and layoffs last week, Kudlow pointed to the $2,500-to-$7,500 tax credit for consumers who buy plug-in electric vehicles, including those made by GM, under federal law.\n\n\"As a matter of our policy, we want to end all of those subsidies,\" Kudlow said. \"And by the way, other subsidies that were imposed during the Obama administration, we are ending, whether it's for renewables and so forth.\"\n\nAsked about a timeline, he said: \"It's just all going to end in the near future.

Tesla said in July it had hit the threshold.\n\nOther automakers may not hit the cap for several years.\n\nExperts say the White House cannot change the cap unilaterally.

In the coming year, U.N. agencies will work with governments to strengthen their climate action plans covering the decade to 2030, as well as their long-term strategies, Guterres said.\n\nClimate experts said on Tuesday they expected countries to issue a political declaration at the end of the December 2-14 climate talks in Katowice that would firmly signal their intention to do more to cut emissions from 2020.\n\nThey should then \"sharpen their pencils\" and consult with government authorities, businesses and civil society back home to work out how to achieve that, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe world has seen \"a technology revolution since Paris,\" he said, with renewable energy generation and storage now far cheaper \u2014 something countries must make the most of in revising their 2020 plans to cut emissions.\n\nIn Katowice, government officials are hammering out rules on how to measure and track emissions reductions under the Paris deal, seeking a formula to achieve widespread and ambitious cuts that is fair to countries with fewer resources.\n\nThere are also complex discussions on how rich states should track the funding they have provided and indicate the amount they will contribute in future years \u2014 a touchy subject with some governments reluctant to make promises.\n\nGuterres said a central objective of his 2019 summit would be to provide a \"transparent approach\" to delivering $100 billion to vulnerable countries each year from 2020-2025, when a new target is due to kick in.\n\nHe urged donors to replenish the coffers of the flagship Green Climate Fund by the time of the summit, a process the fund's board has said it aims to complete by October 2019.\n\nThe summit, designed to spur political commitment to action, will also involve different groups tackling climate change, from cities and companies to young people, the U.N. said in a briefing note.\n\nThe summit aims to win promises for on-the-ground change in polluting industries from oil to cement, and target how supply chains and technology can cut emissions and waste, particularly from farming and food systems.\n\nIt also wants cities to make new commitments on low-emission buildings, mass transport and green urban infrastructure, as well as protection for poor communities such as slum dwellers.\n\n\"The summit is not an end in itself,\" Guterres said. \"It is ... a tool to leverage unprecedented ambition, transformation and mobilization.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Congo's Worst Ebola Outbreak Hits Women Especially Hard", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-worst-ebola-outbreak-hits-women-especially-hard/4686041.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "The Democratic Republic of Congo is in the throes of its worst-ever Ebola outbreak, with more than 420 cases in the country\u2019s volatile east, and a mortality rate of just under 60 percent. But this outbreak \u2014 the nation\u2019s tenth known Ebola epidemic \u2014 is unusual because more than 60 percent of patients are women.\n\nAmong them is Baby Benedicte. Her short life has already been unimaginably difficult.\n\nAt one month old, she is underweight, at 2.9 kilograms. And she is alone. Her mother had Ebola, and died giving birth to her. She\u2019s spent the last three weeks of her life in a plastic isolation cube, cut off from most human contact. She developed a fever at eight days old and was transferred to this hospital in Beni, a town of some half-million people in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMore than 400 people have been diagnosed with Ebola here since the beginning of August, and more than half of them have died in a nation the size of Western Europe that struggles with insecurity and a lack of the most basic infrastructure and services. That makes this the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history, after the hemorrhagic fever killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa between 2013 and 2016.\n\nThis is 10th outbreak to strike the vast country since 1976, when Ebola was first identified in Congo. And this particular outbreak is further complicated by a simmering civil conflict that has plagued this region for more than two decades.\n\nGuido Cornale, UNICEF\u2019s coordinator in the region, says the scope of this outbreak is clear.\n\n\u201cIt has become the worst outbreak in Congo, this is not a mystery,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat is mysterious, however, is the demographics of this outbreak. This time, more than 60 percent of cases are women, says the government\u2019s regional health coordinator, Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe.\n\n\"All the analyses show that this epidemic is feminized. Figures like this are alarming. It\u2019s true that the female cases are more numerous than the male cases,\" he said.\n\nBathe declined to predict when the outbreak might end, though international officials have said it may last another six months. Epidemiologists are still studying why this epidemic is so skewed toward women and children, Cornale said.\n\n\u201cSo now we can only guess. And one of the guesses is that woman are the caretakers of sick people at home. So if a family member got sick, who is taking care of him or her? Normally, a woman,\u201d he said.\n\nOr a nurse. Many of those affected are health workers, who are on the front line of battling this epidemic. Nurse Guilaine Mulindwa Masika, spent 16 days in care after a patient transmitted the virus to her. She says it was the fight of her life.\n\n\"The pain was enormous, the pain was constant,\" she said. \"The headache, the diarrhea, the vomiting, and the weakness \u2014 it was very, very bad.\"\n\nFor the afflicted, the road to recovery is long and lonely. Masika and her cured colleagues face weeks of leave from work to ensure the risk of infection is gone. In the main hospital in the city of Beni, families who have recovered live together in a large white tent, kept four meters from human contact by a bright orange plastic cordon. They yell hello at their caretakers, who must don protective gear if they want to get any closer.\n\nAnd for Baby Benedicte, who is tended to constantly by a nurse covered head to toe in protective gear, the future is uncertain. Medical workers aren\u2019t entirely sure where her father is, or if he is going to come for her.\n\nShe sleeps most of the day, the nurse says, untroubled by the goings-on around her.

The meter-wide, shallow channel runs the length of a football field alongside one of the port\u2019s giant parking lots.\n\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s always pretty,\u201d May corrected himself. Even the gunk. Because that gunk is removing pollution from the Chesapeake Bay. Plus, May\u2019s colleagues are turning it into clean, renewable electricity.\n\nThe Chesapeake needs the help.\n\n\u200bAlgal feast\n\nLike many waterways around the world, the bay is polluted with excess nutrients from farm fertilizer runoff, city wastewater and other sources. Algae feast on those nutrients, triggering massive growth that chokes out other aquatic life. Last summer, algal growth left an average of 4.6 cubic kilometers of the bay without oxygen.\n\nA third of the pollution reaching the bay literally falls out of the sky.\n\nFossil fuels burned in power plants, cars and elsewhere create nitrogen oxide air pollution, which ultimately ends up in the bay, either attached to airborne particles or dissolved in rainwater.\n\nForests would soak up that pollution. But like many urban areas, the Port of Baltimore has a pavement problem. There\u2019s not a tree to be found at the entire 230-hectare Dundalk Marine Terminal, where the algae scrubber is located.\n\nSo regulators require the port to remove as much pollution from the bay as its parking lots allow in. That\u2019s where the algal turf scrubber comes in.\n\nPutting algae to work\n\nThe scrubber is like \u201ca controlled algal bloom on land,\u201d May said, \u201cwhich puts the algae to work pulling nutrients out of the water.\u201d\n\nThe city of Durham, N.C., is planning to build another scrubber to clean up a local reservoir. A pilot study found it would cost about half as much as typical pollution control measures, such as constructed wetlands, and much less than retrofitting existing systems. Others are up and running in Florida.\n\nThe algal turf scrubber creates one big challenge, May said.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with that algae? You have to have an end use or else you\u2019re going to pile that algae up very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. It\u2019s been turned into animal feed. It can be fermented into biofuels. Some of May\u2019s colleagues have used it to launch a fertilizer business.\n\nBut here at the Port of Baltimore, they\u2019re turning it into electricity.\n\nDigesting for power\n\nMay works with University of Maryland colleague Stephanie Lansing, an expert in a process called anaerobic digestion. It\u2019s not much different from our own digestion.\n\n\u201cYou have bacteria in your gut that break down food. We\u2019re doing that same process in an anaerobic digester,\u201d Lansing said. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking down the material, and we\u2019re producing energy in the process.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the microbes digesting the algae produce methane biogas. The biogas runs a fuel cell.\n\n\u201cThe fuel cell is actually a very efficient way to use the energy,\u201d she said. This small, pilot system produces a modest amount of electricity.\n\n\u201cYou can use it to charge batteries. You can use it for lights. You can use it for fans,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Port of Baltimore plans to build a larger system that will cover about a third of a hectare, which could produce a few hundred kilowatts \u2014 still modest, but not bad, when you start with just polluted water and algae.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an entire cycle where you\u2019re dealing with not only a water pollution problem, but an air pollution issue,\u201d Lansing said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "First Global Women's Disability Award Aims to Break Stereotypes", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/first-global-women-disability-award-aims-to-break-stereotypes/4685662.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The first global award recognizing the achievements of women with disabilities aims to break through stereotypes to show their skills as leaders and problem solvers, its founder said Monday.\n\nA filmmaker, a political campaigner and a public health expert were named the first winners of the Her Ability awards, which were announced to coincide with World Disability Day.\n\nIts founder, Ethiopian campaigner Yetnebersh Nigussie, said she wanted to put a spotlight on disabled women's achievements to combat the idea that they are passive victims.\n\n\"We really wanted to change that image and cherish their abilities and their victories,\" Nigussie, who lost her sight at age five, told Reuters.\n\n\"In order to change things, people need to really see our abilities and our problem-solving skills that we have developed through life by overcoming attitudinal as well as physical and policy barriers everywhere.\"\n\nMore than a billion people \u2014 about 15 percent of the world's population \u2014 have some form of disability, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWomen with disabilities have been recognized as doubly vulnerable by experts, who say they face additional barriers.\n\nThe first winners of the awards, which were set up by Nigussie and the global disability organization Light for the World, all came from the developing world.\n\nThey included Toyin Janet Aderemi, the first Nigerian wheelchair-user to study and practice pharmacy, who was recognized for her work on disability-inclusive health and as a lobbyist for disability rights.\n\nShe lost the ability to walk due to a childhood bout of polio and had to be carried on her mother's back until she got her first wheelchair at age 15.\n\n\"Winning this award showcases what is possible and how society starts to benefit when you are able to educate a girl child with a disability,\" Aderemi said.\n\n\"Attitudes are changing but very slowly. ...

But overcoming the regulatory hurdles and safety issues posed by drones appears to be a challenge even for the world\u2019s wealthiest man. The result is a blown deadline on his claim to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in December 2013 that drones would be making deliveries within five years.\n\nThe day may not be far off when drones will carry medicine to people in rural or remote areas, but the marketing hype around instant delivery of consumer goods looks more and more like just that \u2014 hype. Drones have a short battery life, and privacy concerns can be a hindrance, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you will see delivery of burritos or diapers in the suburbs,\u201d says drone analyst Colin Snow.\n\nDrone usage has grown rapidly in some industries, but mostly outside the retail sector and direct interaction with consumers.\n\nThe government estimates that about 110,000 commercial drones are operating in U.S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022. They are being used in rural areas for mining and agriculture, for inspecting power lines and pipelines, and for surveying.\n\nAmazon says it is still pushing ahead with plans to use drones for quick deliveries, though the company is staying away from fixed timelines.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to making our goal of delivering packages by drones in 30 minutes or less a reality,\u201d says Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish. The Seattle-based online retail giant says it has drone development centers in the United States, Austria, France, Israel and the United Kingdom.\n\nDelivery companies have been testing the use of drones to deliver emergency supplies and to cover ground quickly in less populated areas. By contrast, package deliveries would be concentrated in office parks and neighborhoods where there are bigger issues around safety and privacy.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration approved a three-year program for private companies and local government agencies to test drones for deliveries, inspections and other tasks.\n\nBut pilot programs by major delivery companies suggest few Americans will be greeted by package-bearing drones any time soon. United Parcel Service tested launching a drone from a delivery truck that was covering a rural route in Florida. DHL Express, the German delivery company, tested the use of drones to deliver medicine from Tanzania to an island in Lake Victoria.\n\nFrank Appel, the CEO of DHL\u2019s parent company, Deutsche Post AG, said \u201cover the next couple of years\u201d drones will remain a niche vehicle and not widely used. He said a big obstacle is battery life.\n\n\u201cIf you have to recharge them every other hour, then you need so many drones and you have to orchestrate that. So good luck with that,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nAppel said human couriers have another big advantage over drones: They know where customers live and which doorbell to ring. \u201cTo program that in IT is not that easy and not cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts say it will take years for the Federal Aviation Administration to write all the rules to allow widespread drone deliveries.\n\nSnow, the CEO of Skylogic Research, says a rule permitting operators to fly drones beyond their line of sight \u2014 so critical to deliveries \u2014 is at least 10 years away. A method will be needed to let law enforcement identify drones flying over people \u2014 federal officials are worried about their use by terrorists.\n\nWhile the rules are being written, companies will rely on waivers from the FAA to keep experimenting and running small-scale pilot programs.\n\n\u201cPeople like DHL and the rest of them (will say), \u2018Hey, we can deliver via drone this parcel package to this island,\u2019 but that\u2019s not the original vision that Amazon presented,\u201d Snow says.\n\nThere is a long list of FAA rules governing drone flights. They generally can\u2019t fly higher than 400 feet, over many federal facilities, or within five miles of an airport. Night flights are forbidden. For the delivery business, the most biggest holdup is that the machines must remain within sight of the operator at all times.\n\nIn June, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine said the FAA\u2019s was being overly conservative in its safety standards for drones. The group said FAA\u2019s risk-averse attitude was holding back beneficial uses, such as drones helping firefighters who are battling a fierce blaze.\n\nEven before the criticism by the scientific panel, the FAA had begun to respond more quickly to operators\u2019 requests for waivers from some rules, says Alan Perlman, founder of the Drone Pilot Ground School in Nashville, Tennessee. He said it is also getting easier and cheaper to buy liability insurance.\n\nBezos was mindful of the safety issues, telling \u201c60 Minutes\u201d back in 2013, \u201cThis thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head while they're walking around their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from predicting that drones fed with GPS coordinates would be taking off and making deliveries in \u201cfour, five years. I think so. It will work, and it will happen.\u201d\n\nTo Perlman, the billionaire\u2019s optimism made perfect sense.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in his world you think more about technology than regulations, and the (drone) technology is there,\u201d Perlman said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Can Artificial Intelligence Make Doctors Better?", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/can-artificial-intelligence-make-doctors-better/4682459.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Teacher Rishi Rawat has one student who is not human, but a machine.\n\nLessons take place at a lab inside the University of Southern California\u2019s (USC) Clinical Science Center in Los Angeles, where Rawat teaches artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nTo help the machine learn, Rawat feeds the computer samples of cancer cells.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a computer brain, and you can put the data into them and they will learn the patterns and the pattern recognition that\u2019s important to making decisions,\u201d he explained.\n\nAI may soon be a useful tool in health care and allow doctors to understand biology and diagnose disease in ways that were never humanly possible.\n\n\u200bDoctors not going away\n\n\u201cMachines are not going to take the place of doctors.

The type of treatment depends on the type of cancer and whether the tumor is driven by estrogen. Currently, pathologists would take a thin piece of tissue, put it on a slide, and stain with color to better see the cells.\n\n\u201cWhat the pathologist has to do is to count what percentage of the cells are brown and what percentage are not,\u201d said Dan Ruderman, a physicist who is also assistant professor of research medicine at USC.\n\nThe process could take days or even longer. Scientists say artificial intelligence can do something better than just count cells. Through machine learning, it can recognize complicated patterns on how the cells are arranged, with the hope, in the near future of making a quick and more reliable diagnosis that is free of human error.\n\n\u201cAre they disordered? Are they in a regular spacing?

By comparison, last year\u2019s Equifax hack affected more than 145 million people. A Target breach in 2013 affected more than 41 million payment card accounts and exposed contact information for more than 60 million customers.\n\nEspecially sensitive data\n\nBut the target here \u2014 hotels where high-stakes business deals, romantic trysts and espionage are daily currency \u2014 makes the data gathered especially sensitive.\n\nJesse Varsalone, a University of Maryland cybersecurity expert, said the affected reservation system could be extremely enticing to nation-state spies interested in the travels of military and senior government officials.\n\n\u201cThere are just so many things you can extrapolate from people staying at hotels,\u201d Varsalone said.\n\nAnd because the data included reservations for future stays, along with home addresses, burglars could learn when someone wouldn\u2019t be home, said Scott Grissom of LegalShield, a provider of legal services.\n\nStarwood brand hotels\n\nThe affected hotel brands were operated by Starwood before it was acquired by Marriott in 2016. They include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, The Luxury Collection, Le Meridien and Four Points. Starwood-branded timeshare properties were also affected. None of the Marriott-branded chains were threatened.\n\nEmail notifications for those who may have been affected begin rolling out Friday and the full scope of the breach was not immediately clear.\n\nMarriott was trying to determine if the purloined records included duplicates, such as a single person staying multiple times.\n\nBreach undetected for a while\n\nSecurity analysts were especially alarmed to learn of the breach\u2019s undetected longevity. Marriott said it first detected it Sept. 8 but was unable to determine until last week what data had possibly been exposed because the thieves used encryption to remove it in order to avoid detection.\n\nMarriott said it did not yet know how many credit card numbers might have been stolen. A spokeswoman said Saturday that it was not yet able to respond to questions such as whether the intrusion and data theft was committed by a single or multiple groups.\n\nCybersecurity expert Andrei Barysevich of Recorded Future said Saturday he believed the breach was financially motivated.\n\nThe cybercrime gang expert in credit card theft such as the eastern European group known as Fin7 could be a suspect, he said, noting that a dark web credit card vendor recently announced that 2.6 million cards stolen from an unnamed hotel chain would soon be available to the online criminal underworld.\n\n\u201cWe will have to wait until an official forensic report, although, Marriott may never share their findings openly,\u201d he said.\n\nMarriott said the stolen credit card information was encrypted but the hackers may have obtained the \u201ctwo components needed to decrypt the payment card numbers.\u201d It said it cannot \u201crule out the possibility that both were taken.\u201d\n\nPrivacy laws\n\nFor as many as two-thirds of those affected, the exposed data could include mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers. Also dates of birth, gender, reservation dates, arrival and departure times and Starwood Preferred Guest account information.\n\nThe breach of personal information could put Marriott in violation of new European privacy laws, as guests included European travelers.\n\nMarriott set up a website and call center for customers who believe they are at risk.\n\nThe FBI said anyone contacted by Marriott should \u201ctake steps to monitor and safeguard their personally identifiable information and report any suspected instances of identity theft to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov.\u201d\n\nPassport numbers have previously been part of a hack, though it\u2019s not common. They were among records on 9.4 million passengers of Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific obtained in a breach announced in October.\n\nCombined with names, addresses and other personal information, passport numbers are a greater concern than stolen credit card numbers because thieves could use them to open fraudulent accounts, said analyst Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com.\n\nHotels long a source of information\n\nThe data purloining highlights just how dangerous hotels can be for people worried about their privacy.\n\n\u201cHotels have long been important government sources of local information for tracking foreigners: reservation systems and loyalty programs took the surveillance global and made it easier for us to give up our privacy,\u201d said Colin Bastable, CEO of Lucy Security.\n\nIntelligence agencies including the U.S. National Security are well plugged into the global travel industry \u201cby fair means or foul,\u201d he said, nongovernment cybercriminals now have the same hacking tools.\n\n\u201cConsumers have become collateral damage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are all consumers.\u201d He advises providing hotels with as little information as possible when making reservations and checking in.\n\nLast year, the cybersecurity firm FireEye highlighted an effort in which Russian state agents allegedly tried to infiltrate the reservation systems of hotels in Europe and the Middle East.\n\n21 million Starwood program members\n\nWhen its acquisition by Marriott was first announced in 2015, Starwood had 21 million people in its loyalty program. The company manages more than 6,700 properties across the globe, most in North America.\n\nMarriott, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a regulatory filing that it was too early to say what financial impact the breach might have on the company. It said it has cyber insurance and is working with its carriers to assess coverage.\n\nElected officials were quick to call for action.\n\nThe New York attorney general opened an investigation.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner said the U.S. needs laws that limit the data companies can collect on customers and ensure that companies account for security costs rather than making consumers \u201cshoulder the burden and harms resulting from these lapses.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Microsoft Surpasses Apple as Most Valuable Public Company", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/microsoft-surpasses-apple-as-most-valuable-public-company/4682375.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Microsoft's big bet on cloud computing is paying off as the company has surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company.\n\n\n\nThe software maker's prospects looked bleak just a few years ago, as licenses for the company's Windows system fell with a sharp drop in sales of personal computers.\n\n\n\nBut under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has found stability by focusing on software and services over the internet, or the cloud, with long-term business contracts.\n\n\n\nThat 1990s personal-computing powerhouse is now having a renaissance moment, as it eclipses Facebook, Google, Amazon and the other tech darlings of the late decade.\n\n\n\nApple had been the world's most prosperous firm since claiming the top spot from Exxon Mobil earlier this decade. Microsoft surpassed Apple briefly a few times this week, but didn't close on top until Friday, with a market value of $851 billion to Apple's $847 billion. Microsoft hadn't been at the top since the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.\n\nApple's plunge\n\n\n\nMicrosoft became a contender again in large part because Apple's stock fell nearly 20 percent in November, while Microsoft hasn't done any worse than the rest of the stock market. But the fact that it hasn't done poorly reflects its steady focus on business customers in recent years.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft lost its luster as people were shunning PCs in favor of smartphones. In 2013, PC sales plunged 10 percent to about 315 million, the worst year-to-year drop ever, according to research firms Gartner and IDC. It didn't help that Microsoft's effort to make PCs more like phones, Windows 8, was widely panned.\n\n\n\nBut a turnaround began when the Redmond, Wash., company promoted Nadella as CEO in 2014. He succeeded Microsoft's longtime CEO, Steve Ballmer, who initially scoffed at the notion that people would be willing to pay $500 or more for Apple's iPhones.\n\nThat bet paid off. Windows is now a dwindling fraction of Microsoft's business. While the company still runs consumer-focused businesses such as Bing search and Xbox gaming, it has prioritized business-oriented services such as its Office line of email and other workplace software, as well as newer additions such as LinkedIn and Skype. But its biggest growth has happened in the cloud, particularly the cloud platform it calls Azure. Cloud computing now accounts for more than a quarter of Microsoft's revenue, and Microsoft rivals Amazon as a leading provider of such services.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said Azure is still in its early days, meaning there's plenty of room for growth, especially considering the company's large customer base for Office and other products.\n\n\n\n\"While the tech carnage seen over the last month has been brutal, shares of [Microsoft] continue to hold up like the Rock of Gibraltar,'' he said.\n\n\n\nBeing less reliant on consumer demand helped shield Microsoft from holiday season turbulence and U.S.-China trade war jitters affecting Apple and other tech companies.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump amplified those tariff concerns when he told The Wall Street Journal in a story published late Monday that new tariffs could affect iPhones and laptops imported from China.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone maker had already seen its stock fall after reporting a mixed bag of quarterly results in early November amid fears about how the technology industry will fare in the face of such threats as rising interest rates, increased government regulation and Trump's escalating trade war with China.\n\nReporting change\n\n\n\nApple also spooked investors with an unexpected decision to stop disclosing how many iPhones it sells each quarter. That move has been widely interpreted as a sign that Apple foresees further declines in iPhone sales and is trying to mask that.\n\n\n\nWhile smartphones caused the downturn in personal computers years ago, sales of smartphones themselves have now stalled. That's partly because with fewer innovations from previous models, more people choose to hold on to the devices for longer periods before upgrading.\n\n\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager for Synovus Trust, said Microsoft is outperforming its tech rivals in part because of what it's not. It doesn't face as much regulatory scrutiny as advertising-hungry Google and Facebook, which have attracted controversy over their data-harvesting practices. Unlike Netflix, it's not on a hunt for a diminishing number of international subscribers. And while Amazon also has a strong cloud business, it's still more dependent on online retail."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "This Professor Teaches Journalism At A Top UK University.

An extensive investigation by the The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the US Government science laboratory, debunked many of these claims in 2005.\n\nIn his review, Robinson calls the book \u201ca serious challenge for mainstream academics and journalists to start to ask substantial questions about 9/11\u2033 in order to \u201csearch for the facts and speak truth to power\u201d.\n\nRobinson also provided a quote for the back cover of the book, writing: \u201c9/11 Unmasked provides an authoritative and carefully argued exposition of key problems with the official narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by HuffPost UK if he agrees with the conclusions of 9/11 Unmasked, Robinson said in an email: \u201cMy position, as has been the case for some time, is that [conclusions detailed in 9/11 Unmasked] demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that significant parts of the official narrative are very likely to be incorrect.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer tenable for academics and journalists to avoid asking probing questions about the possible involvement of state actors in the 9/11 attacks. 9/11 requires further analysis and investigation and this is a position I share with many other academics.\u201d\n\nRobinson also suggested a number of other academics whose work would allow readers to \u201cget up to speed with geo-politics and the current dynamics of the international system\u201d, one of whom was Kees van der Pijl, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex.\n\nEarlier this month van der Pijl tweeted: \u201cNot Saudis, Israelis blew up Twin Towers with help from Zionists in US govt.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nLydia Wilson, an Oxford and Cambridge research fellow and editor of the Cambridge Literary Review, said this raises serious questions for the University of Sheffield.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that Piers Robinson is teaching propaganda,\u201d she told HuffPost UK. \u201cThe most troubling thing for me is how did he get this job? It\u2019s not hard to uncover this man.\n\n\u2033[The review of 9/11 Unmasked] is conspiracy-theory driven. There\u2019s no academic who should write a post like \u2013 there\u2019s no argument and there\u2019s no evidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to students \u2013 he\u2019s working in a journalism department and he can\u2019t analyse journalism sources.\u201d\n\nRobinson has taught at the University of Sheffield since last year, HuffPost UK understands that his inaugural lecture to students in October 2017 was based on a paper he published around the same time, titled \u201cLearning from the Chilcot report: Propaganda, deception and the \u2019War on Terror\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis paper argues that the ongoing conflict in Syria, which began in 2011, is not the result of the popular uprising known as the Arab Spring, but is in fact the \u201cconsequence\u201d of policies made by former leaders George Bush and Tony Blair in reaction to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nYes, ignorance of the larger picture: Syria is just one regime change in a series initiated after 9/11. Read the article, or Chilcot 3.1 \u2014 Piers Robinson (@PiersRobinson1) July 5, 2017\n\nRobinson uses a number of quotes from the Chilcot Report \u2013 the public inquiry into the origins of the Iraq War, which was published in 2017 \u2013 and other sources, to make the case that the current war in Syria is part of a regime-change plot by western governments, supported by an extensive propaganda campaign aimed at the public.\n\nIn one instance during his lecture and paper, he quotes Blair as saying \u201cthe Middle east is set for catastrophe\u201d as \u201cindicative evidence\u201d the former prime minister knew the region would be embroiled in \u201cbig and significant\u201d western-backed conflict a decade later.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson stood by his interpretation, saying: \u201cRemember Blair and Bush are planning the overthrow of Saddam [Hussein] in these documents plus discussing when to \u2018hit\u2019 Iran and Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the next page of the Chilcot Report, which he does not show to his students, shows Blair was actually discussing offering Iran and Syria \u201chelp and support in building a new partnership with the West\u201d.\n\nDr Yasser Munif, a Lebanese expert on middle eastern politics and society at Emerson College, Boston, told HuffPost UK: \u201cRobinson and people like him are trying to transpose what happened in the Iraq War onto what\u2019s happening with the Arab uprisings of 2011.\n\n\u201cOne of the major problems with his thinking is he completely denies the agency of the Arab population, perceives anything happening in the region as a form of conspiracy.\n\n\u201cHe thinks Arabs have to be manipulated and funded and told exactly what to do \u2013 it\u2019s completely insulting.\u201d\n\nA major part of Robinson\u2019s case for arguing the Syrian war is part of a western regime plot, is a quote from US General Wesley Clark, made in 2006.\n\nAt the time, he described a 2001 encounter with a Pentagon official who alluded to a plan to \u201ctake out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off with Iraq\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson claims in his lecture and paper that General Clark was \u201cwas more or less right on the money\u201d and says it is further evidence the conflict in Syria began as part of a western regime change plot.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK spoke to General Clark and informed him of how Robinson was using his quote, he said: \u201cTell him to stop \u2013 the document was written in 2001 so I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Syria in 2011.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t a western regime-change issue.\u201d\n\nRobinson also uses another quote in both his lecture and paper, from a speech by the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove.\n\nSpeaking at the Rusi think-tank in 2014, he describes a pre-9/11 conversation with Saudi Prince Bandar, who told him: \u201cThe time is not far off, Richard, in the Middle East when it will literally be God help the Shia, more than 69 million Sunnis have simply had enough of them\u201d.\n\nPiers Robinson/YouTube A slide from Robinson's inaugural lecture at the University of Sheffield.\n\nRobinson presents this as further evidence the middle east will be hit by a series of western-backed wars.\n\nBut the next part of Dearlove\u2019s speech, which Robinson does not play to his students, makes clear he is talking about possible Saudi funding for Islamic State, not regime change, as explained by journalist Patrick Cockburn.\n\nWhen HuffPost UK informed Dearlove of how Robinson was using his quote, he told us: \u201d[He] is wildly misinterpreting me.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural lecture to journalism students, HuffPost UK has also learned that Robinson claims the infamous \u201cMISSION ACCOMPLISHED\u201d banner that hung behind George W Bush when he made his speech declaring the Iraq War over in 2003 was \u201cwas actually imposed over, it wasn\u2019t actually there\u201d.\n\nIn his email to HuffPost UK, Robinson elaborated saying he believed it was \u201cimposed via computer programming overlay in real time, like they do with adverts at football matches and so on\u201d.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Robinson says the banner \"imposed via computer programming overlay\".\n\nRobinson is also a public speaker and regularly shares a stage with and promotes the work of:\n\nMedia on Trial Promotional material from a \"Media on Trial\" event held in London last year. Syrian activists who protested the event were harangued by attendees and accused of working for Israel and the Pentagon.\n\nNader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver, told HuffPost UK: \u201cPiers Robinson and his friends have no interest in truth or justice, they have an interest in propaganda and their propaganda is rooted in a particular worldview that stems from the belief that the only evil in the world comes from the West.\n\n\u201cThe administrators of the university that he teaches at have to be presented with this evidence.\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s supposed to be objective and teaching propaganda is himself a propagandist.\u201d\n\nA University of Sheffield spokesperson, told HuffPost UK: \u201cAcademics in our community share, scrutinise and debate a range of different views based on their areas of research."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Where Is He Jiankui?

Ditching them could be a major embarrassment as governments meet in Poland to try to pin down measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming.\n\nHowever, over the past three weeks the protests have evolved into a wider anti-Macron uprising, with many criticizing the president for pursuing policies they say favor the rich and do nothing to help the working poor.\n\nDespite mostly peaceful nationwide demonstrations, the protests have turned violent on successive weekends in Paris.

Discontent has steadily risen among blue-collar workers and the middle-class struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to push ahead with an increase in fuel taxes from January, part of a longer-term effort to discourage fossil fuel use, angered people in rural or outer urban areas who use their cars more.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if suspending the tax rise would be enough to placate the \u201cyellow vests\u201d or head off a repeat of the violence that erupted in Paris on Saturday, which officials said was driven by extreme groups on the far-left and far-right, such as the Black bloc and anarchist factions.\n\nThe U-turn could also undermine Macron\u2019s credentials as a \u201cnew style\u201d president willing to shake up France.\n\nHe has said repeatedly that he will not back down but with his ratings barely above 20 percent and with other major changes in the pipeline, including pensions reform, party officials say he needs to find a way of cooling the turbulent atmosphere.\n\nHe is also aware that the anti-establishment fervor spurring the yellow vests on could spell trouble in next year\u2019s European election.\n\nMacron has described that election as a battle between progressives like himself and populists on the far-right and the far-left, who have made recent gains in the polls on the back of the popular discontent."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "David Attenborough's Dire Climate Warning: \u2018Our Greatest Threat In Thousands Of Years'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-attenborough-climate-change-un_us_5c05f432e4b066b5cfa4e91b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "David Attenborough, the famed naturalist and conservation advocate, issued a dire warning for the world during a speech at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate summit on Monday: Act now, or the natural world, humanity included, may soon collapse.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re facing a man-made disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,\u201d Attenborough, 92, said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\u201d\n\nThe comments came at the beginning of a two-week climate conference in Katowice, Poland, where emissaries from nearly 200 nations are meeting to determine how the world can dramatically scale back greenhouse gas emissions to abide by the landmark Paris climate agreement and, by doing so, stave off the worst effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s people have spoken.

The effects would include a mass die-off of coral reefs and an increase in extreme weather events. The world is working to implement the commitments made under the Paris Agreement but is still far off track from preventing catastrophic levels of warming.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump has regularly denied the existence of climate change and its links to humanity.

All three documents are expected to yield significant new details on what cooperation the three of them provided to the Russia investigation.\n\nThere has been much speculation that Mueller might file his memo in Manafort\u2019s case under seal in order to prevent public disclosure of the additional crimes his office believes Manafort committed when he allegedly lied to prosecutors and broke a plea deal after agreeing to cooperate.\n\nBut Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel, confirmed to Yahoo News on Monday that the Manafort memo \u201cwill be public,\u201d although he added there could be some portions that are redacted or filed as a sealed addendum. The Manafort memo has been requested by the federal judge in his case so that prosecutors could, for the first time, spell out what matters they believe Manafort has lied to them about.\n\nThe fact that Mueller is planning a public filing about Manafort suggests he may no longer feel the need to withhold information about his case in order to bring additional indictments against others. That would be consistent with messages his prosecutors have given defense lawyers in recent weeks indicating that they are in the endgame of their investigation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been telling people they are tying up loose ends and trying to conclude,\u201d said one source familiar with the communications between Mueller\u2019s office and defense lawyers who represent key witnesses in the case.\n\nThat message was reinforced to some degree Monday when Mueller\u2019s office talked to congressional investigators as part of an ongoing discussion about whether new subpoenas for testimony by House and Senate committees might interfere with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe response, which surprised one investigator, was that it would not, at least in matters relating to alleged obstruction by the White House in the Russia investigation itself. \u201cWhat we were told is that the investigation has reached a mature enough stage that they\u2019ve basically talked to everybody they want to talk to,\u201d said a knowledgeable source who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nMueller\u2019s office declined any public comment when asked to confirm that account, leaving open the possibility that there still could be a few witnesses yet to be questioned. Another source indicated that Mueller\u2019s office is still asking congressional investigators to stay away from some other witnesses. But if true, the response on Monday could also be an indication that the special counsel does not plan to press for a face-to-face interview with President Trump, who submitted written responses to Mueller\u2019s team in mid-November on matters relating to the Russia probe. The president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy all accounts, last week\u2019s guilty plea by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was one of Mueller\u2019s more significant documents. It revealed that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Cohen was in direct discussion with an assistant to Dmitri Peskov, the press secretary for Russian President Vladimir Putin, about securing financing and land for the construction of a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen told Mueller\u2019s prosecutors that he briefed Trump about the plans on multiple occasions and that discussions about the Moscow skyscraper continued until June 2016 \u2014 six months after he previously had told Congress he pulled the plug on the project.\n\nCohen is due to be sentenced in federal court in New York next week. While Mueller has not yet filed a sentencing memo in that case, Cohen\u2019s lawyers have asked that he avoid jail entirely, and Mueller\u2019s sentencing memo is due Friday. The president, meanwhile, offered his own suggestion \u2014 that his former lawyer should be jailed and \u201cserve a full and complete sentence\u201d \u2014 in a tweetstorm early Monday.\n\nThe only other publicly known matter Mueller is believed to be focused on relates to former Trump adviser Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi \u2014 both of whom have been aggressively investigated to determine if they had advance communications with WikiLeaks or associates of the group about its plans for the release of stolen emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n_____"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Hilarious Supercut Shows Donald Trump Wandering Off During Important Events", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-walking-away-supercut_us_5c06486ce4b07aec57521b6a", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he walked off stage after greeting Argentinian President Mauricio Macri at the G-20 summit on Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Trump has gone off-piste during important events, as this supercut from Now This News demonstrates:"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "The Longest-Serving Congressman In History Wants To Abolish The Senate", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-dingell-abolish-the-senate_us_5c06a02be4b0cd916fb06ea4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "A man who served Congress for more than 59 years says he could fix its broken systems by completely abolishing the Senate.\n\nJohn D.

From too many gifts and too much family time to excessive amounts of food and alcohol, by the time Jan. 1 rolls around, it\u2019s not uncommon to find yourself in a bloated, dazed state, wondering where it all went so horribly wrong.\n\nNow, we\u2019re all about enjoying the holiday season and the treats it has to offer, but particularly in the case of alcohol, overdoing it can be dangerous. Studies show that drinking too much is correlated with everything from depression and anxiety to heart disease and cancer.\n\nHere\u2019s the good news about alcohol and the holiday season: You can drink, you just can\u2019t drink too much. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about exactly how many cocktails and glasses of mulled wine you should be limiting yourself to this month.\n\nHow many drinks are too many?\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing out of the way: Binge drinking is never a good idea. The American Heart Association and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommend no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should drink seven drinks on one night just because you abstained all week.\n\nGut health specialist Vincent Pedre and nutritionist Kelli McGrane strongly recommend sticking to the one-to-two drinks per night rule \u2014 yes, even during the holiday season. But should you overdo it (hey, it happens), Pedre says it\u2019s all about pacing yourself.\n\n\u201cMake sure you eat while you\u2019re drinking to help slow down the absorption of alcohol, and limit yourself to one drink per hour, with no more than four drinks in a night,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cThat said, this advice is general, and if you have a smaller frame, you won\u2019t be able to drink more than two drinks. Know yourself. Listen to your body.\u201d\n\nDitch the sugar where you can.\n\nDuring the holiday season, you\u2019re surrounded by every kind of drink imaginable \u2014 looking at you, eggnog \u2014 but not all alcoholic beverages are created equal. In general, sugary beverages will leave you feeling worse than nonsugary ones and are more likely to lead to weight gain.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get through the holiday season hangover-free and still fitting into your favorite pair of jeans, the most important thing to do is watch your mixers.\n\n\u201cWhile there are limited studies out there promoting health benefits of tequila, red wine and whiskey, the more important factors are what you\u2019re mixing with and which drink can you drink slower and savor for longer,\u201d said McGrane. \u201cTo keep calories in check, avoid drinks with heavy cream, soda and sugary fruit juices. If you don\u2019t like your spirits straight up or on the rocks, you can keep calories lower with many of the classic cocktails: old-fashioned or Manhattan, paloma, mojito, Sazerac, gin and tonic, and martinis.\u201d\n\nPedre, on the other hand, is all about tequila and spritzers. \u201cThe lowest-calorie, lowest-sugar drink you can have is a tequila on the rocks (that is, on ice),\u201d he said. \u201cTequila is low in sugar, easier to metabolize than other alcohols, and a great choice if you are watching your weight. Next up and lighter, a white wine spritzer. It has less alcohol than tequila and the bubbles give it a festive feel.\u201d\n\nHow to cut back on alcohol without sacrificing fun.\n\nIf one or two low-sugar drinks an evening sounds like a snoozefest of a holiday season to you, worry not: There are plenty of ways to cut back on alcohol without sacrificing fun. \u201cKeep things sparkly with kombucha,\u201d McGrane suggested. \u201cSimilar to a wine spritzer, replacing part of your wine or spirit with kombucha will decrease calories and alcohol, while still providing plenty of flavor.\u201d\n\nPedre suggested simply focusing on being present. \u201cFun is all about spontaneity and being in the present moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve used alcohol to loosen up your social awkwardness, get through stressful family obligations or help you have fun in the holidays before, try to focus on engaging conversation instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think we know our family and friends, but get curious \u2014 dig and talk about things you\u2019ve never talked about before,\u201d Pedre added. \u201cDon\u2019t let your preconceptions guide your conversations. Learn something new you never knew about someone.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michelle Obama's Sweet Advice For Meghan Markle Is Simple And Perfect", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-meghan-markle-advice_us_5c054dffe4b0cd916fae6b54", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Michelle Obama has faced her fair share of criticism and praise after many, many years in the public eye.\n\nNaturally, this makes the former first lady the right person to share some sound \u2015 and sweet \u2015 advice for Meghan Markle as the Duchess of Sussex deals with a whole new global level of fame.\n\n\u201cLike me, Meghan probably never dreamt that she\u2019d have a life like this,\u201d Obama said in a new interview for Good Housekeeping\u2019s January issue.\n\n\u201cThe pressure you feel \u2015 from yourself and from others \u2015 can sometimes feel like a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don\u2019t be in a hurry to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work.

Ironically, I wound up suffocating and feeling hungry for air every minute of every day for the next 20 years. Instead of helping, the procedure caused horrific and ever-worsening complications \u2015 a cycle of insidious misery that I feared I would not escape until I drew my last dull, stifling, unsatisfying breath.\n\nImagine finding that an integral part of your nervous system had been hacked away by your trusted doctor without warning, with no pre-surgical notice or discussion of the attendant, potentially life-altering risks. This may seem like the premise of a horror film. But to victims of this tragedy, this enduring, unending terror is real life. And it\u2019s inescapable.\n\nThis is empty nose syndrome, or ENS, though it should be called nasal post-operative suffocation syndrome because that\u2019s what it is: a totally avoidable, physician-induced deformity resulting in an as-of-yet incurable and debilitating condition.\n\nDuring my initial surgery, my turbinates \u2015 what I\u2019ve learned are small but essential organs that sense airflow and signal your brain as to whether you\u2019re breathing \u2015 had been irreversibly damaged. Doctors, including accredited ear, nose and throat surgeons who should have known better but didn\u2019t \u2015 severed vital nerves that were critical to ensuring the proper function of my autonomic nervous system, which governs involuntary functions such as breathing, heartbeat and temperature control. My life, like those of untold numbers of similar victims across the world, would never be the same.\n\nImmediately after my procedure, I experienced a lack of air resistance when breathing and speaking, making these activities that ordinarily came naturally and effortlessly entirely exhausting. I needed to exert great effort simply to project my voice, and for decades I had to catch my breath after speaking just five or six words. I learned how much we take for granted when we\u2019re automatically calibrated to breathe smoothly and fluidly while speaking.\n\nAlthough I was in fact breathing and getting oxygen, my brain was no longer made aware of it, so it communicated to my body that it was suffocating, triggering an unremitting fight/flight response \u2015 a constant state of alert, as if an unseen danger was always imminent.\n\nAlthough I was in fact breathing and getting oxygen, my brain was no longer made aware of it, so it communicated to my body that it was suffocating, triggering an unremitting fight/flight response \u2015 a constant state of alert, as if an unseen danger was always imminent. Living in an unrelenting panic state is highly unnatural. The body is trained to fight or flee quickly, to flush our systems with extra cortisol and adrenaline until we\u2019re safe and our hormonal systems can resume normal balance. But chronic cortisol release is exceedingly damaging to body tissues, and it drastically damaged my nervous system.\n\nAlong with not sensing myself breathing during the day, and my resulting constant state of anxiety, my brain, perceiving suffocation, woke me up every night by generating nightmares when I drifted off. I began experiencing drenching night sweats, forcing me to change my soaking night clothes and bedding two to three times each night. My brain also signaled my stomach to churn, stimulating fierce acid reflux that burned my throat. I began to try to sleep upright in a reclining chair. I was barely 30.\n\nThe suffering didn\u2019t end there: dehydration, dry eyes, ear and facial pain, and the jarring sensation of cold air piercing my lungs whenever I was in an unheated area were miserable, yet mere nuisances compared to the agony of never being allowed to enter into the deeper, restorative levels of sleep \u2015 a torment that\u2019s been used as a torture tactic in war.\n\nStill, there was more: Restlessness and simultaneously feeling exhausted yet wired. Unable to focus or articulate. Not sensing air all day, hyperventilating. The brain shocking the body day and night in a desperate attempt to escape the misperception of suffocation. The continuous coursing of stress hormones catabolizing the body, breaking down precious tissues. Constant, agonizing fear.\n\nSadly, ENS is purely iatrogenic \u2015 caused by medical intervention \u2015 and it\u2019s a dangerous risk to any one of the hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who undergo elective nasal or sinus procedures where turbinate reduction is performed. Turbinates are essential to our well-being, yet many doctors licensed to practice sinus surgery are shockingly ignorant of the role they play and the danger inherent in carving them away.\n\nThe ever-present agony has been described by some victims as 'life worse than death.' Many have said they\u2019d rather have died or become paraplegics than live with ENS.\n\nThe horrific symptoms of ENS can present the moment you wake from surgery or can emerge slowly as nerves die over time, which can take weeks, months or even years. The inevitable unrelenting panic state that is beyond the victim\u2019s conscious control wears on the mind in many ways while it slowly disintegrates the body, as stress hormones \u2015 the death chemicals \u2015 wreak havoc on every organ system.\n\nOnce debilitated by ENS, many have lost their jobs, their homes, their marriages, their families and their independence. For those who develop disabilities, there\u2019s no recourse. Medical science\u2019s unwillingness to recognize ENS as a valid diagnosis makes suing the surgeons largely nonviable, and the typically delayed onset of ENS\u2019s most devastating symptoms places victims\u2019 cases outside of many states\u2019 short one- to two-year statutes of limitations for medical malpractice cases. Tragically, those who end up disabled and unable to work are left with no source of income.\n\nThen there are the suicides. Too many afflicted patients have ended their own lives, having been pushed over the edge not only by the endless suffocation but also by doctors\u2019 ignorance of their condition and dismissal of it as a psychiatric condition as opposed to a legitimate disorder with an identifiable, discrete set of symptoms with little hope of a cure. The ever-present agony has been described by some victims as \u201clife worse than death.\u201d Many have said they\u2019d rather have died or become paraplegics than live with ENS.\n\nThe disheartening truth is that ENTs were being warned of the risk but chose to dismiss the suffering of victims, some even ridiculing their suffocating patients as having \u201cempty head syndrome.\u201d As early as the 1920s, surgeons were imploring others not to remove people\u2019s turbinates because they had observed the devastation some patients suffered following the procedure. In the early 1990s, when the phrase \u201cempty nose syndrome\u201d was coined, a medical scholar once again warned the ENT community about the condition because he had found a high suicide rate among his own patients who had undergone nasal surgery.\n\nIt is time for the medical establishment to reckon with the truth that thousands of people around the world on every inhabited continent who report the same symptoms have one common thread running through the fabric of their medical history: nasal surgery.\n\nOrgans generally are not removed or reduced without full knowledge of the consequences. We know that people can live normally with one kidney or 35 percent of their liver. But no study has even sought to determine how much turbinate tissue can be removed safely while enabling the patient to maintain proper respiratory function.\n\nSurely, if death were an associated risk of turbinate reduction it would be disclosed. Yet no requirement compels ENTs to disclose the risk of living a \u201clife worse than death,\u201d or to obtain informed patient consent acknowledging the risk of ENS when undergoing nasal surgery, leaving patients unaware that they\u2019re entering a lottery they don\u2019t want to win.\n\nI took for granted that my body had been designed to operate on automatic until I was forced into manual operation.\n\nFor me, receiving a proper diagnosis was an uphill battle that spanned more than 15 years. Because the medical community offered no solutions, I turned to ancient Eastern thought systems to learn how to influence my central nervous system and endocrine system. I discovered ayurveda and followed the principles set forth by the sages. I learned how to eat, what to eat and when to eat to keep cortisol levels low. I embraced yoga and meditation with consciously controlled breathing during my waking hours. But still, I could not influence my breath once asleep. I learned to sleep in segments. I needed to monitor my internal environment and modulate my external environment for things like temperature and humidity. Above all, I had to mitigate stress.\n\nThrough the years and with these practices, I managed to improve significantly and I reclaimed much of what I had lost in my life. None of this was a cure, of course, but without conscious management of my body, I would not have survived. I took for granted that my body had been designed to operate on automatic until I was forced into manual operation.\n\nToday, more than 20 years and thousands of harmful surgeries too late \u2015 mine included \u2015 there are finally four pioneering North American doctors treating this disorder: Dr. Subinoy Das at the U.S. Institute for Advanced Sinus Care and Research in Ohio, Dr. Steven Houser at MetroHealth in Ohio, Dr. Jayakar Nayak at Stanford Health Care in California, and Dr. Andrew Thamboo at St. Paul\u2019s Sinus Centre in Canada.\n\nWhile some patients experience improvement from these often painful and expensive procedures, nothing yet cures ENS or fully restores sufferers to their previous levels of health. For some, their suffocation remains unrelenting. And because a diagnosis code for ENS does not yet exist, insurance companies will not cover these new treatment options, making them inaccessible for most ENS sufferers. A diagnostic code, and more research funding, are desperately needed to help not only existing sufferers but the new victims being afflicted every day all around the globe.\n\nIn April of this year, I sought treatment with Das. He used a cutting-edge tissue regenerative therapy and I have had good results; an increase in volume and air resistance and my facial nerve pain has resolved. While I still suffer from intermittent suffocation, my overall functioning has improved, and I am able finally to sleep more deeply most nights.\n\nToday I\u2019m taking life one breath at a time.\n\nBarbara Schmidt is a New Jersey-based writer, practitioner of holistic medicine and an advocate for health care justice and reform.

One enables the device to detect tiny blood vessels; another, called elastography, was developed to examine the liver, and can help measure the density of placental tissue.\n\nDr. Abuhamad\u2019s team is using these advances in ultrasound to chart placental health in about 500 pregnant women, including 300 at high risk of complications. They are collecting ultrasound data and blood samples from the women at eight time points during pregnancy to see which early features track with problems later on.\n\nOther teams are trying to identify particles the placenta may release into the bloodstream because that could lead to a simple blood test for diagnosing problems.

From the start, hospital officials told him to set aside $30,000 in a separate bank account to cover the costs.\n\nMr. Mannion, 59, who received his new lungs in May 2017, reflected: \u201cHere you are, you need a heart \u2014 that\u2019s a tough road for any person,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then for that person to have to be a fund-raiser?\u201d"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Well : Even a Little Weight Training May Cut the Risk of Heart Attack and Stroke", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/move/even-a-little-weight-training-may-cut-the-risk-of-heart-attack-and-stroke.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-04 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Despite the muscle-building, flab-trimming and, according to recent research, mood-boosting benefits of lifting weights, such resistance exercise has generally been thought not to contribute much to heart health, as endurance workouts like jogging and cycling do. But a study published in October in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise provides evidence for the first time that even a little weight training might reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. People appear to gain this benefit whether or not they also engage in frequent aerobic exercise.\n\nThe study drew from an invaluable cache of health data gathered at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, where thousands of men and women have been undergoing annual checkups, which include filling out detailed questionnaires about their exercise habits and medical history. More than 12,500 records were anonymized for men and women, most of them middle-aged, who had visited the clinic at least twice between 1987 and 2006. The subjects were categorized according to their reported resistance exercise routines, ranging from those who never lifted to those who completed one, two, three or more weekly sessions (or whether they lifted for more or less than an hour each week). Another category was aerobic exercise and whether subjects met the standard recommendation of 150 minutes per week of brisk workouts. This exercise data was then crosschecked against heart attacks, strokes and deaths during the 11 years or so after each participant\u2019s last clinic visit.\n\nThe findings were dramatic: The risk of experiencing these events was roughly 50 percent lower for those who lifted weights occasionally, compared with those who never did \u2014 even when they were not doing the recommended endurance exercise. People who lifted twice a week, for about an hour or so in total, had the greatest declines in risk. (Interestingly, the subjects who reported weight training four or more times per week did not show any significant health benefits compared with those who never lifted, although the researchers believe this finding is probably a statistical anomaly.)\n\n\u201cThe good news,\u201d says Duck-chul Lee, an associate professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and co-author of the study, \u201cis that we found substantial heart benefits associated with a very small amount of resistance exercise.\u201d As an associational study, the results show only that people who occasionally lift weights happen to have healthier hearts \u2014 not that resistance training directly reduces heart-related health risks. The data, though, does reveal associations between weight lifting and a lower body mass index, Lee says, which might be connected to fewer heart problems. He and his colleagues do not know the specifics of what exercises people were doing \u2014 lat pull-downs? dead lifts? squats? \u2014 or how many repetitions they did or at what level of resistance. Lee says he is in the early stages of a major study to examine some of those factors. But he doesn\u2019t suggest waiting for those results."}]
