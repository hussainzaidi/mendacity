Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,\" Trump tweeted minutes after landing in France. He is set to spend the weekend in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I.\n\nTuesday on Europe 1 radio, Macron called for a \"real European army\" within the European Union, according to AFP\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron also suggested that since the start of Trump's presidency, the US has been seen as a less reliable ally.\n\n\"When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim? Europe and its security,\" he said.\n\nMacron has been advocating a similar position for months.\n\nA senior French official said Friday night that Trump took Macron's words out \"out of context.\"\n\nAccording to the official, Macron will likely want to respond to Trump's tweet directly himself, and likely Saturday.\n\nThe official, though, clarified the language Macron used, saying that the French leader did not mean he wanted a European army but better coordination and funding of Europe's already-existing resources.\n\nThe official said that Macron was conveying that Europe should organize better to protect itself. There is already a European defense project, and Macron would like to see more capability, the official said.\n\n\"Not a European army. He did not mean Europe should form an army,\" the official said. \"And this is all complementary to NATO, not separate from it.\"\n\nFurther strain in Trump-Macron relationship\n\nTrump's tweet on Friday could preview another high-level international meeting in which the US President distances himself from traditional American allies. Unlike the tense G7 summit in June, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be present at this weekend's commemoration.\n\nWhile both Trump and Macron appeared to be off to a warm start following Trump's inauguration, their relationship appears to have soured.\n\nDuring a call about trade and migration in June, sources familiar with the call told CNN that it didn't end well.\n\n\"Just bad. It was terrible,\" a source told CNN . \"Macron thought he would be able to speak his mind, based on the relationship. But Trump can't handle being criticized like that.\"\n\nAnd more recently, a senior diplomatic source told CNN that Trump was \"ranting and venting on trade\" with Macron during their bilateral meeting in September.\n\nThere was \"some rapport\" between the two, \"but it's not what it (once) was,\" the source said.\n\nMacron isn't the only European leader to raise the prospect of Europe doing more for its own defense.\n\nEU President Donald Tusk made a similar suggestion in May after Trump had pulled out of the Iran deal and the Paris climate agreement, threatened a series of trade disputes with Europe and constantly criticized NATO.\n\n\"Europe must do everything in its power to protect, in spite of today's mood, the transatlantic bond. But at the same time we must be prepared for those scenarios, where we will have to act on our own,\" Tusk said.\n\nTusk also said that the EU \"should be grateful\" to Trump \"because, thanks to him, we have got rid of all illusions.\"\n\n\"Looking at the latest decisions of President Trump, someone could even think: With friends like that, who needs enemies?\" Tusk said, later adding, \"He has made us realize that if you need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of your arm.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Trump jets to Paris, leaving political tumult behind", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/tsAP7WLd1HM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) Sullen and combative after an electoral humbling, President Donald Trump landed Friday in Paris, hoping to use the global stage to restore some standing as he faces a tumultuous political future at home .\n\nThe President and first lady are visiting the French capital for a ceremony commemorating 100 years since the end of World War I, a weighty moment for the world to remember the conflict that did not wind up ending all wars.\n\nOfficials say the President will use the moment to underscore the essential role the United States played in restoring European peace and security -- and continues to play now, despite Trump's complaints that it costs too much.

Roots of trees and arms of ivy grapple with the legacy of four years of war, fighting to reclaim the landscape from the scars of a past conflict.\n\nWWI left behind a broken landscape: shell holes, trenches and soil sown with years of unexploded bombs. Today a forest blankets the battlefields. But it cloaks perhaps millions of dud shells, tens of thousands of bodies and one of the most toxic sites in France.\n\nNo-go 'zone rouge'\n\nThe front lines crisscrossed the fields of Verdun for almost the duration of WWI. Some 60 million shells were fired during the 10-month battle here from February to December 1916.\n\n\"The optimistic rate is that one in eight did not explode. That means that we probably have between seven and eight million shells that did not explode on the battlefield of Verdun,\" said Guillaume Moizan, 34, a local historian and guide. \"The pessimistic way would be to say one in four did not explode.\"\n\nThe destruction was total. A postwar report on these battlefields described the land as: \"Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.\"\n\nThe French government's response was to declare vast tracts of northern France off limits, creating a \"zone rouge\" or red zone.\n\n\"All the battlefield sites where the French government thought it would be too expensive to clean the soil to have it restored back to farming land were declared zone rouge,\" said Guillaume Rouard, a ranger with France's National Forests Office (ONF).\n\n\"From the North Sea to the Franche-Comt\u00e9 (Swiss border) we estimate that there were 150,000 hectares that were declared red zone and a large part was given back to agriculture,\" he added.\n\nMuch of the rest was eventually forested. Planted with German pine from the Black Forest as part of war reparations, the forest of Verdun was, from its inception, a symbol of healing and commemoration.\n\n\"It's allowed us to conserve all that's around you, the holes, the trenches -- we're in one of the rare zones in France where you can walk like it was in 1918,\" Rouard said. \"That wasn't really the objective right after the war. The objective was more to give a sense of production to this landscape destroyed by war.\"\n\nToday it holds a different role. Bunkers and trenches hide among the trees, jutting out of the undergrowth, paying silent witness to the 300,000 French and German men who died here. The stony ruins of the area's nine villages, devastated during the war, lie dotted around the forest. One of them, Fleury, changed hands 16 times during the battle. Officially, they have \"died for France.\"\n\nSo savage was the fighting that no one knows for sure how many soldiers were laid to rest in the imposing white ossuary at Douaumont. The bodies of between 80,000 and 100,000 men remain lost in the forest.\n\nScars of conflicts past\n\nWith an autumn carpet of leaves on the ground, the crooked spine of French trenches in Saint-Mihiel wood, south of Verdun, is easy to miss. Softly shallowed out by a century of rain, these French lines are distinguished from the undergrowth only by their unbroken path between the trees.\n\nJust a stone's throw away, almost touching, the concrete-walled German lines are a stark contrast. Bar the ivy that coats their walls, they seem untouched since the war. Shelves stand ready for weapons, firing slits sit open toward the enemy's guns and stony steps descend into subterranean dugouts.\n\nBut a century on, the ghosts of the Great War are still felt.\n\nOn the forest's edge beside the river Meuse, Guy Momper, 58, chief of the Metz demining team, rattles off his team's latest haul matter-of-factly. In one October week they have pulled six tons of German artillery shells from the riverbed.\n\n\"In a good year we collect 50 tons from 1,000 callouts,\" Momper said.\n\nThe regional demining service deploys a team every day to make safe legacy munitions that locals find. Most are from WWI.\n\n\"Those people, they have 'shell culture,'\" said the demining chief. \"The old have seen so many, they moved many from their fields and so on, it doesn't move them any longer.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment echoed by those who live alongside these dangers.\n\n\"We have lots of students who dig around all the time to find old shells and grenades,\" said Fanny Burillon, 41, a history teacher from the Somme region -- another WWI battlefield -- visiting Verdun with her family. \"We try to explain to them that it's forbidden,\" she added. \"For us it's part of life. It's not something really shocking for us.\"\n\nLa place a gaz\n\nAlthough bombs may no longer hold great risk to life, ironically probably the most dangerous legacy of WWI comes from events that followed the war. In the outer reaches of Verdun's forests where the trees begin to mingle with open fields lies La place a Gaz.\n\nThat's what locals call this site -- a hunter's shack in a forest clearing, nondescript but for the surrounding rings of razor wire -- which has a toxic legacy. Companies contracted by the French authorities burned unused poison gas shells here after the war.\n\n\"They burned it for years, basically for the entire 1920s and we never thought about the consequences,\" said historian Moizan.\n\nThe results are obvious nearly a century later. A 2007 environmental study of the site showed the soil holds levels of arsenic up to 35,000 times higher than typical soil levels. In some areas this lethal compound makes up 17.5% of the soil. But for small shrubs, little grows on this patch of polluted earth.\n\nWhile La place a Gaz isn't representative of the battlefields as a whole, it provides powerful testimony to war's persistent fallout.\n\nA verdant memory\n\nThese environmental stains of WWI may serve a higher purpose.\n\nA century on and we can no longer rely on the generation who fought in the Great War for living testimony. The forests of Verdun, which exist only because of the zone rouge, are an important vehicle for keeping alive the memory of the conflict.\n\nSchoolteacher Burillon said the forest is \"at the same time living and frozen in time. It's very poetic.\"\n\nThe trees of Verdun may still be locked in battle with the ghosts of World War I but the physical remains of this enduring conflict serve one higher purpose: that we might never forget.\n\n\"We're a bit blas\u00e9,\" Burillon said. \"I was reflecting that we don't pay much attention to the military cemeteries, we have them every 200 meters.\n\n\"Coming here it's like we had never appreciated what the war was. It makes you think.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "In photos: World War I, then and now", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/XiLtQzpXgJ0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It was meant to be \"the war to end all wars.\"\n\nBut, of course, we now know that it was just the first World War -- and a preview of more conflict to come.\n\nMore than 8.5 million troops perished in World War I, which ended 100 years ago this week.

Never able to recover from her unpopular decision to allow entry to millions of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East, Merkel announced recently that she would not seek another term in office.\n\nAnd British Prime Minister Theresa May is still struggling to complete her country's exit from the European Union, a thankless task that has earned her both ridicule and rivals from her own party. Many observers don't give her long in office when, and if, the Brexit plan is complete.\n\nTrump and Putin\n\nJUST WATCHED New arms race brewing between US and Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New arms race brewing between US and Russia 02:36\n\nOne leader in attendance not facing immediate political trouble: Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the President is likely to encounter during Sunday's centenary ceremonies.\n\nTrump and Putin had engaged in on-again, off-again plans for a more formal meeting in Paris, but French officials intervened, telling the US and Russia that talks between the two leaders would overshadow the solemn commemoration of the end of the war. Trump announced on Wednesday that there was simply no time to meet with Putin in France.\n\n\"I'm coming back very quickly,\" the President said. \"I don't think we have time set aside for that meeting.\"\n\nInstead, he said a meeting with Putin -- which will act as a follow-up to a maligned summit to two men held in Helsinki, Finland, over the summer -- would occur on the sidelines of the G20 summit at the end of the month in Buenos Aires (Trump will also use those talks for a dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping).\n\nWhichever the venue, Trump will face close scrutiny after his last summit with Putin ended with him essentially accepting Putin's denial that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. With Democrats soon in control of the House, investigations into the Russia matter are all but guaranteed not to subside. And special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference is poised to scale up its public activity now that the midterm elections have concluded.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said she hoped America's \"Russophobic fervor\" would end soon, but she speculated the new political climate would only escalate tensions between Washington and Moscow.\n\n\"There is unfortunately a sense that a new round of these allegations will start, but it seems to me Americans should begin to understand the absurdity of this,\" she said. \"Many already do. I mean American politicians.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Hong Kong denies entry to UK journalist", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/T5lHBgcioqU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Hong Kong (CNN) A senior British journalist denied a work visa by the Hong Kong authorities was barred from entering the city as a tourist Thursday, in the same week a talk by exiled Chinese dissident writer Ma Jian was canceled, raising new fears over press freedoms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nFinancial Times Asia editor Victor Mallet was turned away at the border after several hours of questioning by immigration officers, the newspaper said, weeks after his working visa renewal was controversially refused\n\nUnder current immigration rules, British nationals are typically allowed into Hong Kong without a visa, after which they are permitted to stay for 180 days.\n\nHong Kong's refusal to grant Mallet entry as a tourist effectively places him on a blacklist.\n\nThe Financial Times is currently appealing the earlier decision, which was widely seen as a response to Mallet hosting a talk by a pro-Hong Kong independence activist in his role as acting President of the Foreign Correspondent's Club.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said it was \"pure speculation\" to connect Mallet's expulsion with the August talk by Hong Kong National Party (HKNP) founder Andy Chan, whose organization was later banned.\n\n\"As a rule, not only locally, but internationally, we will never disclose, the Immigration Department will not disclose the individual circumstances of the case or the considerations of his decision,\" she added.\n\nVictor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist, speaks at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) in Hong Kong, August 14, 2018.\n\nWhen asked whether media organizations could face repercussions if they interviewed pro-independence figures in the future, Lam responded by referring to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's de facto constitution.\n\n\"Freedom of expression, freedom of reporting are core values in Hong Kong, and as the Chief Executive, I ... will safeguard all these rights as enshrined in the Basic Law,\" Lam said. \"Every act, every case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, the policy and the circumstances, including the facts of the case.\"\n\nFreedom of expression has been looking increasingly shaky in recent weeks, however. On Wednesday, Chinese dissident writer Ma Jian, who is based in London, said that an event he was due to speak at in the city had been canceled by the venue.\n\nMa was scheduled to host two talks Saturday at Tai Kwun, an art space which has received government funding, as part of the events of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Part of the talk was to focus on his new book, \"China Dream.\"\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Ma tweeted: \"Just been told that my two events at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival this week can no longer be held at Tai Kwun, where all the other events are taking place. An alternative venue will have to be found. No reason has been given to me yet.\"\n\nJust been told that my two events at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival this week can no longer be held at Tai Kwun, where all the other events are taking place.

I'm a novelist, not an activist, and am attending the Festival to discuss my new novel, China Dream. My 'politics' are simple: I believe in free thought and free speech. Without them, life has no meaning. \u2014 \u9a6c\u5efa Ma Jian (@majian53) November 8, 2018\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Director of Tai Kwun Timothy Calnin said organizers \"do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\"\n\n\"The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,\" said Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, a pro-free speech organization.\n\n\"It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity,\" added Ng.\n\nA second replacement venue which had stepped in to host the event has also pulled out, according to Hong Kong Free Press. There's no mention of the venue on the Hong Kong Literary Festival web page promoting the Ma Jian talk.\n\nIt is unclear whether Ma will be allowed entry in the city. Writing on Twitter Thursday, Ma said that he remained \"determined to go\" to the city despite concerns that he would be turned away by immigration officials on arrival. \"It is precisely at times such as this when free speech is under threat that writers have a duty to speak out,\" he added.\n\nLast week, another Chinese dissident decided against traveling to Hong Kong amid heightened safety fears.\n\nArtist Badiucao had been due to present a new work at an event that was itself later canceled , following alleged threats made to the organizers.\n\nPosters of Chinese President Xi Jinping by dissident artist Badiucao.\n\n\"We are sorry to announce that the exhibition 'Gongle,' by Chinese artist Badiucao, has been canceled,\" the Hong Kong Free Press, a local publication which was co-sponsoring the event, said in a statement.\n\n\"The decision follows threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist. Whilst the organizers value freedom of expression, the safety of our partners remains a major concern.\"\n\nHong Kong police said that anyone with safety concerns should contact them, but would not comment on the individual case. Representatives of the Chinese government in Hong Kong also did not comment.\n\nTaken together, Mallet, Ma and Badiucao's experiences have raised severe concerns about Hong Kong's ongoing commitment to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, both of which are enshrined in its de facto constitution but heavily limited in mainland China.\n\n\"To deny Mallet his work after hosting Andy Chan from the HKNP at the FCC and expelling him from Hong Kong was ridiculous enough, and a grave infringement of press freedom in itself,\" democracy activist Joshua Wong said Friday.\n\n\"Banning him from the city altogether, even as a tourist, is nothing less than an authoritarian attempt to censor all opposing voices. This development is extremely worrying, especially for journalists sent to this city to report on Hong Kong and Chinese political situations. I hope that the international community can now see the severity of the situation of freedom in Hong Kong, and try to protect the rights of their own citizens here,\" added Wong."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Deadly wildfire destroys Paradise, California", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/2k3QuBdW3VQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the wildfire raged nearby, Whitney Vaughan and her husband had just enough time to grab a laundry basket of dirty clothes and some pictures before fleeing their home in Paradise, California.\n\nVaughan could hear screams and explosions nearby Thursday as she and her husband got in their car and drove away.

Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.\n\nThe Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock.\n\n\"There's really not much left.

It has also created new controversies, with legal experts debating about the legality of the appointment and news stories featuring his past criticisms of Mueller and defense of Trump.\n\nThe transformation of Sessions from influential early backer of Trump's improbable presidential campaign to frequent target of the President's scorn is a study in the fickleness of political alliances in Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorney general received the call everyone in Washington knew was coming some day soon.\n\nJohn Kelly, the White House chief of staff, asked Sessions to submit his resignation, according to multiple sources briefed on the call. Sessions agreed to comply, but he wanted a few more days before the resignation would become effective. Kelly said he'd consult the President.\n\nSoon, the sources say, top Justice officials convened on the 5th floor suite of offices for the attorney general. Eventually, there were two huddles in separate offices. Among those in Sessions' office was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, his deputy Ed O'Callaghan, Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nA few yards away, Whitaker strategized with other aides, including Gary Barnett, now his chief of staff.\n\nThe rival huddles, which haven't been previously reported, laid bare a break in the relationship between Sessions and Whitaker that had emerged in recent weeks, after it became clear that Whitaker played a behind-the-scenes role in an aborted effort to oust Rosenstein.\n\nA source close to Sessions says that the former attorney general realized that Whitaker was \"self-dealing\" after reports surfaced in September that Whitaker had spoken with Kelly and had discussed plans to become the No. 2 at the Justice Department if Rosenstein was forced to resign.\n\nIn recent months, with his relationship with the President at a new low, Sessions skipped several so-called principals meetings that he was slated to attend as a key member of the Cabinet. A source close to Sessions says that neither the attorney general nor Trump thought it was a good idea for Sessions to be at the White House, so he sent surrogates. Whitaker was one of them.\n\nBut Sessions did not realize Whitaker was having conversations with the White House about his future until the news broke in late September about Rosenstein.\n\nOn Wednesday as aides began drafting Sessions' resignation letter, the distrust for Whitaker burst into the open.\n\nThe fact that Whitaker would become acting attorney general, passing over Rosenstein suddenly raised concerns about the impact on the most high-profile investigation in the Justice Department, the Russia probe led by Mueller. The Mueller probe has been at the center of Trump's ire directed at Sessions and the Justice Department. Whitaker has made comments criticizing Mueller's investigation and Rosenstein's oversight of it, and has questioned the allegations of Russian interference.\n\nRosenstein and O'Callaghan, the highest-ranked officials handling day-to-day oversight of Mueller's investigation, urged Sessions to delay the effective date of his resignation.\n\nSoon, Whitaker strode into Sessions' office and asked to speak one-on-one to the attorney general; the others left the two men alone. It was a brief conversation. Shortly after, Sessions told his huddle that his resignation would be effective that day.\n\nO'Callaghan had tried to appeal to Sessions, noting that he hadn't heard back about whether the President would allow a delay. At least one Justice official in the room mentioned that there would be legal questions about whether Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general is constitutional. Someone also reminded Sessions that the last time Whitaker played a role in a purported resignation -- a few weeks earlier in September, with Rosenstein -- the plan collapsed.\n\nSessions never heard in person from the President -- the man who gained television fame for his catch-phrase \"You're fired\" doesn't actually like such confrontation and prefers to have others do the firing, people close to the President say. Kelly called Sessions a second time to tell him the President had rejected his request for a delay.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nJUST WATCHED Despite denial, Trump said last month he knows Whitaker Replay More Videos ...

Sessions interviewed him and the two grew to have a good working relationship. Sessions liked him, but even if he didn't, the plan was already hatched for him to take the role, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nLeonard Leo, the influential executive vice president of the Federalist Society, recommended to then-White House counsel Don McGahn that Whitaker would make a good chief of staff for Sessions.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo said Friday.\n\n\"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department,\" he added. \"Whitaker was a very good former US attorney and is a very good manager. He's a no-nonsense, get-it-done kind of guy.\"\n\nWhitaker, a 49-year-old former U.S. attorney from Iowa and former CNN contributor, is a gregarious imposing presence that fits his former life as college football tight end. His Twitter feed, which he made private in recent days, shows a picture of him weightlifting, a passion he complains he doesn't get as much time to enjoy these days.\n\nOn Thursday, his first full day as acting attorney general, and with criticism of his appointment beginning to swirl, he tried to exude a calm demeanor. He convened a late afternoon meeting with senior department officials. He kept remarks brief, saying he was proud to lead them, that they've been doing good work and to keep doing what they're doing. Another call, also brief, with US attorneys around the country followed.\n\nOn Friday, he sent his first department-wide message, thanking Sessions for his service and extolling the work of colleagues around the country. \"As we move forward, I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nSessions' last day\n\nThe ignominious end to Sessions' tenure is a far cry from the early days of the 2016 campaign, when he became an eager surrogate. Sessions' hardline views on immigration became suffused in the rhetoric that Trump adopted.\n\nSessions was the first US senator to endorse Trump at a time when establishment Republicans were still staying away, and he left his safe Alabama Senate seat to take the attorney general job.\n\nSeveral members of his staff also joined the President's team, helping to craft some of the harsh immigration policies that Sessions often preached from Capitol Hill and which have become a cornerstone of stump speeches that Trump regularly uses to excite his political base.\n\nBut months into the job, Trump had soured on Sessions for the sin of recusing himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible connections to the Trump campaign.\n\nMore recently, Sessions appeared at peace with the prospect of being ousted from office. He made a series of valedictory visits with law enforcement around the country, seeking to underline what he believes will be his legacy of strong support for law enforcement and efforts to reduce crime.\n\nSessions spent Election Day on Tuesday surrounded by what he loves: cops and sweets.\n\nHe visited the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where officials warmly greeted him and provided a briefing on their latest capabilities.\n\nOver a plate of Milano cookies, he was an engaged questioner asking a scientist about DNA identification and how it has affected guilty pleas in court.\n\nLater, when he arrived in the cafeteria for lunch, a room full of FBI personnel and local police officers training in the National Academy rose to their feet as he entered the room. He went around from table to table, shaking hands, posing for pictures -- soaking up the moment and capping it off with vanilla ice cream with sprinkles.\n\nRoughly 24 hours later, he was out of a job."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump spars with Macron as Air Force One lands in France", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/dBw7zE5xDCs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:14", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump picked a fight with French President Emmanuel Macron over European defense just as Air Force One landed in France on Friday.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia.

But I didn't know Matt Whitaker. He worked for Attorney General Sessions.\"\n\nThe President's comments are at odds with the relationship Trump has forged with Whitaker in recent months, even as his opinion of Sessions continued to sour. Whitaker has been at the White House dozens of times, including in meetings with Trump, and the two have spoken by phone on several occasions, including on the day that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was expected to be fired.\n\nAnd in an October 11 interview on Fox News, Trump made clear he did, in fact, know Whitaker well.\n\n\"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker,\" he said.\n\nWhitaker was not hired as Sessions' chief of staff by virtue of any pre-existing relationship with Sessions, but instead because White House officials believed Whitaker's loyalties would lie at the White House and not with the beleaguered attorney general, sources said.\n\nAnd over the last year, Whitaker has told friends about his growing relationship with Trump. The President knew that he had played football and the tall, brawny former US attorney fit the image Trump liked, according to people familiar with their conversations, far more than the diminutive Sessions, whom Trump mocked.\n\n\"He looks like the kind of guy who sits at the head of a table,\" a source familiar with the matter said of Whitaker.\n\nQuestions arise\n\nEven as he claimed on Friday not to know Whitaker, it was clear Trump maintained an affinity for him, praising his qualifications for the job as he insisted Whitaker was being unfairly maligned.\n\nSome legal scholars -- including George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Other critics have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein because the move puts Whitaker in charge of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which Whitaker had been publicly critical of.\n\nTrump insisted Friday that he had not spoken with Whitaker about the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it. I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President's move to distance himself from Whitaker is a familiar refrain Trump has used when associates of his have become embroiled in controversy.\n\nWhen federal prosecutors targeted his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen, Trump insisted Cohen handled only a \"tiny, tiny fraction\" of his legal work. Before that, he claimed that his indicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort worked for him for \"a very short period of time.\" And shortly before ousting his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, who also helmed his campaign, Trump maintained Bannon \"came on very late.\"\n\nStill, the President praised Whitaker as \"very highly thought of\" and said that Whitaker is only taking heat because \"anybody that works for me, they do a number on him.\"\n\n\"Matt Whitaker is a very smart man, he is a very respected man in the law enforcement community, top of the line,\" Trump said. \"He's acting, I think he'll do a very good job and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nIn an email to Department of Justice staff on Friday, Whitaker vowed to lead \"a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\"\n\nSense of concern\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker linked to defunct 'scam' company Replay More Videos ...

Several senior officials said they were surprised by the criticism and believe it could potentially jeopardize his chances to remain in the post if it continues to dominate headlines.\n\nIt was not widely known among the staff that he had commented repeatedly on the special counsel's investigation in interviews and on television -- an irony given that Whitaker's TV appearances helped him land his job at the Justice Department and people close to Trump encouraged Whitaker to keep up his TV appearances to draw Trump's attention.\n\nWhitaker was tapped by the White House to serve as Sessions' chief of staff in September 2017, with sources describing then-White House counsel Don McGahn as the person behind the hiring.\n\nMcGahn was drawn to Whitaker because he had a stalwart reputation in right-wing legal circles and because the White House wanted someone who was competent, could mind Sessions and could \"keep things on the rails\" at the Justice Department.\n\nLeonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, said he recommended Whitaker for that post.\n\n\"I recommended him and was very supportive of him for chief of staff for very specific reasons,\" Leo told CNN. \"Jeff Sessions needed a reliable conservative, a strong manager, and someone who had credibility who had previously served the department.

Kelly would often call Whitaker to convey when Trump was unhappy with something at the Justice Department or with Sessions in particular, and another source said Kelly and Whitaker were \"cut from the same cloth.\"\n\nWhitaker also worked to forge a relationship with the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner during trips to the White House, understanding they were key to moving up in Trump's eyes.\n\nGeorge Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who is a Sessions ally and familiar with his senior staff, described Whitaker as a \"good lawyer\" with \"good political skills and instincts\" and said he had grown close to the White House.\n\nTerwilliger said Whitaker's position had put him in contact with the White House \"where he's held in pretty high regard.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Whitaker said he supports state's rights to nullify federal law", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/1hlRU7Dke68/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:17", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Matthew Whitaker, the new acting attorney general, has said that states have the right to nullify federal law, but that they need the political courage to do so.\n\nWhitaker, whom President Donald Trump announced as acting attorney general on Wednesday after he fired Jeff Sessions, made the comments during a failed 2014 run for the Republican Senate nomination in Iowa.\n\n\"As a principle, it has been turned down by the courts and our federal government has not recognized it,\" Whitaker said while taking questions during a September 2013 campaign speech . \"Now we need to remember that the states set up the federal government and not vice versa.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors share gun stories, demand action after NRA tells them to 'stay in their lane'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DpMBghpNdxY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:20", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

The medical association has long maintained that firearm-related deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis.\n\nThe recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety.\n\nThe argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic , known as SAFE, are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement \"evidence-based policy\" on guns.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments.\n\n\"The so-called 'uproar' on twitter or what could [be] characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet. It's clear form the comments that they didn't read the article,\" Jennifer Baker wrote in an email. \"It's just another example of gun control advocates with the help of the mainstream media blaming law abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of deranged people and exploiting tragedy to push a gun control agenda that would not prevent these crimes. The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent [last night's] tragedy.\"\n\nBaker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided.\n\nIf medical organizations \"would like to concentrate on a public health crisis,\" she wrote, \"they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly 50,000 suicides per year, the medical community's complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over 42,000 lives per year or the 250,000 deaths due to medical errors.\"\n\nFew NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors, nurses and others.\n\nBut some stepped onto the field, like @wickedgrin1, who said, \"This is a crime issue, not a public health issue.

It's a higher rate for the 50 largest metropolitan areas combined, with 4.9 people per 100,000 killed by a gun. This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this? When there are so many deaths, we need to invest in this issue now,\" Hargarten said. \"Look what we did with HIV and AIDS when it was breaking out in the '80s and '90s. The federal government addressed it, and the complexity and the political issues, and it helped groups most at risk, by investing our resources appropriately, and it made a huge difference in that disease process. It's imperative that we do that for guns.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Trump administration weakens Obamacare birth control coverage mandate", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/clAlWW-oCtQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:21", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Trump administration issued two final rules on Wednesday providing employers more flexibility with exemptions to deny women insurance coverage for birth control.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employer-provided health insurance plans are required to cover birth control as a preventive service.\n\nNow, the US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a final rule providing exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate to entities that object to such coverage based on religious beliefs.

It based that percentage on the 165 million women in America, many of whom are not in their childbearing years.\n\nThe agency calculated that, at most, 120,000 women would be affected: mainly those who work at the roughly 200 entities that have been involved in 50 or so lawsuits over birth control coverage.\n\nPolicy experts, however, argued that this could open the door to hundreds of employers dropping coverage.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor instance, there are hundreds of Catholic hospitals, nursing homes and nonprofits that may want to stop providing contraceptives, said Tim Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nExperts pointed out last year that many women use birth control for more than pregnancy prevention, including treatment of hormonal imbalances and endometriosis.\n\n\"There is no way to know how many women will be affected,\" said Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy research and communications."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "California wildfires: Malibu homes burn as death toll climbs to nine", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46161280", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:22", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The Woolsey Fire raced west into coastal communities, including Malibu\n\nA raging wildfire in southern California has swept into the beach resort of Malibu - home to many Hollywood stars - leaving buildings burning and sending residents fleeing.\n\nFurther north, another huge wildfire destroyed the town of Paradise, leaving nine people dead and 35 missing.\n\nIn all, three major fires are burning across the state.\n\nAmong the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities say the Camp Fire in the north and the Woolsey Fire and Hill Fire in the south are being fanned by strong winds.\n\nMore than 250,000 people have been evacuated across the areas.\n\n\"The magnitude of the destruction of the fire is unbelievable and heartbreaking,\" said Mark Ghilarducci, of the California governor's office.\n\nWhere is the Woolsey Fire?\n\nThe blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles.

including non plug-in varieties - showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range.\n\n\"There are some examples where employees aren't even charging these vehicles up,\" said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy's managing director.\n\n\"The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel.\n\nThis practice, he added, was \"ridiculous\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK government subsidised plug in hybrids for seven years\n\nThe British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which represents many fleets, said higher taxes on diesel cars incentivised companies to buy plug-ins, even if they had no intention of using their electric capability.\n\n\"We unfortunately have got a situation where a poorly designed tax regime is driving some poor behaviours,\" said Toby Poston, \u200bthe BVRLA's communications director.\n\n\"We have got some situations where company drivers are choosing the vehicle based on their tax liability, rather than having the right vehicle for the right job.\"\n\nSome companies, he explained, were buying PHEVs - which are best suited to local trips - for employees who did a lot of motorway driving.\n\nWhen presented with The Miles Consultancy's findings, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government believed plug-in hybrids \"bring significant environmental benefits\", but would \"now focus its support on zero emission models like pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars\".\n\nPlug-in hybrid vehicles continue to receive some government support, through lower car tax rates, grants for charging infrastructure and, in some local authorities, free parking."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "Video of 'pushy' dad helping son save goal goes viral", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46155437", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The video has been seen by millions of people\n\nWhen Phil Hatfield was watching his six-year-old son play football, he could not resist giving him a \"helping\" hand.\n\nLittle did he know the moment would be seen by more than 18 million people.\n\nThe video of the children's game in Bow Street, near Aberystwyth, shows under-8s goalkeeper Osian saving a shot -

including non plug-in varieties - showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range.\n\n\"There are some examples where employees aren't even charging these vehicles up,\" said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy's managing director.\n\n\"The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel.\n\nThis practice, he added, was \"ridiculous\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK government subsidised plug in hybrids for seven years\n\nThe British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which represents many fleets, said higher taxes on diesel cars incentivised companies to buy plug-ins, even if they had no intention of using their electric capability.\n\n\"We unfortunately have got a situation where a poorly designed tax regime is driving some poor behaviours,\" said Toby Poston, \u200bthe BVRLA's communications director.\n\n\"We have got some situations where company drivers are choosing the vehicle based on their tax liability, rather than having the right vehicle for the right job.\"\n\nSome companies, he explained, were buying PHEVs - which are best suited to local trips - for employees who did a lot of motorway driving.\n\nWhen presented with The Miles Consultancy's findings, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government believed plug-in hybrids \"bring significant environmental benefits\", but would \"now focus its support on zero emission models like pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars\".\n\nPlug-in hybrid vehicles continue to receive some government support, through lower car tax rates, grants for charging infrastructure and, in some local authorities, free parking."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Former MP killed in WW1 finally added to Parliament's memorial", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46149900", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:39", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Lancashire County Council/Burnley Borough Council Image caption Gerald Arbuthnot was briefly MP for Burnley\n\nA forgotten hero has finally been remembered on Parliament's World War One memorial.\n\nThe marble installation recognises the sacrifice of peers, MPs, MPs' sons, and senior officers of Parliament, who died in service during the Great War.\n\nBut 96 years after its completion, a leading historian realised one MP had been left off.\n\nNow Lieutenant Gerald Arbuthnot, once the Conservative MP for Burnley, has had his name belatedly added.\n\nThe 44-year-old was killed in action in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.\n\nDr Kathryn Rix, from the History of Parliament Trust, spotted his name's absence from the memorial and said it's not clear why he was forgotten.\n\n\"I think perhaps it was because he wasn't an MP for very long,\" she said. \"Perhaps people didn't remember he was an MP between January and December 1910.\n\n\"Also he was a former MP at the time and they weren't originally added to the memorial in 1921.\n\n\"But then some former MPs were added in 1922, so really, he should have been added at that time.\n\n\"They just forgot him -

So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916.\"\n\nBy May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards.\n\nOn 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs.\n\nLt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment.\n\nDr Rix explained: \"This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed.\"\n\nThe soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt.\n\nDespite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial.\n\nWith the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added.\n\nHis distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years.\n\nBut in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name.\n\nThe Armistice 100 years on\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nLong read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline\n\nVideo: War footage brought alive in colour\n\nInteractive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?\n\nLiving history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended\n\nLord Arbuthnot said: \"I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary story.

Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all.\n\nWorryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over.\n\nPlenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.\n\n'Signs of weakness'\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond said: \"Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy.

There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.\n\n\"However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.\"\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.\n\n\"The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.\"\n\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "'Remarkable' decline in fertility rates", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46118103", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThere has been a remarkable global decline in the number of children women are having, say researchers.\n\nTheir report found fertility rate falls meant nearly half of countries were now facing a \"baby bust\" - meaning there are insufficient children to maintain their population size.\n\nThe researchers said the findings were a \"huge surprise\".\n\nAnd there would be profound consequences for societies with \"more grandparents than grandchildren\".\n\nHow big has the fall been?\n\nThe study, published in the Lancet, followed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017.\n\nIn 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46142276", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:00:54", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year\n\nThe way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck \"in the 18th Century\", leading doctors say.\n\nEvery year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled.\n\nIt said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money.\n\nThe RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations.\n\nGetting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help.\n\nIt said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done.\n\nDr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: \"It's an 18th Century system.

In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears.

They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments.

More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

Officials say the blaze is only 5 percent contained.\n\nIn addition to those found dead in their vehicles, many people in Paradise were forced to abandon their cars, which got stuck in gridlocked traffic, and run for their lives.\n\nDozens more people were reported missing.\n\nCalifornia fire officials said crews gave up fighting the flames Thursday and instead helped people get out alive.\n\n\u201cThese firefighters were in the rescue mode all day yesterday,\u2019\u2019 said Capt. Scott McLean of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cThe town is devastated, everything is destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\nParadise, nearly 145 kilometers north of Sacramento, was home to more than 26,000 residents, according to its website.\n\n\u201cRight now, Mother Nature is in charge,\u201d Cal Fire spokesman Bryce Bennet told The Sacramento Bee newspaper.\n\nMassive evacuations\n\nEvacuations were ordered for the east side of the neighboring town of Chico, a city of about 93,000 people, as flames from the blaze were being driven by 56 kph winds.\n\nAn undetermined number of civilians and firefighters have been injured, and Maclean said earlier it could take days to determine the number of fatalities.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s acting Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the northern part of the state to help facilitate rescue and recovery efforts.\n\nThe fire, known as the Camp Fire, evolved quickly into the fiercest of the wind-driven fires now plaguing California in what has been one of the worst years for wildfires in the state.\n\nAnother fire, known as the Woolsey Fire, prompted officials to call for the voluntary evacuation of some 75,000 homes in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, the site of a mass shooting this week in which 12 people were killed.\n\nThe mayor of Thousand Oaks, where the mass shooting took place, says that three-quarters of his city is under fire evacuation orders.\n\nFire officials said strong Santa Ana winds continued to fuel the Woolsey Fire, doubling its size.\n\nThe blaze also forced the evacuation of all of Malibu, a city of about 13,000 people that is home to many Hollywood celebrities. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted, \u201cimminent threat!,\u201d as the fire raged through the Santa Monica Mountains toward the ocean.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been told to go, get out of there,\u201d Los Angeles County Sheriff Department Chief John Benedict said.\n\nAlso burning further west in Ventura County was the Hill Fire, which fire officials said burned nearly 4,050 hectares by Thursday night.

Ted Lieu, D-Calif. \"We shouldn't be supporting coalition war crimes, and I look forward to continuing to scrutinize the U.S.'s role in Yemen when we're in the majority next Congress.\"\n\nEven as President Donald Trump's administration has condemned Khashoggi's slaying, the White House has sought to preserve its relationship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nAny coordinated decision by Washington and Riyadh to halt refueling could be an attempt by both countries to forestall further action by Congress.\n\nSens. Todd Young, R-Ind., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., had warned the Trump administration was running out of time to act.\n\n\"If the administration does not take immediate steps ... we are prepared to take additional action when the Senate comes back into session,\" Young and Shaheen said.\n\nThe Pentagon, State Department and White House declined to comment.\n\n\u200bMore time for bombers\n\nEarlier this year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended U.S. military support to Saudi-led coalition forces in Yemen, when lawmakers weighed forcing the Pentagon to end Washington's involvement in the conflict.\n\nMattis argued that halting U.S. military support could increase civilian casualties, since U.S. refueling had given pilots more time to select their targets. He told them cutting off support could jeopardize cooperation on counterterrorism and reduce American influence with Saudi Arabia.\n\nMattis also argued it would embolden the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, who have fired missiles at Saudi Arabia and targeted commercial and military vessels off Yemen's coast.\n\nA halt to refueling could have little practical effect on the war. U.S. officials told Reuters only a fifth of Saudi-led coalition aircraft require in-air refueling from the United States.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mattis has appeared to voice a growing sense of urgency toward ending the conflict. At the end of October, Mattis joined U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in calling for a cease-fire."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Russian Billionaire Gets More Time to Cut Aluminum Company Holdings", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-billionaire-gets-more-time-to-cut-aluminum-company-holdings/4652739.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. Treasury Department has again extended a deadline for Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska to reduce his holdings in the aluminum company Rusal before sanctions take effect.\n\nThe Treasury Department said Friday that licenses allowing Rusal to continue doing business would be extended from Dec. 12 to Jan. 7.\n\nThe department said in April that it would impose sanctions on Deripaska and several companies in which he is a large shareholder, citing \"malign activities\" by Russia.\n\nHowever, the agency has pushed back the sanction deadline multiple times since then as it works with the companies, who are looking to find new shareholders.\n\nRusal and its parent En+ Group have been taking steps to change their management to people not linked with Deripaska to ease the sanctions.

Bush.\n\nTrump\u2019s choice of Whitaker to take the helm of the Justice Department and oversee special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election sparked a pushback from congressional Democrats and even some prominent Republicans.\n\nOn Friday, however, Trump seemed to distance himself from Whitaker, leaving the acting attorney general\u2019s future in doubt.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker\u2019\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House before departing for Paris, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions and was always extremely highly thought of and he still is. But I didn\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s assertion directly contradicts what he told Fox News last month, when he said, \u201cI mean, I know Matt Whitaker\u201d and that he is \u201ca great guy.\u201d CNN also reported that Whitaker has visited the White House a dozen or more times since becoming Sessions\u2019 chief of staff and that he had a good relationship with the president.\n\nThe White House doesn\u2019t release lists of visitors. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to questions about the number of times Whitaker has met with and briefed Trump.\n\n\u2018A very interim AG\u2019\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted Friday that a permanent replacement could be named soon for Whitaker, a conservative activist who has frequently voiced skepticism about Mueller\u2019s probe and insisted there was no evidence of collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign officials and the Russians.\n\n\u201cI think this will be a very interim AG (attorney general),\u201d McConnell said.\n\nCandidates for the position include Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, former New Jersey Governor and Trump adviser Chris Christie and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment came Wednesday, shortly after Trump forced out Sessions after months of complaining about the attorney general\u2019s decision, just weeks into taking office, to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia probe. Trump blamed the recusal for Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nMueller investigation\n\nBecause Sessions had recused himself, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein supervised Mueller\u2019s investigation. Now, the task has fallen to Whitaker, and Democrats are demanding that he, too, should recuse himself because of his past criticism of the Mueller investigation.\n\nWhitaker was appointed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a 1998 law that allows the president to appoint any senior official as acting head of an agency for up to 210 days. But some constitutional scholars have questioned the legality of the appointment, citing a constitutional requirement that the attorney general must be approved by the Senate.\n\nBrenna Bird, a county prosecutor in Iowa who worked at Whitaker\u2019s former law firm, said Whitaker, along with Sessions, briefed the president \u201cseveral times\u201d and that Whitaker has gained Trump\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cObviously, the president has a great deal of trust in him (Whitaker) to put him in charge at this time,\u201d Bird said. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump would choose him for this job if he didn\u2019t think he was up to it, and he is.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Vote Tallies Due in Florida\u2019s Tight Senate, Governor Races", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/vote-tallies-due-in-florida-tight-senate-governor-races/4652759.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Unofficial vote tallies in Florida\u2019s elections were due by midday Saturday, which could prompt recounts in the hotly contested races for governor and U.S. Senate.\n\nAt stake was the tight and acrimonious U.S. Senate race between Republican Gov.

Ron DeSantis and the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, might also face a recount.\n\nThe recounts reflect a deeply divided electorate in a state that will play a critical role in the 2020 election and will determine whether Nelson will return to Washington for a fourth term or the Republicans will pad their majority in the Senate.\n\nGillum conceded to DeSantis on Tuesday night, but when the results began to narrow, he said every vote should count. DeSantis has said little about the recount and is instead proceeding as if he won the election, appointing a transition team and preparing to take office in January.\n\nHeated Senate fight\n\nThe battle for Nelson\u2019s Senate seat has been much more heated, with both sides filing lawsuits and trading verbal jabs. Scott has said Nelson is trying to steal the election, while Nelson is accusing Scott of trying to stop elections officials from counting every ballot.\n\nScott had asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections departments in South Florida\u2019s Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties after his lead narrowed in ballot-counting that continued through the week. However, a spokeswoman for the agency said Friday that there were no credible allegations of fraud; therefore, no active investigation.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, filed lawsuits in both counties seeking more information on how their ballots were being tallied. Nelson filed his own federal lawsuit Friday, seeking to postpone the Saturday deadline to submit unofficial election results.\n\nJudges sided with Scott in rulings late Friday ordering election supervisors in the two counties to release information on ballot-counting sought by the governor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Broward Canvassing Board met Friday to review ballots that had been initially deemed ineligible.

The FDA's planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.\n\nThere has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an \"epidemic.\"\n\n\"E-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 trend among teens,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. \"The disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we're seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end.

The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.\n\nThe planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.\n\nJuul competitors\n\nThe only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc.\n\nThose products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nE-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul's business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco's global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.\n\nAltria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA's concerns about teen usage. The company also said it would restrict flavors for its other e-cigarette products to tobacco, menthol and mint.\n\nRepresentatives from Altria, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening. A Juul spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe companies have previously said their products are intended for adult use and that they work to ensure retailers comply with the law.\n\nDivisive products\n\nJuul has previously said the company wants to be \"part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people\" but that \"appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch.\"\n\nMeredith Berkman, a founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes, which seeks to curb underage use, said the agency's move was a \"good first step,\" but added that \"the final step should have happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"Why not do away with flavors altogether, why not do away with online sales altogether?\" she said.\n\nE-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.\n\nLast year the FDA, under Gottlieb, extended until 2022 a deadline for e-cigarette companies to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Prepares to Fight Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-prepares-to-fight-off-ebola-along-drc-border-/4651129.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

The Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, to be exact.\n\nSo could it be that the object, called Oumuamua, Hawaiian for 'scout', is truly some kind of alien artifact, or an actual space probe sent to spy on all us Earthlings?\n\nHate to be a bummer, but no!\n\nLet's throw away our scientific and journalist objectivity for a moment and admit that most people want the answer to be 'yes.'\n\nThat's why scientists spend so much time looking for extrasolar planets that are like Earth, and why we want to get closer looks at Mars, and send probes to Europa or Enceladus or any place with oceans of liquid water. Researchers and astronomers all want some proof that humans are not all alone in the universe.\n\nBut in this case, based on conversations VOA has had with astronomers, and based on everything scientists know about space rocks, comets, and asteroids, Oumuamua doesn't seem to be acting much differently than any other space rock out there in the void.\n\nBut here's what scisntists do know about Oumuamua, and that might help explain why some scientists are so excited about it, whether it offers proof of alien intelligence or not.\n\nOumuamua was the first interstellar object to visit our solar system. That means it came from another star system like our own. It flew between Mercury and the Sun in November 2017, almost exactly a year ago.\n\nIt moved really quickly, at about 136-thousand kilometers per hour. Michele Bannister from Queen's College in Belfast told VOA that scientists only had about three weeks to get a good look at it.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nOumuamua is reddish, and about 400 meters long. However, it's 10 times longer than it is wide, so basically it looks a bit like a giant, dirty interstellar icicle. In space terms, 400 meters is tiny, so just finding the thing was a big win for astronomers.\n\n\u201cFor decades we\u2019ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there,\" says NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen \"and now\u2015for the first time\u2015we have direct evidence they exist.\u201d\n\nThat's really interesting, but how did the whole \"aliens\" thing get started? Well, it turns out that Oumuamua is definitely 'unusual' in that it isn't just ambling through the galaxy. It's changing speed and direction by itself. Bannister calls this \"non-gravitational acceleration.\"\n\nIt turns out that's not particularly strange or even unusual. Bannister says this rock is likely filled with the kinds of things that comets and asteroids generally have in abundance. Carbon monoxide, for instance or cyanide. If so, when they get close to the sun and get warm, these gases shoot out like jets in a process called sublimation. This is likely what made Oumuamua look like it was acting under its own power, because it was in a way.\n\nHere's how NASA explains this outgassing acceleration:\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nWe'll never really know\n\nBut that perfectly reasonable explanation didn't stop Harvard scientists Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from putting forth a few possible alternate possibilities for Oumuamua, including one that suggests our interstellar space rock was a lightsail, a giant sail that uses energy from the sun instead of wind to push a vehicle through space.\n\nThey suggest this might be a possibility because some other studies suggest our interstellar wanderer isn't a comet and isn't doing any outgassing. Hence the solar sail idea. And the team does the math to show how Oumuamua might fit the bill.\n\nThe other possibility put forward by Bialy and Loeb is that \"Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\" They do the math here as well to show how Oumuamua's trajectory might make sense if it was aimed our way.\n\nIt's important to note that the paper hasn't been peer reviewed yet, which is the process all scientific research goes through before it gets published by reputable journals like Science, or Nature. That means other scientists in the same field read it over, give input and check on its validity. So we'll see what happens with this paper.\n\nBut as far as Oumuamua goes, it's too small for even our best telescopes to get a look at, so researchers have all the information they'll ever have.\n\nBut don't worry, there are likely a lot more Oumuamua's out there. \u201cThe galaxy is filled with flying rocks,\u201d Bannister says. \"Trillions upon trillions\" of space rocks, ranging in size from a \"skyscraper\" to a planet, are likely roaming around the galaxy. And if we're lucky, Bannister says we should be able to see about one a year.\n\nSo, in a way the Earth is getting visitors from other stars, but they're just random rocks passing through. So, no aliens, but still pretty really great science."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Experts Turn Old Coal Mines into Carbon-Sucking Forests", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-turn-old-coal-mines-into-carbon-sucking-forests/4649566.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Dramatic steps are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic levels of global warming, says the latest report from the U.N.

It can cause chronic pain, menstrual problems, recurrent urinary tract infections, cysts and infertility. Some girls hemorrhage to death or die from infections. It can also cause fatal childbirth complications in later life.\n\nAnalyzing data spanning more than 20 years, BMJ Global Health said in a study there was a \"huge and significant decline\" in FGM in children under 14 across Africa.\n\nEast Africa had the biggest fall in its prevalence rates, dropping to 8 percent in 2016 from 71 percent in 1995, according to the BMJ study published Tuesday.\n\nIn north Africa, prevalence rates fell to 14 percent in 2015 from nearly 60 percent in 1990, the report said; west Africa dropped to about 25 percent in 2017, from 74 percent in 1996.\n\nUNICEF, the U.N. children\u2019s agency, estimates that 200 million women and girls globally have undergone FGM, with the highest prevalence in Africa and parts of the Middle East.\n\nMore to the story\n\nCampaigners welcomed the drop but said FGM also affects teenagers and young women, demographic groups outside the study.\n\n\"We are pleased to see that the numbers are coming down in a lot of countries,\" said Emma Lightowlers, a spokeswoman for campaign group 28TooMany, which does research on FGM in Africa. \"But it doesn't tell the whole story and there are other groups where cutting takes place after the age of 14.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

Perpetrators historically rarely faced more than a fine, experts say, but can now be sentenced to up to five years in prison thanks to a law that took effect in September.\n\nThe Sexual Harassment Law was passed earlier this year amid an uproar over the arrest and swift release of a man who ejaculated on a fellow bus passenger. The crime was considered a misdemeanor.\n\nThis classification gave perpetrators a sense of impunity and showed a lack of regard for violence against women, said Silvia Chakian, a S\u00e3o Paulo prosecutor who focuses on crimes against women.\n\n\u201cThese cases used to be left in a legislative gap,\u201d Chakian said. \u201cIt was difficult to find a legal framing between \u2018insult to decency,\u2019 which is a misdemeanor with an insignificant penalty, and the crime of rape, which is a more serious crime with prison terms of six to 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe new law defines sexual harassment as a lewd act against someone without their consent that is committed by someone \u201cto satisfy their own lust or that of a third person.\u201d It carries a penalty of one to five years in prison.\n\nBetween Sept. 25, when the law took effect, and Oct. 23, 36 incidents of sexual harassment were reported on buses, trains and subways in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area alone, according to a HuffPost Brazil analysis of transit authority data.\n\nDespite the problem\u2019s persistence, the law is widely seen as a crucial step toward curbing harassment of women in public spaces.\n\nReporting Harassment\n\nThe first arrest for sexual harassment on S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public transit system was made the day after the law took effect.\n\nA woman reported that a man sat next to her on a train and ran his hand over her legs. She got off the train at the next station and reported the incident to security officials, who found the suspect and brought him to police. After an initial hearing, the man was released pending the outcome of his trial, but he is required to check in with authorities each month until the case goes to court, according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Court of Justice.\n\nThe incident was one of 13 cases of sexual harassment reported between Sept. 25 and Oct. 23 on S\u00e3o Paulo trains, according to transit authority data. Six other cases were reported on metro area buses. Seventeen incidents were reported on the city\u2019s subways, and subway officials say 13 of those resulted in arrests.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This file photo from 2013 shows passengers riding escalators to access subway platforms in Sao Paulo.\n\nThe three companies that manage public transportation in the greater S\u00e3o Paulo area advise victims of sexual harassment to immediately seek help from transit employees \u2014 bus drivers or security officials at train and subway stations \u2014 and to identify perpetrators, if possible. Representatives from the companies said they had trained their employees to help these women and have been intensifying campaigns to combat harassment.\n\nMetr\u00f4, the city\u2019s subway authority, allows users to report incidents and send photos and videos to authorities via a mobile app or SMS service. The city\u2019s train authority allows also allows victims to report harassment anonymously through its own SMS service.\n\nUsed Condoms In Bags\n\nBut the reporting system hasn\u2019t been effective for everyone. Clara Novais, a 27-year-old journalist, told HuffPost Brazil that she couldn\u2019t find any subway authority to help her after a man put a used condom in her bag.\n\n\u201cI felt a liquid dripping on me and thought it might be my lunch that was leaking out of my backpack, but when I stopped to look closely, it was actually a used condom,\u201d she said. \u201cI had seen other freaky sexual cases on the subway, and my first reaction was to think, \u2018I do not believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d The alleged incident happened on a train on Oct. 2,10 days after the law took effect.\n\nNovais said she could not find an employee to help her once she got off the train. \u201cI complained on the [train authority] website and published [my account] on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cSo before going to the police station, I was interviewed by some media outlets and went to make the police report at night.\u201d\n\nOther stories began to emerge after Novais went public.\n\nRebecca Barboza, a 25-year-old designer, told HuffPost Brazil she found a condom on her belongings on the same day as Novais.\n\n\u201cIt happened on my birthday. I was already leaving the subway, on the escalator, and was distracted answering texts when I felt something cold on my back,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran my hand over it and smelled something terrible. When I took the backpack off, I saw the condom.\u201d\n\nBarboza went to a bathroom to wash her clothes and said another woman noticed she was visibly shaken. The woman brought Barboza to transit authority staff, who advised her to file a police report at a station inside the terminal.\n\nAuthorities there refused to label the offense as sexual harassment, Barboza said, and instead classified it as a misdemeanor \u201cinsult to decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the time I arrived, I said it was sexual harassment, and the official said it was not,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked why, and he said there was no physical contact.\u201d\n\nI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment. ... We will have to wait to see how the judiciary will deal with it \u2014 what they will and won\u2019t view as sexual harassment. Ana Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists\n\nAna Paula Braga, a lawyer with the Feminist Network of Jurists, said she thought both cases could meet the requirements of harassment under the new law, since condoms have a clear sexual purpose.\n\n\u201cI think putting a used condom in someone\u2019s purse, against her will, without her consent, characterizes sexual harassment,\u201d Braga said. \u201cWhat jurists have been discussing is how the courts will judge this lewd act in practice.

In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \u201cEinsatzgruppen.\u201d\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Donald Trump Blames Deadly California Wildfires On 'Gross Mismanagement' Of Forests", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-california-forest-fires-blame_us_5be6932fe4b0e843889816e0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump has blamed the fast-moving wildfires that are tearing through parts of California, and killed at least nine people, on the \u201cgross mismanagement of the forests.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet early Saturday, Trump said \u201cthere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.\u201d\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.

Whitaker has criticized the inquiry in the past as too wide-ranging, which has raised concerns among Democrats that Sessions\u2019 ouster and Whitaker\u2019s appointment might be precursors to Trump moving to end it.\n\nSenate Democrats were considering suing Trump, the sources said, on the grounds that, in naming Whitaker, the president ignored a statutory line of succession at the Justice Department and deprived senators of their constitutional \u201cadvice and consent\u201d role on some presidential appointments.\n\n\u201cThe only two paths to that office are regular succession, and advice (and) consent,\u201d said a source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Reuters late on Friday he was \u201cconsidering action that might be brought against an interim appointment that violates the normal statutory line of succession and raises very serious constitutional questions.\u201d\n\nHe said he was speaking only for himself and he hoped Republicans might join as plaintiffs if a lawsuit goes forward.\n\nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that some senior government officials, known as \u201cprincipal officers,\u201d must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Trump had the authority to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general temporarily, even though he had not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSuch appointments can be done for senior officials who have worked in the department for at least 90 days and can last for up to 210 days, spokesman George Hartmann said.\n\nAs the minority party in the Senate, Democrats might need some Republican support to have legal standing to sue Trump under the Appointments Clause, said Andrew Wright, who was a White House lawyer under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democrats were unsure whether they would reach out to Republicans to join the lawsuit, but added it was \u201cnot likely.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier this year introduced legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting the probe, said Whitaker did not pose a threat to his work.\n\n\u201cMueller will be allowed to do his job,\u201d Graham said in a Friday interview on Fox News Radio.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said \u201cthe Supreme Court made clear that the Attorney General is a principal officer\u201d in a 1998 case.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Whitaker cannot serve as acting Attorney General ... Any other officer in the Justice Department who was appointed through advice and consent can serve, including the Deputy AG, the solicitor general, and the assistant AGs,\u201d said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career Justice Department official already confirmed by the Senate, should have been named the new attorney general.\n\nRESTRICTIONS ON TRUMP\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia interfered in the 2016 election in an attempt to tip it toward Trump and away from his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins said Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said there was no collusion, and has slammed the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Russia has denied interfering.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about comments that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has made regarding the Special Counsel and the parameters of his investigation,\u201d Collins said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe should bring to the Senate floor legislation that would put restrictions on the ability of President Donald Trump to fire the Special Counsel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House before he left on a trip to Paris, Trump defended his choice of Whitaker, saying the former U.S. attorney for the southern district of Iowa had an excellent reputation and came highly recommended by former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, who is now Trump\u2019s ambassador to China.\n\nIn a late night Tweet on Friday, Trump reiterated that he did not know Whitaker, but that he was very highly thought of by Iowa Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, and Branstad.\n\n\u201cI feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General!,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said on Friday he had not discussed the Mueller investigation with Whitaker before appointing him.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department has said Whitaker would oversee all matters under its jurisdiction, including the Mueller investigation.

And as of Wednesday, Whitaker is serving as attorney general, a role that could give him ultimate oversight into that investigation.\n\nPer the Journal, the investigation is being undertaken by the FBI field office in Miami as well as the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. There\u2019s no indication that Whitaker, who has been acting attorney general for little more than 48 hours, has taken any action or even been briefed on the case. Justice Department ethics officials will undoubtedly call on Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation, though it\u2019s unclear whether he has met with ethics officials at this point.\n\nThe troubled company shut down in 2017, after a federal injunction brought by the Federal Trade Commission, and was ordered to pay a $26 million fine last May.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing two anonymous sources, reported that Whitaker rebuffed an FTC subpoena in 2017 seeking his records related to the company.\n\nAlthough the FTC argued World Patent Marketing was little more than \u201ca scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,\u201d Whitaker saw it differently in a December 2014 press release for the company:\n\n\u201cAs a former US Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business \u2018ethically\u2019 and translates them into action.\u201d\n\nThe revelation about the investigation comes as Whitaker, a little-known Iowa Republican whose relationship with President Donald Trump led to his appointment Wednesday, appears prepared to seize control of the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation in spite of his extensive remarks about the probe as a cable news commentator.\n\nBefore he joined the Justice Department as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff last year, Whitaker routinely disparaged the special counsel investigation in appearances on CNN and on the radio. Whitaker was paid a $402,000 salary by a dark money group called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which criticized Democrats on ethics grounds. FACT was meant to be the conservative answer to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal watchdog group that on Thursday called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point whether Whitaker has been formally looped in on the status of the Mueller probe. Within the Justice Department, there\u2019s little faith that Whitaker will recuse himself from the Mueller investigation, even if DOJ\u2019s career ethics officials recommend he do so.\n\nThe Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment late Friday.\n\nLast month, Trump said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d show that Whitaker \u201cis a great guy\u201d and said that he knew him but declined to talk about any conversations he had had with him about taking on the role.

But nothing is normal about Georgia\u2019s race for governor.\n\nAbrams, who would be the first black female governor in the history of the nation, had to devote an enormous amount of energy during her campaign to fighting the voter suppression tactics of her opponent, who refused to resign his position as secretary of state to run for governor and therefore oversaw his own election. Kemp now holds 50.33 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019 48.72, and a candidate in Georgia has to win at least 50 percent to win the race outright.\n\nAbrams maintains that the hundreds of thousands of people Kemp allegedly blocked from the polls could easily push her to victory, or at least a runoff.\n\nThere were numerous accounts of voting difficulties in Georgia on Tuesday \u2015 particularly for people of color. Voters were denied a ballot and turned away from the polls because they hadn\u2019t voted in the last three years and/or the last two federal elections, and Kemp\u2019s office had purged hundreds of thousands of people from the rolls for \u201cinactivity.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Kemp\u2019s office put 53,000 voter registration applications on hold \u2015 70 percent of them from people of color \u2015 because of the state\u2019s controversial \u201cexact match\u201d law.\n\nVoters in Gwinnett County, a diverse swing district north of Atlanta where Abrams canvassers had focused their turnout efforts, were forced to wait hours in line because the voting machines lacked power cords and ran out of batteries.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign held a press conference Friday with Georgia voters who said they were blocked from the polls for various reasons. One person said she never received the absentee ballot she requested, despite calling the voter hotline for help.

They would be the first humans on the list, which classifies endangered, threatened and vulnerable animal species around the globe.\n\nA video from the advocacy group (see above) makes its point in part by dressing individuals with Down syndrome in costumes resembling such endangered, threatened and vulnerable species as polar bears, lions and rhinos.\n\nThe campaign is a reaction to the fact that genetic screening has led to a significant decrease in people born with Down syndrome.\n\nSince the prenatal tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, for example, almost 100 percent of women who received a positive test for Down syndrome opted for an abortion, according to CBS. As a result, the condition has been almost completely disappeared from Iceland\u2019s younger population.\n\nSome people may believe that eradicating the condition is a good thing. But advocates argue that this kind of attitude contributes to a stigma that people with Down Syndrome are lesser humans. And that kind of thinking impacts societal awareness, funding and job opportunities for those who have Down syndrome and desperately need aid \u2014 hence the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s underfunded support programs for education, higher rates of unemployment, extended waitlists for appropriate housing, or even just negative public perception and stigma, the challenges faced by people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t decreasing \u2014 they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Laura LaChance, the board chair for the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, said in a press release.\n\nThe group told HuffPost Canada that by pushing to add people with Down syndrome to the endangered species list, it\u2019s advocating for the same kinds of \u201cfunding, protections, government intervention and public awareness that species on the Endangered List receive.\u201d\n\nMany people still found the campaign\u2019s comparison of humans to animals dehumanizing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine folks with Down Syndrome would want to be considered a separate species.

Because we don\u2019t talk about it. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nAfter that miscarriage, she and her husband went on to conceive their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, through in vitro fertilization \u2015 a medical procedure in which eggs are extracted from a woman\u2019s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos. If viable embryos are created, they are transferred back into the woman\u2019s body to establish a pregnancy.\n\nObama hinted in the ABC interview that the couple turned to IVF due to an issue with egg quality.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized that as I was 34 and 35 \u2015 we had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for people facing infertility problems say that the revelation from one of the most admired women in America will help others feel less alone.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Michelle Obama Reveals She Used IVF To Conceive Her Daughters", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-daughters-ivf_us_5be57e9ae4b0769d24cc3eab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-10 09:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Michelle Obama says she felt \u201clost and alone\u201d after having a miscarriage 20 years ago and underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive her two daughters.\n\n\u201cI felt like I failed because I didn\u2019t know how common miscarriages were because we don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d the former first lady said in an interview broadcast Friday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u2033We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nMrs. Obama, 54, said she and Barack Obama underwent fertilization treatments to conceive daughters Sasha and Malia, now 17 and 20.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: @MichelleObama to @RobinRoberts on suffering a miscarriage 20 years ago: \u201cI felt lost and alone.\u201d More coming up on @GMA and then watch the @ABC special covering her journey to motherhood and more from her memoir, \"Becoming,\" Sunday night 9/8c. https://t.co/LivWLBgeRA pic.twitter.com/gzIe8LTYC2 \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) November 9, 2018\n\n\u201cI realized that as I was 34 and 35,\u201d the famously fit Mrs. Obama said in excerpts from an ABC special set to air Sunday. \u201cWe had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nThe revelations come ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of Mrs. Obama\u2019s memoir \u201cBecoming,\u201d in which she writes openly about everything from growing up in Chicago to confronting racism in public life and becoming the country\u2019s first black first lady.\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of \u201cBecoming,\u201d one of the most anticipated political books in recent memory.
