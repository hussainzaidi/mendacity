It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"This may seem hard to believe, but today is one of the most meaningful days of my life,\" Cohen added later. \"I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired.\"\n\nInside the courtroom, Cohen's family was visibly emotional. Cohen did not speak to reporters upon leaving the courthouse.\n\nHe previously pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts brought by federal prosecutors in New York, and received 36 months for those crimes. Cohen also pleaded guilty to one count of lying to Congress from Mueller's team, for which he was sentenced to two months.\n\nCohen will serve the sentences concurrently.\n\nUS District Judge William Pauley described the crimes that Cohen had pleaded guilty to as \"a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct\" before announcing his sentence.\n\nPauley also ordered Cohen to pay $1.39 million in restitution, forfeit $500,000 and pay a $50,000 fine. Cohen was ordered to report to prison in March.\n\n'Eroded faith in the electoral process'\n\nCohen's attorney, Guy Petrillo, offered a sweeping case for leniency, comparing the significance of Cohen's actions and the work of the special counsel to the Watergate investigation.\n\n\"The cooperation here should be viewed against a non-standard framework,\" Petrillo said. The special counsel's office \"investigation is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate.\"\n\nPetrillo described the stakes of Cohen's cooperation with Mueller to the courtroom, saying that when Cohen came forward to help the special counsel, \"he knew the President might shut down the investigation,\" and later describing Cohen's time working for Trump as a \"misfortune.\"\n\n\"He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country,\" Petrillo said.\n\nHowever, Assistant US Attorney Nicholas Roos, who spoke on behalf of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, told the courtroom Cohen's campaign finance crimes carried a \"tremendous societal cost.\"\n\n\"In committing these crimes, Mr. Cohen has eroded faith in the electoral process and compromised the rule of law,\" Roos said.\n\nCohen, Trump's former lawyer, pleaded guilty in August to two campaign finance violations tied to payments he had made or orchestrated to women during the campaign to stay silent about alleged sexual encounters with Trump, five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a bank. Trump has denied the affairs.\n\nIn that filing, prosecutors say that Cohen \"acted in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump in executing the payments.\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty last month to a charge from Mueller's office of lying to Congress about how long discussions involving a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow had extended into the 2016 campaign.\n\nPetrillo added that Cohen couldn't \"anticipate the full measure of attack that would be made against him -- not only by the President, who continues to say that people who cooperate like Mr. Cohen are weaklings ... but also attacks by partisans and citizens who happen to be aligned with the President. And those attacks include threats against his family.\"\n\nAdditionally, without naming Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Petrillo appeared to offer up a stark comparison between the two men, who are currently at the center of the investigation by the special counsel.\n\n\"His action stands in profound contrast to the decision of some others not to cooperate and allegedly to double deal while pretending to cooperate,\" Petrillo said.\n\nFollowing Petrillo's remarks, Jeannie Rhee spoke for the special counsel. She only appeared for a minute or two, and summarized what was in their memo released Friday and said of Cohen: \"He has told the truth.\"\n\nCooperation with Mueller\n\nIn addition to the disclosures from the US Attorney's office in Manhattan about Trump's participation in the payments to silence women, Mueller also supplied fresh revelations on the President on Friday, disclosing new information on a set of efforts to communicate between Trump, his associates and the Russian government.\n\nIn one instance, prosecutors said, Cohen told the special counsel he had consulted with Trump about his interest in contacting the Russian government before Cohen suggested in a radio interview in September 2015 that Trump meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin during Putin's visit to New York that fall.\n\nCohen had previously claimed his comments on air were spontaneous, the court papers said, but he admitted to prosecutors that they came about after his discussion with Trump.\n\nCohen's sentencing underscores the scope and breadth Mueller's probe has taken as it's investigated the ties between Russia and Trump's team, an examination that often has consumed the President for the first half of his term.\n\nSeveral senior Trump officials have pleaded guilty in the special counsel's investigation, including Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, but none were as close to the President for as long as Cohen.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Lawyer: Cohen had 'misfortune' of being counsel to the President", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/m-MkJUCzyAI/h_3d35860f388d93c6d72a6ea605823a50", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said Cohen has been treated unlike other defendants by prosecutors, noting that \"Mr. Cohen had the misfortune to have been counsel to the President.\"\n\nCohen long served as the President's personal attorney and Trump's \"fixer.\" Cohen even once boasted he would \"take a bullet\" to protect his longtime boss.\n\nPetrillo, in court today, said Cohen wants to cooperate but that \"he\u2019s wary of a long term cooperation agreement.\"\n\n\"He wants both to remove himself and remove his family from the glare of the cameras,\" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Scaramucci: Trump has a soft spot for Cohen", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ZNGl2wwsUtw/scaramucci-trump-cohen-soft-spot-sentencing-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said he is sad to see Michael Cohen face a prison sentence, and he believes President Trump feels the same way after years of working with Cohen."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "How Cohen could help the feds get the Trump Organization", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/itLEE0Kg14c/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "New York (CNN) In most respects, Michael Cohen was a frustrating witness for New York investigators.\n\nHe toyed with, but wouldn't commit to, \"full cooperation\" with prosecutors, according to court filings.

The inquiry stems from the original campaign-finance charges against Cohen for making or orchestrating payments during the presidential campaign to silence women -- adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal -- who claimed sexual encounters with Trump. (Trump has denied those claims.)\n\nIn the court papers filed against Cohen in August, and again last week, prosecutors referenced several unnamed Trump Organization executives and employees who directed or participated in a scheme to reimburse Cohen for the payments, and prosecutors have been examining whether people within the company should be charged as part of that effort.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "May vows to fight no-confidence vote with 'everything I've got'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/aeEpuB7KK1Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May has told Conservatives lawmakers she will not fight the next general election in 2022, a member of parliament attending the meeting told CNN.\n\nThe pledge came as May was making her final pitch to Conservative Members of Parliament on Wednesday evening before they started voting in a secret ballot which began at 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET).\n\nThe Prime Minister \"got a real grilling, but overall solid support\" as she made her case to Conservative lawmakers, a separate pro-May MP told CNN.\n\nTheresa May addresses the media outside 10 Downing Street after it was announced that the Conservative Party will hold a vote of no confidence in her leadership.\n\nMay vowed to fight for her political life Wednesday morning after a vote of no-confidence in her leadership was called by members of her own party over her handling of Brexit.

Border security has been tightened, authorities said.\n\nDeputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez earlier told France Inter radio station that while authorities had secured the border and set up a perimeter around Strasbourg, they were unsure if the suspect was still in France.\n\nSwiss police said they were \"on alert\" and in close contact with their French counterparts.

Heitz had earlier said the destination was Neuhof, a more distant district of Strasbourg.\n\n\"The taxi driver stated that he had seen him in possession of a handgun and he had injuries,\" said Heitz.

The UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres on Wednesday said it would be \"suicidal\" for these global warming negotiations to fail.\n\nRegenvanu stood at a lectern wearing a green tie and glasses, indicting the global community.\n\n\"[P]arty negotiators rocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience,\" he told diplomats on Tuesday. \"There is no political argument to counter atmospheric measurements showing that CO2 emissions have risen since Paris and are on track for a 2.7% rise in 2018,\" he said, referencing the 2015 UN climate negotiations in Paris -- a moment when the world stood in unison demanding an end to fossil fuels. \"Whether you 'welcome' or 'note' or shamelessly ignore the science all together, the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity.\"\n\nIn the guarded world of climate diplomacy, Regenvanu's statement is a massive burn to the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Over the weekend, those nations refused to \"welcome\" the latest scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which makes clear urgent action is needed to avoid catastrophe, including superstorms, deadlier heatwaves and floods. Those countries instead asked to simply \"note\" the report's existence. The United States issued a statement questioning the well-established science. As did Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The time for limitless negotiations on climate change has passed,\" Regenvanu said. \"It pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate induced tragedies while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris Guidelines,\" he added, \"and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity's most existential threat.\"\n\nA US State Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on that critique.\n\nImportant aspects of the talks, which aim to create rules for tracking carbon emissions cuts as part of the Paris Agreement, which was hashed out three years ago, have become \"a huge mess,\" said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a research group based in the UK.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is that many countries are exploring the bottom of the drain when it comes to ambition -- and in a surprising way,\" said Hare, who is a climate scientist and physicist. \"For those in the scientific community following this here, the levels of concern are rising.\" The rules as they were being discussed early Wednesday would allow for \"massive loopholes\" and \"double counting\" that would create confusion about how much countries really were doing to curb greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, he said. It's so bad that he's started to wonder if it might be better for countries not to agree on anything at all -- rather than to codify lasting rules that are weak to the point of irrelevance.\n\nHare's teenage kids have been asking him if the whole process is, in fact, irrelevant.\n\n\"If at that moment we can't see progress then people can legitimately ask what is going on with this,\" Hare said. \"What exactly is this (Paris) Agreement doing -- and how can it be fixed? Right now, I think concern is rising but the moment of truth is not quite there yet.\"\n\nThe final test, Hare said, will be 2020, when countries submit updated pollution-reduction plans.\n\nJeff Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said the discord is a sign that \"this process is not working.\" \"Leading countries -- especially the United States -- are fighting hard against,\" the Paris rulebook, he said. \"These meetings go on and on. It's very sad ... There are not more than a handful of countries that are going to determine the fate of the world.\"\n\nJennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said a severe lack of leadership at the UN COP24 talks is resulting in mass confusion at this \"critical\" stage. It's like the talks inside this sterile conference center are on another planet from the real world, she said, where wildfires, storms and other climate calamities are becoming more severe, where the science of climate change never has been starker, and where people are demanding action.\n\n\"There is a way forward, but it requires leadership,\" she said. \"That's the gap -- the leadership.\"\n\nInstead, said Eliza Northrop, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, there's \"bickering\" about basic science showing more than 1.5 degrees of warming would be disastrous. People already have warmed the climate 1 degree since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nCOP24 talks are being held in Katowice, Poland, which is the heart of European coal country. Poland has the reputation for being a laggard in climate negotiations and some observers say the country's leadership at the talks has been lacking, perhaps related to those interests.\n\nThe COP President, Micha\u0142 Kurtyka, from Poland, told delegates late Tuesday that there had been \"insufficient progress\" at the talks. That was bold considering the sensitivities, said Jake Schmidt, who directs the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Schmidt said no one is expecting wild success from COP24 -- they best to hope for is a \"B\" grade, he said. It's worrying that these rules don't often get stronger as negotiations trod on, he said. \"It's rare that the thing gets better. It does sometimes. Paris was a rare exception,\" he said. \"It's pretty rare to start with a low bar and work your way up at this stage ...\"\n\nDelegations from rich countries with some moral high-ground -- Germany, New Zealand and Canada, among them -- are not doing enough to rally support, observers said. The United States used to fill that role as a sheep herder, said Hare, but is noticeably absent here. US President Donald Trump's administration promotes increased coal extraction and questions the basics of climate change, despite longstanding scientific consensus that burning coal, oil and natural gas for electricity and other purposes dangerously warms the atmosphere. The US delegation drew protests here this week at an event promoting fossil fuels and technology.\n\nThe negotiations are expected to continue through Friday or likely beyond.\n\n\"The window of opportunity is closing,\" said UN Secretary-General Guterres. \"We no longer have the luxury of time.

Her case has prompted a backlash in China, alarmed businesses around the world and put Canada in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\n\n\"If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u2014 which is a very important thing \u2014 what's good for national security \u2014 I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\" Trump told Reuters in an interview published shortly after Meng was granted bail by a judge in Vancouver.\n\nBy casting Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, as a potential bargaining chip in the trade talks, Trump has undermined the stance taken by senior officials in his administration that the case is strictly a law enforcement matter. It also provides more fuel for Chinese accusations that Meng's detention is politically motivated.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nMeng's next court date\n\nAfter spending 10 days in jail, she now faces a lengthy legal battle over whether she should be extradited to the United States, where prosecutors accuse her of helping Huawei get around sanctions on Iran.\n\nAs a condition of her release, she has agreed to surrender her passports and live in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver. She will also wear a GPS ankle bracelet and pay for an around-the-clock security detail, measures her legal team proposed to assuage concerns that she might return to China.\n\nThe United States has 60 days from the date of a provisional arrest to provide Canada with its formal extradition request and supporting documents. Canada's Justice Department then has 30 days to decide whether to give the go-ahead for a hearing in which the request is weighed by a judge.\n\nThe process of approving or denying the US government's request is expected to take months. Meng is next due back in court on February 6.\n\nA Chinese protester outside Meng Wanzhou's bail hearing in Vancouver. Meng's arrest has prompted a nationalist backlash in China.\n\nChina's tech ambitions\n\nMeng's arrest has set alarm bells ringing at Huawei, which is a vital part of China's efforts to become a global tech powerhouse. It sells more smartphones than Apple ( AAPL ) and builds telecommunications networks in countries around the world.\n\nHuawei, which is widely viewed by US government officials as a national security risk, has repeatedly said it's unaware of any wrongdoing by Meng and insisted it follows all the laws and regulations where it operates.\n\nThe risk for Huawei is that the US case against Meng could evolve into a broader move against the company. The US government paralyzed Huawei's smaller rival, ZTE ( ZTCOF ), for months earlier this year by blocking it from buying vital American-made parts. It did something similar to a Chinese chipmaker last month.\n\nThat kind of move against Huawei would have much wider consequences and potentially disrupt China's efforts to lead the global introduction of 5G, the future of wireless technology.\n\nAfter Meng's arrest, Beijing's 5G ambitions are hanging by \"a thin thread,\" analysts at investment bank Jefferies wrote in a research note Friday.\n\nUS-China trade talks\n\nTrump's suggestion that he could use Meng as leverage in trade talks with China contradicts what his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said just days ago.\n\n\"It's entirely a criminal justice matter,\" Lighthizer said Sunday of Meng's case during an interview on CBS. \"It has nothing to do with anything I'm working on.\"\n\nFaced with a slowing economy and slumping financial markets, Chinese leaders are eager to reach a trade deal with the United States to prevent the trade war doing even more damage, analysts say.\n\nBut Meng's case is a wild card. It has already fueled a nationalist backlash against American products from some Chinese businesses. If the Huawei executive is extradited to the United States, experts warn US and Canadian businesses in China could face retaliation.\n\nThe detention this week of a former Canadian diplomat working for a nonprofit group in Beijing has added to jitters among Western executives over whether they or their colleagues could get caught up in tit-for-tat reprisals."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "157 new species discovered in Asia", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/_Wr98vIjdEI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A bat which looks like *NSYNC's Lance Bass, a gibbon named for Luke Skywalker, and a toad which seems to have come \"from Middle Earth,\" are among 157 new species discovered in the Greater Mekong Region last year, according to a new report from the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nThree mammal, 23 fish, 14 amphibian, 26 reptile and 91 plant species were found in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, in some of the region's most impenetrable terrain, such as remote mountainous and dense jungle areas, as well as isolated rivers and grassland.\n\nHowever, experts warned that many more undiscovered species will be lost due to deforestation, climate change, poaching and the illegal wildlife trade.\n\n\"There are many more species out there waiting to be discovered and tragically, many more that will be lost before that happens,\" Stuart Chapman, WWF's Asia-Pacific Regional Director for Conservation Impact, said in a statement . \"It doesn't have to be this way.

The news illustrates a disturbing trend, civil rights groups say.\n\nOn Friday, December 7, a fire destroyed a Jehovah's Witnesses house of worship. It was the fifth attack this year targeting the religious group in Washington state, federal officials said.\n\nThe next day, a black man was assaulted at a bar in Lynnwood, Washington, by eight self-professed members of a neo-Nazi skinhead group, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Members of the group allegedly yelled racist slurs during the incident, and an employee identified as an Asian man was injured as he tried to intervene.\n\nOn Sunday, Pittsburgh officials said that anti-Semitic pamphlets were being spread throughout the city, including in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the site of a mass shooting that targeted Jews in October. The same day, Nazi-themed posters were found in various locations around the State University of New York's Purchase College. A student was arrested in connection with the posters and charged with a hate crime, the Westchester County District Attorney's Office said.\n\nOn Monday, a 21-year-old man was arrested for allegedly plotting to kill worshipers in a Jewish synagogue in Toledo, officials said.\n\nThe recent headlines reflect a broader trend, according to civil rights groups. There's been a rise in reports of such incidents over the past three years, they say -- a trend that is also borne out by federal data.\n\nEach year, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) releases the Hate Crime Statistics report based on incidents law enforcement agencies submit to the FBI. In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, hate crime reports rose by about 17% from 2016.\n\nAnd that estimate may well be a low estimate. Reporting of hate crimes to the FBI is notoriously low , and an analysis of the 2017 UCR report by the Arab American Institute found that some apparent hate crimes that made headlines were not included in the report.\n\nNumerous factors account for the low rates of reporting, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute. Reporting is voluntary, and different law enforcement agencies follow different state laws or internal policies that dictate reporting of hate crimes.\n\nSteady increases in hate crimes numbers since 2015\n\nIn 2015, reports of anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 67% , according to FBI numbers, from 154 incidents in 2014 to 257 in 2015.\n\nCivil rights groups say it was a turning point, with the following years showing a steady year-to-year increase.\n\nThe next year, 2016, hate crimes reached a historic high. There was a surge in reports around the time of the 2016 presidential election , and reports continued to rise in 2017. Of 7,106 single-bias hate crimes reported in 2017 , 59.6% of victims were targeted because of their race, ethnicity or ancestry; 20.6% were targeted because of their religion; and 15.8% were targeted because of their sexual orientation.\n\nOf the 5,060 victims targeted for their race , ethnicity or ancestry, 48.6% were attacked because of the offenders' anti-Black or African-American bias. Of the 1,749 anti-religious hate crimes, 58.1% were the product of anti-Jewish bias.\n\n\"Rising hate crimes continue to be a reality in America,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. \"The rash of incidents we've seen recently are a reminder that we need to be vigilant against hate and anti-Semitism in all forms.\"\n\nWhile hate is not new to America, experts say the divisive political climate and the rise of hate speech, among other factors, are emboldening people to act on hateful impulses.\n\nThe Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 was a byproduct of that emboldened hate, said Nadia Aziz of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nMainstream America was seemingly caught off guard by scenes of torch-wielding white nationalists chanting racist and anti-Semitic slurs. Tensions boiled over as counterprotesters clashed with rally participants, and a Nazi sympathizer killed one person and injured dozens more with his car. But anti-hate groups say white supremacists and far-right extremist groups have been gathering momentum online and in underground movements for years.\n\nThe driver in the Charlottesville incident, James Fields, was convicted in state court of first-degree murder in Heather Heyer's death, and on nine more charges stemming from the incident.\n\nBut the Charlottesville case demonstrates how statistics can be unreliable -- the FBI's 2017 data does not appear to include Fields' case, even though he also faces 30 federal hate crime charges stemming from the incident.\n\nHeyer was killed on August 12, 2017. But Charlottesville police did not report any incidents in the third quarter, the data shows . The agency only reported one incident in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nFBI data paints an incomplete picture\n\nAnother reason why statistics don't tell the full story is because many crime victims don't report to law enforcement, said Logan Casey, policy researcher with Movement Advancement Project, which tracks laws and policies affecting the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Given that only some jurisdictions keep statistics on hate crimes, and that as many as half of crime victims don't report their experiences to authorities, it's difficult to know the true incidence of these crimes,\" he said in an email.\n\nAlthough the LGBT community is not reflected in the series of apparent hate crimes of the past few days, \"one of the trends we're seeing is a rise in hate crimes against LGBT people,\" he said. He pointed to data suggesting that 25 transgender people in have been murdered in the US this year, a record high for another year in a row.\n\n\"The vast majority of these victims are transgender women of color, illustrating the intersections of racist and anti-LGBT violence.\"\n\nCivil rights groups say it remains to be seen if the recent incidents are reported to the FBI or counted in the UCR's report next year.\n\nWhat might be behind the trend\n\nNo single factor explains the apparent increase in hate incidents, experts say.\n\n\"Part of the problem is the increasing mainstream acceptance of hate speech and online hate,\" Greenblatt, of the Anti-Defamation League said.\n\n\"Words have consequences. It's time for all leaders to step forward and clearly denounce hate. After the tragedy the Jewish community witnessed in Pittsburgh, it is not just something that we as Americans are asking of our leaders -- but something we should come to expect.\"\n\nAziz, Berry and Logan attributed the rise of hate crimes to divisive rhetoric from the Trump administration pertaining to marginalized communities, including immigrants and people of color, as well as policies that undermine the rights of those groups.\n\nThe White House has not responded to CNN's request for a response to those allegations.\n\n\"The President of the United States, both from his social media presence and his remarks during formal White House events, is regularly referring to fear as a motive for policy,\" Berry said. \"We're seeing the presidential bully pulpit being used to divide and spread fear, and without question that has consequences in real peoples' lives.\"\n\nThe upshot of the present state of affairs is that more groups are emerging to support victims of hate -- and more people appear to be reporting incidents of bias, Aziz said.\n\nAziz heads up the group's Stop Hate Project , which works to ensure individuals and organizations have resources to combat hate in their communities. Hate crimes require proof of the additional element of bias to the underlying crime, which makes it different from other crimes, especially in states with narrow categories of protected classes, she said.\n\nAcknowledging that many communities may not feel comfortable reporting to law enforcement, Aziz urged victims to go to police whenever possible -- or to find someone to advocate on their behalf. She suggested calling the Lawyers' Committee hotline, or reporting an incident through a community group's website.\n\nIf someone paints swastikas or racist slurs on a home or public property, Aziz advised documenting those examples before covering them up.\n\n\"As we talk hate crimes more and more, I hope people will be more comfortable about talking about them when they're targeted,\" she said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Sentencing of Heather Heyer's killer shows 'we will not tolerate hate,' mother says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/-dSOQ6k9rYc/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Heather Heyer was killed in Charlottesville just as she and her mother had navigated some growing pains and learned to enjoy each other's company, her mother said Wednesday\n\nSpeaking the day after Heyer's killer was sentenced to life in prison plus 419 years , Susan Bro told CNN that while they weren't best friends, they had become friends, making her killing at an August 2017 white nationalist rally \"a punch in the jaw.\"\n\n\"I'd finally gotten through the adolescent years, which were tough.

He pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the then-Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn initially denied -- but eventually admitted -- that they had discussed sanctions and a United Nations Security Council resolution during the presidential transition. The saga -- including the fact that he had lied to high-ranking administration officials about his contact with Kislyak -- led to his early exit from the White House.\n\nFlynn has long been suspected to be a central figure in an obstruction of justice inquiry focused on Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey around that time, who was overseeing the investigation of Flynn.\n\nTuesday's filing detailed his account of meeting with FBI investigators near the beginning of the Trump administration, and after Flynn had assumed the role of national security adviser. The memo acknowledges criticism of FBI officials and their actions in the days before Mueller's appointment to lead the Russia probe -- though Flynn still says he takes full responsibility for his lies.\n\nThe FBI chose not to involve the Justice Department when it first approached Flynn at the end of January 2017 to discuss his communications with Russians, Flynn's defense team said, citing evidence they had reviewed before his sentencing.\n\nFormer FBI agent Peter Strzok and another FBI agent visited Flynn at his office in the West Wing on January 24, 2017, when he first made the false statements. He did not have an attorney with him at that time, and was not warned he could be prosecuted for making false statements, his memo said.\n\nThe FBI \"decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed, and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport,\" an FBI agent wrote, according to the evidence cited by the defense team.\n\nThen-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who spoke to Flynn before the visit, said that if \"Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting, like the White House Counsel for instance, that I would need to involve the Department of Justice. (General Flynn) stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants.\"\n\nFlynn was in a good mood when he met with the agents that day, the memo said. He \"clearly saw the FBI agents as allies,\" an FBI agent reported.\n\nFlynn's defense attorneys said in the memo that even though the FBI agents involved have been hampered by criticism, the former national security adviser continued to own up to lying.\n\n\"Even when circumstances later came to light that prompted extensive public debate about the investigation of General Flynn, including revelations that certain FBI officials involved in the January 24 interview of General Flynn were themselves being investigated for misconduct, General Flynn did not back away from accepting responsibility for his actions,\" the defense team wrote.\n\nBefore he pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017, Flynn shared information with Mueller five times, then spoke to the Justice Department 14 additional times following his plea.\n\nHe's also given the Department of Justice \"thousands of documents,\" including from his two companies. In all, he's spent 62 hours and 45 minutes speaking with Mueller and other government investigators, according to his defense lawyers' memo Tuesday night.\n\nHis attorneys do not detail the date Flynn first spoke with the special counsel's office.\n\nDifferent from other Mueller cases\n\nFlynn's attorneys compared his case with those of defendants in the special counsel's probe who've gone to prison -- arguing his situation is much different.\n\nTwo other defendants -- the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- served 30 days and 14 days, respectively, after pleading to the same crime as Flynn: lying to investigators. But neither of those men helped Mueller with his investigation to the same extent or were as willing to cooperate and accepting of responsibility, write Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, Flynn's attorneys.\n\nAmong 13 cases where defendants in DC federal court went to sentencing for lying to the federal government, only van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos received prison sentences. The attorneys argued Flynn shouldn't face the same penalty as those two men, who were warned about the seriousness of the Russia investigation and the consequences they would face for lying when they first spoke to investigators.\n\nThe memo to federal Judge Emmet Sullivan, who will single-handedly determine Flynn's sentence, came accompanied Tuesday night with 50 letters of support from family members, friends and members of the US military, where Flynn ranked as a lieutenant general in the Army. The letters collectively attest to his character, sense of family and country, and service in the military and intelligence community.\n\nJack Keane, the former vice chief of staff of the Army who oversaw the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, described Flynn as an officer who \"single handily changed how we created, processed and used intelligence during combat\" after September 11, 2001.\n\n\"There is no doubt that Mike's contribution was consequential to mission success and the preservation of life,\" Keane wrote to the judge. \"I trust Mike completely and always will.\"\n\nOthers write about how the brother to eight grew up a competitive football and water polo player in Rhode Island, then became a diligent military member and later worked in intelligence.\n\nHis work for Trump, however, on both the 2016 presidential campaign and for less than a month in the administration, are minimized in the descriptions to the judge.\n\nHis sister, Clare Eckert, acknowledged that era of his life and the charges he faces since working for Trump.\n\n\"Little did I, or anyone in our family, realize what the future would hold for Michael and all of us who have all been profoundly affected by the devastating events that have transpired over the last few years,\" she wrote. Even so, Flynn continues to be \"the rock for all of us.\"\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump dismisses Russia contacts as 'peanut stuff' after previous denials", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/69rimeyVDXE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump tried to brush off a question in a recent interview about his associates' interactions with Russians ahead of and during his presidential campaign by saying it was just \"peanut stuff,\" despite his earlier blanket denials of any such interactions.\n\n\"The stuff you're talking about is peanut stuff,\" Trump said during a Reuters interview published late Tuesday, before pivoting to criticizing his 2016 Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nBefore he took office and early in the administration, Trump and his senior officials repeatedly denied any contact between members of the Trump campaign team and Russians.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with Russia.

He anticipates that it will continue to rise, partially because of climate change.\n\nThe most common cause of injury is bites from non-venomous arthropods, the group that includes spiders, mosquitoes, ticks and centipedes. As temperatures rise, the habitats of some of these creatures will get larger as they will be able to survive in more places, meaning they are able to injure more people.\n\nThe habitats of larger animals, such as bears, are overlapping more and more with human developments and recreational activities, as well, so injuries from these animals could also increase, the study says.\n\n\"We looked at approximately 20% of the emergency departments in the United States over a span of five years, so 2010 to 2014, and we looked at all the patients who came in who had diagnosis codes that corresponded to animal injury,\" said Dr. Joseph Forrester , one of the authors of the study published Tuesday in the BMJ.\n\nOver the five-year period, over 6 million emergency department admissions were linked to animal-related injuries. That works out to 1,291,507 people annually, or 19 injuries per 10,000 visits.\n\nThe data came from the Nationwide Emergency Department Survey by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Forrester and his co-authors used the World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases to identify those who visited the emergency department with animal-related injuries.\n\n\"First and foremost, the most common injury associated with an animal is not actually a bear or alligator, bottom line, it's actually things much smaller,\" said Forrester, a trauma surgery and critical care fellow at Stanford University.\n\nNearly half of the injuries, 41%, were related to bites from non-venomous arthropods. Dog bites were the next highest cause, accounting for 26% of the injuries. Third were bites and stings from hornets, wasps and bees, which made up 13% of the injuries.\n\nThe largest percentage of ER visits for animal-related injuries -- 42% -- was in the South.\n\nAnother important point noted in the study \"is that those people with the lowest incomes, and likely poor housing, are most impacted by the types of injuries that cause the most severe outcomes,\" Lorann Stallones , director of the graduate degree program in public health at the Colorado School of Public Health at Colorado State University, wrote in an email.\n\nThe study found that the highest group of patients, 34%, were in the lowest 25% household income for their ZIP code. These were also the patients most likely to be injured by bites from venomous snakes, spiders and arthropods.\n\n\"This finding has implications for public health prevention programs targeting injury reduction from preventable causes,\" said Stallones, who was not involved in the research.\n\nOnly 3% of those who were seen in an emergency department were admitted to the hospital. One-third of hospital admissions came from non-venomous arthropod bites. Those who had isolated abdominal injuries were most likely to be admitted to the hospital or die.\n\nAlthough there were a multitude of injuries in the study period, there were only 1,162 deaths, accounting for 0.02% of the emergency visits. Of those deaths, 278 came after a bite from a non-venomous arthropod, the largest number from a single cause.\n\nRat bites were the mechanism of injury with the highest frequency of deaths: 6.5 deaths per 10,000 bites. Bites from venomous snakes and lizards followed closely. Dog bites were responsible for the third highest rate of deaths.\n\nOne possible explanation for the higher frequency of deaths after rat bites could be diseases associated with them, according to Dr. Christopher Holstege , a professor of emergency medicine and pediatrics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Some of these diseases and infections include staphylococcus, rat bite fever and cellulitis.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that \"in addition to causing pain, injury, or nerve damage, dog bites can become infected, putting the bite victim at risk for illness or in rare cases death.\"\n\nHolstege pointed out that due to the codes used to identify animal injuries, \"it's hard for them to delve further into exactly why certain animals were related to mortality or related to admissions.\"\n\n\"I think what this article really does is give us a better snapshot in the modern era of the cost associated, and when you start looking at the cost and start trying to decrease health care costs, it's good to get data like this out so that we can also look at prevention efforts,\" said Holstege, who was not involved with the research.\n\nDog bites and non-venomous arthropods were the two most costly types of injuries, costing $1.36 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, over the five years analyzed. These categories, along with injuries from venomous snakes and lizards, which cost $898 million, accounted for approximately 60% of all the costs.\n\nHolstege suggests that the costs associated with venomous snake and lizard injuries could be due to the antidotes required.\n\nLooking at other methods of care is another way the costs could be decreased, according to Holstege.\n\n\"Very few of these cases were admitted to the hospital,\" he said. \"The question is, how many actually needed to go to an emergency department, and could costs have been decreased by either calling the poison center if it's envenomation with something that's poisonous, or talking to a primary care doctor?\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe authors note that the total cost of these injuries over the five-year period is $5.96 billion. However, there are also costs on top of this, including physician, outpatient and rehabilitation costs and costs of work lost.\n\nIf you are attacked by an animal, Forrester, Stallones and Holstege all advise seeking immediate medical attention, whether from an emergency department, a primary care physician or a poison control center."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "More violence and STIs when sex work is criminalized", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/FRueeCwtSnM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Sex workers across 33 countries who face repressive policing -- identified as arrest, imprisonment, confiscation of needles, syringes, condoms, displacement to new area or physical or sexual violence by officers -- have a three times higher chance of experiencing physical or sexual violence, according to a new study.\n\nThey were twice as likely to have HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases than sex workers who were not exposed to repressive police violence and abuse of power. The group facing repressive policing was also more likely to have poorer mental health, reports the study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine.\n\nLucy Platt, the lead researcher and an associate professor in public health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that \"repressive police practices increase harms\" for sex workers. The paper also states that policy reform is needed to improve sex workers' safety.\n\nPeter Greenhouse, spokesman and sexual health consultant for the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, agreed. \"This new comprehensive research definitively proves what we've known for many years,\" Greenhouse, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. \"That repressive policing against sex workers increases violence against women and reduces access to sexual health care.\"\n\nSex workers, on average, are 13 times more at risk of HIV than the general population, according to the UK-based charity Avert , which provides HIV education. This is because they are economically vulnerable, are unable to negotiate condom use every time, and experience violence, criminalization and marginalization, Avert says.\n\nThe study looked at peer-reviewed research papers between 1990 and 2018 on sex work, legislation, policing and health. Data from 33 countries, including the UK, was used to estimate the average effects of repressive policing, compared with the effects that sex workers experienced in the absence of this.\n\nSex workers who were not exposed to repressive policing were 30% less likely to have condom-less sex than peers in repressive environments. The risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases doubled and the risk of experiencing physical or sexual violence tripled in sex workers in repressive environments.\n\nBritish campaign collective SWARM, which advocates for the rights of sex workers, connected CNN with one of its members, a sex worker who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym Katy Caradonna. \"It is obvious to sex workers that when we have fewer rights at work -- and any criminalization of sex work reduces our rights at work -- we are less able to protect ourselves from violence or to seek redress, and predators know we are easier targets,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nIn its analysis, the study found many forms of police violence and abuses of power, such as arbitrary arrest, extortion, physical and sexual violence and failure to provide access to justice.\n\nFear of or actual arrest led to sex workers rushing negotiations with clients or working in isolated places that increase dangers, the study explained.\n\nReporting crimes is also an issue. \"Police frequently failed to act on sex workers' reports of such crimes, or blamed and arrested sex workers themselves, meaning that offenders could operate with impunity and sex workers were reluctant to report to the police in [the] future,\" Platt said.\n\nThe study also identified that inequalities within the sex worker community were exacerbated by repressive policing, because police often target specific populations or settings, such as sex workers on the street or trans workers. This \"further marginalized these vulnerable groups,\" Platt explained.\n\nSimilarly, police crackdowns on sex work venues restrict access to health services, making it difficult for outreach programs to find sex workers.\n\nPrevious research showed that decriminalization in New Zealand resulted in sex workers being better able to refuse clients and insist on condom use. Another study showed that decriminalization has the potential to reduce discrimination as well as denials of justice, denigration and verbal abuse.\n\nThe researchers hope that there will be changes to sex work laws. In the meantime, they advocate for the need to scale up funding of specialist sex and sex worker-led services to address the diverse health care and welfare needs of people selling sex.\n\nOne of the researchers, Pippa Grenfell, assistant professor of public health sociology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, added that \"changes to sex work laws alone is not enough.\" She explained that there is a need for wider political action to tackle stigma and discrimination of sex workers by also addressing inequalities in other policies, like housing or social welfare.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere are some limitations to the study. Only a small number of papers that focused on decriminalization of sex work and the criminalization of purchase of sex were included. Similarly, few studies included data on trans female and cis-male sex workers.\n\nCatherine Murphy, senior gender adviser at Amnesty International who was not involved in the study, noted in an email that \"Criminalisation harms sex workers and this study shows that we have nearly three decades of research confirming this.\"\n\nDeborah Gold, chief executive of the UK's National AIDS Trust who was not involved in the study, said in an email that the review presents \"compelling evidence that supports the case that sex workers have been making on HIV for a generation: that repressive criminal law on sex work increases HIV risk and a host of other inequalities.

Research shows that holiday weight gain is a major contributor to total yearly weight gain, so why not resolve to maintain your weight this holiday season? Here are 10 tips that may help.\n\nNever go to a party or dinner famished\n\nStart the day with a protein-rich breakfast -- eggs, a smoothie, Greek yogurt -- as this can help control your appetite throughout the day. In addition, have a healthy snack that includes protein, fiber and/or a little healthy fat -- fruit, nuts, turkey slices, yogurt, carrots and hummus or a protein bar -- before heading out the door so you don't make a dash for the cheese tray or bread basket the minute you arrive.\n\nPediatrician Dr. Tanya Altman gives her kids nut butter and sliced apples, cheese sticks, berries and yogurt prior to a party and advises that parents focus more on what kids should be eating rather than what they can't or shouldn't. Teach them what's important to eat for their brain and body: protein, fresh fruit and veggies, dairy, and then sweet treats in moderation are fine for a holiday dessert.\n\nDownsize your plate\n\nUsing larger plates at a buffet is associated with weighing more , and larger portions can increase calorie intake significantly -- and not just in adults. A study in children found that using larger plates significantly increased both the amount they served themselves and their calorie intake.\n\nPlate color seems to make a difference, too. A recent study also found that people ate 150 fewer calories when eating off white plates versus red or black plates.\n\nSurvey the buffet before filling your plate\n\nStudies show that people who survey a buffet before filling their plate tended to be trimmer. This is probably because they took the time to decide what they were going to indulge in rather than just loading up their plates as they went.\n\nWhen filling your plate, registered dietician Ashley Koff suggests using her Better Bites & Sips Rule: When choosing what you eat or drink, it should be a seven to 10 on a scale of one to 10, where one is medicine you have to force yourself to swallow and 10 is the best bite or sip you've ever had. Anything else, pass on, as we gain weight and get unhealthy from all the three to sixes we consume because they are \"just there.\"\n\nAnd weight loss specialist Dr. Adrienne Youdim tells patients, \"Eat what you want, provided that half your plate is green. By necessity, this cuts down on heavy stuff when you gotta get greens in.\"\n\nMake time for exercise\n\nDon't skip workouts, and be active whenever possible to burn off those holiday indulgences before they start to accumulate around your midsection. Take the stairs at the mall, park farther away at the grocery store, do pushups and jumping jacks while watching TV, and plan active outings for your family.\n\nGunnar Peterson , the Los Angeles Lakers' director of strength and endurance, suggests sequencing your strength-training workout by rotating through an upper-body exercise, a lower-body exercise and a core exercise, with no rest in between, to blast calories, build (or maintain) calorie-burning muscle and save time.\n\nLimit alcohol\n\nNot only are cocktails and alcoholic beverages high in calories , they increase appetite and decrease eating restraint, so they are a triple threat when it comes to maintaining your weight over the holidays. You don't need to restrict alcohol completely, just make sure to skip the high-sugar mixed drinks (opt for club and lime as a mixer instead) and alternate each alcoholic beverage (or any high-calorie drink) with a glass of sparkling water, Youdim suggests.\n\nBe wary of bite-size offerings\n\nBite-size appetizers and desserts can quickly add up to hundreds of extra calories, so pay attention and don't mindlessly eat appetizers or load your dessert plate with bite-size desserts. Limiting variety can help limit intake, as people tend to feel less satiated with more variety.\n\nGet on the scale regularly\n\nA new study in the British Medical Journal found that people who weighed themselves at least twice a week did not gain the typical 1 to 2 pounds that the average person gains over the holidays.

Some of them were reported to be in tears.\n\nShe is understood to have promised not to call a \"snap general election\" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year's election, when she lost her majority.\n\nBut, she added: \"I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election.\"\n\nCabinet minister Amber Rudd said \"she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022\".\n\nBut Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a \"half-hearted\" reception from MPs.\n\nShe had said it was not her \"intention\" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a \"politician's word\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @GeorgeFreemanMP Powerful & moving moment in the #1922 as the PM makes clear that she has has listened, heard & respects the will of the Party that once she has delivered an orderly Brexit, she will step aside for the election of a new Leader to lead the reunification & renewal we need.

But our party will rightly not tolerate it.\n\n\"Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.\"\n\nAnd Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May.\n\nConservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg's group would \"get a kicking\" in the vote and that their \"pompous gesturing\" will be exposed.\n\nWhy are they trying to get rid of her?\n\nThey don't like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world.\n\nAnger has focused on the so-called \"backstop\" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland.\n\nMrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be \"temporary\" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether.\n\nAnd her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated.\n\nWho are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd\n\nThere are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers.\n\nFormer Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running.\n\nBut, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National.\n\nWhat does it mean for Brexit?\n\nWhatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday's summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership.\n\nShe has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to \"adopt relevant conclusions\".\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said the \"seriousness\" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning.\n\nMrs May met Germany's Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament.\n\nBut she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership.\n\nMrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum.\n\nMany of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal.

He may end up with a sentence that includes no jail time.\n\nMichael Cohen, on the other hand, initially put up a legal fight. Prosecutors say he never fully co-operated. Now the 52-year-old is facing three years in prison.\n\nAnother message from the fate of the two Trump associates is that Mr Trump's business dealings, not Russian election meddling, could present a greater legal threat to the president. According to Mr Cohen's lawyer, his client had the \"misfortune\" of being the president's personal lawyer, business partner and all-around fixer for more than a decade. When investigators began digging into his actions, they uncovered a variety of chargeable crimes.\n\nBy all accounts, Mr Trump's larger business empire is getting similar scrutiny. His long-time accountant is co-operating with investigators.\n\nThere's no telling where Mr Mueller's Russia investigation will end up, but one thing is clear - it's not the only shark circling the White House.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Cohen and Michael Flynn, who have both been caught up in investigations into Mr Trump\n\nWhat are his crimes?\n\nThe sentencing was related to two separate cases brought by the Southern District of New York and Special Counsel Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nMr Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Mr Trump.\n\nMr Trump has acknowledged the payments despite denying the affairs, and called them a private transaction unrelated to his campaign.\n\nThe special counsel reached a plea deal with Cohen on one count of lying to Congress given his co-operation with the Russia inquiry.\n\nThe president's former lawyer admitted to making false statements to Congress about a Trump property deal in Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said the special counsel probe \"is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate\", referring to the scandal that brought down Republican President Richard Nixon in 1974.\n\nCohen's other convictions for tax evasion and bank fraud charges are unrelated to the president.\n\nIn exchange for a more lenient sentence, he had offered information regarding his campaign finance violations, including paying adult film star Stormy Daniels hush money at the behest of \"the candidate\", in what is understood to be a reference to Mr Trump.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump dismissed Michael Cohen as a \"weak person\" and a liar\n\nRelations between Cohen, once considered Mr Trump's right-hand man, and the president have soured over the course of his criminal trials.\n\nMr Trump, who calls Mr Mueller's inquiry a \"witch hunt\", has repeatedly criticised his former ally since he began co-operating with investigators.\n\nHe told reporters last month that Cohen was \"weak\" and \"not a very smart person\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Cohen arrived for his sentencing with members of his family\n\nWho else has been implicated?\n\nIn other Russia investigation developments, former US national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted to lying to the FBI about his talks with the Russian ambassador, has asked for leniency.\n\nFlynn's attorneys requested he serve no prison time as he has co-operated with the special counsel's investigation from the start.\n\nLast week, the special counsel's team announced that they would not be pursuing jail time for Flynn as he provided \"substantial\" details regarding the Trump campaign team and Russian officials."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Strasbourg shooting: Gunman shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as he attacked", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46535552", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:25", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and helping a victim of the Strasbourg shooting\n\nThe Strasbourg gunman yelled \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\" in Arabic) as he opened fire on people at a Christmas market, France's anti-terror prosecutor has told reporters.\n\nR\u00e9my Heitz said two people were killed and one left brain-dead in Tuesday's attack in the eastern French city.\n\nTwelve were wounded, six seriously.\n\nThe main suspect, named by local media as Ch\u00e9rif Chekatt, is known to authorities as someone who was radicalised in prison.\n\nThe 29-year-old was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area in a taxi, Mr Heitz said.\n\nThe attacker boasted to the driver - who has spoken to police - that he had killed 10 people, and said he had been injured in a firefight with soldiers.\n\nFour people connected to the suspect had been detained overnight in Strasbourg, Mr Heitz added. Sources close to the investigation quoted by Reuters news agency said they were the suspect's mother, father and two brothers.\n\nHundreds of officers are currently involved in the search for the gunman.\n\nFrance's Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez earlier acknowledged he might no longer be in France.

As everyone was screaming he fled.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Heitz, as he fled he came into contact with four soldiers. He began firing at them and they fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm.\n\nHe managed to reach a taxi which drove him away from the scene and dropped him in the vicinity of the police station in Neudorf, the area where he lives which sits on the border between Germany and France.\n\nWhen he got out the vehicle, he fired at police officers.\n\nWhat do we know about the gunman?\n\nAccording to police - who refer to him as Ch\u00e9rif C - the gunman was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible Islamist terrorist threat.\n\nHe was the subject of a \"fiche S\", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday\n\nHe has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result.\n\nPolice were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home.\n\nMr Nu\u00f1ez said his crimes had never before been terrorism-related. But, he added, it was during one period in prison that he was indentified as having become radicalised.\n\n\"The fact he was a 'fiche S' did not pre-judge his level of dangerousness,\" Mr Nu\u00f1ez told France Inter.\n\nA search of his home revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition.\n\n'Weary and deflated'\n\nBy Damian Grammaticas, Strasbourg\n\nStrasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place.\n\nThe lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. \"We're all shaken up,\" he said.\n\nAt this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways.\n\n\"Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid,\" said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly.\n\nStrasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: \"It's shameful.\"\n\nWhat about the victims?\n\nAnupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife.\n\nThe Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports that he was in a serious condition.\n\nOne soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman.\n\nWhy is Strasbourg a target?\n\nStrasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past.\n\nNot only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack.\n\nIn 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot. Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later for their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack.\n\nHowever, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament.\n\nWere you at the Christmas market in Strasbourg at the time of the incident?

no easy task.\n\nHis first bid for the leadership, following the 2016 referendum, ended in disaster after fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the 11th hour and put himself forward instead, prompting Mr Johnson to withdraw from the race.\n\nDominic Raab\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDominic Raab, 44, had already been a long-standing Eurosceptic when he became part of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe former Brexit secretary resigned in November over what he described as \"fatal flaws\" in the prime ministers draft Brexit agreement.\n\nThe former lawyer has refused to rule out standing in a leadership contest and is said to be \"relaxed\" about a no-deal scenario, which will appeal to Brexiteer MPs.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA former protege of George Osborne, 49-year-old Sajid Javid became the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background in April, following Amber Rudd's resignation.\n\nLong thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the 2016 referendum.\n\nAn MP since 2010, he has previously served as business secretary and then culture secretary, and was part of a short-lived \"joint ticket\" leadership bid in 2016, hoping to become chancellor with Stephen Crabb as PM.\n\nMichael Gove\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMichael Gove, 51, made a dramatic comeback in June 2017 when he returned to the cabinet as environment secretary, just a year after he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle following Mrs May's leadership victory.\n\nThe former justice and education secretary came third in the last leadership contest, after withdrawing his support from fellow Leave campaigner Boris Johnson and deciding to stand himself.\n\nMr Gove has not ruled himself out to succeed Mrs May but played down speculation, saying it was \"extremely unlikely\" he would stand and tweeting on Wednesday that he was \"backing the Prime Minister 100%\".\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, 52, had always been seen as a Eurosceptic but was one of the figures supporting the David Cameron Remain position during the 2016 referendum.\n\nMr Hunt, who was the longest serving health secretary in the history of the NHS before being promoted to foreign secretary, is considered a close ally of Theresa May.\n\nHowever he has faced a number of controversies during his career, including a battle over a new contract for junior doctors in 2015.\n\nDavid Davis\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe former Brexit secretary was the first minister to quit over Mrs May's Chequers plan in July, saying he couldn't back a policy he didn't believe in.\n\nAn MP since 1987, Mr Davis, 69, first stood to be Conservative leader in 2001 and was an overwhelming favourite to replace Michael Howard in 2005 but lost out to David Cameron.\n\nHe went on to serve as shadow home secretary under Mr Cameron but dramatically resigned his seat and frontbench role in protest at plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.\n\nHe successfully fought a by-election and returned to the backbenches before unexpectedly being propelled back into frontline politics as Brexit secretary after the 2016 referendum.\n\nAmber Rudd\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAmber Rudd only returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary in November after resigning as home secretary over the Windrush scandal.\n\nShe was a leading Remain campaigner in the 2016 referendum and although being a vocal supporter of the PM's Brexit plan, she has also proposed an alternative, which would see the UK being more closely tied to the EU.\n\nThe 55-year-old MP has a slim majority of 346 in her Hastings constituency and the risk of losing her seat could hinder her chances.\n\nOthers being talked about as possible contenders\n\nBrexiteer Esther McVey, who quit the government over Mrs May's deal has already shown her ability to bounce back after losing her seat in 2015.\n\nPenny Mordaunt was a leading figure in the Leave campaign in 2016 and despite appearing reluctant to explicitly back Theresa May's Brexit plan, she has not resigned from her cabinet role as international development secretary.\n\nLiz Truss, currently second-in-command at the Treasury, has been building up her profile with some memorable party conference appearances.\n\nCommons leader Andrea Leadsom, a Brexiteer who challenged Mrs May in 2016 before withdrawing, might fancy another go\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox was a big hit at this year's Tory conference, with a theatrical speech, prompting talk of him as a future leader.\n\nPriti Patel, a Brexiteer who quit the government over private trips to Israel, has a strong base of support which is reflected in the betting.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for Mrs May to go, has previously denied having leadership ambitions.

but only by a maximum of just over \u00a320 a year, according to economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute.\n\nMr Mackay also said everyone earning under about \u00a3124,000 in Scotland would pay less tax than they did last year.\n\nImage caption Source: Fraser of Allander Institute\n\nMr Mackay said his budget \"prepares our economy for the opportunity of the future, enables the transformation of essential public services, and builds a more inclusive and just society\".\n\nHis pledges included:\n\nA real-terms increase in the education budget, including \u00a3180m to close the attainment gap\n\nA real-terms boost of \u00a3500m for the health budget and extra investment in mental health\n\nExtra revenue and capital funding for local government\n\n\u00a35bn of infrastructure investment over the coming year, including \u00a31.7bn for transport\n\nThe finance secretary warned that he \"may be required to revisit the priorities in this budget\" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, saying that \"significant resources\" had already been diverted to preparing for Brexit.\n\nOn income tax, Mr Mackay opted to raise the threshold where the lowest rates kick in by the rate of inflation, and froze the point at which people start paying the higher rate at \u00a343,430.\n\nThis means almost all Scots will pay no more tax next year than in the current financial year.\n\nBut with Chancellor Philip Hammond announcing in October that the higher rate threshold in the rest of the UK will rise to \u00a350,000, it means the gap between what higher earners pay in tax north and south of the border will grow.\n\nMr Mackay insisted that \"now is not the time to cut tax for the highest earners at the expense of our public services\".\n\nHe said freezing the higher rate threshold - paid by the top 15% of taxpayers in Scotland - was forecast to deliver an extra \u00a368m for public services.\n\nImage caption Trade unionists rallied outside Holyrood ahead of the budget\n\nWednesday's announcement is the first step in the budget process, which will see MSPs vote on the budget bill for the first time at the end of January.\n\nMr Mackay needs to win the backing of at least one opposition party to get his plans through parliament, but little progress has been made in negotiations so far.\n\nOpposition party members raised a series of concerns with Mr Mackay following his announcement.\n\nFor the Conservatives, Murdo Fraser said there was \"no requirement for tax rises\" when extra money was being sent to Holyrood from Westminster in light of spending increases south of the border.\n\nLabour's James Kelly said the budget was \"timid\" and had failed to support public services which are at \"breaking point\".\n\nGreen co-convener Patrick Harvie challenged Mr Mackay over local government finance reform, while Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to distance themselves from plans for a second independence referendum."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "Royal Cornwall Hospital on Opel 4 highest alert for 134 days", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46361699", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:00:47", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Katie Flack Image caption Katie Flack had been prepped for surgery and wearing a hospital gown when her hysterectomy was cancelled the second time\n\nA woman's life was turned \"upside-down\" when major surgery was cancelled four times by a hospital suffering from extreme pressures.\n\nKatie Flack had already been prepared for surgery when the Royal Cornwall Hospital cancelled her hysterectomy.\n\nThe hospital declared the highest alert -

maltreatment, neglect, sexual victimisation, family violence, peer/sibling violence, cyber-victimisation, and crime - through interviews with participants when they were 18 years old.\n\nWhat did the study find?\n\nThe study found that more than one-third of adolescents had experienced at least one type of severe victimisation between the ages of 12 and 18 and 7% had experienced three or more severe types of victimisation.\n\nAlmost a fifth (18.9%) had had some form of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours.\n\nThe researchers found that teenagers who were victims were much more likely than their non-victimised peers to have these sorts of thoughts.\n\nFor each additional victimisation type experienced, the risk of contemplating suicide and of self-harming doubled, and the risk of attempting suicide tripled, they found.\n\nHalf of adolescents exposed to three or more types of victimisation had experienced suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and a quarter had attempted suicide.\n\nThe study acknowledges that \"pre-existing vulnerabilities\" are a major factor in these thoughts and behaviours.\n\nBut, after making adjustments for family and individual vulnerabilities, victimised teens still showed an increase in suicidal thoughts (though not suicide attempts) and self-harming.\n\nWhat does the research call for?\n\nThe study says preventing adolescents from becoming victims - for example through school-based anti-bullying schemes, family support programmes and community safety initiatives - could help reduce the likelihood of them having suicidal thoughts or self-harming.\n\nBut it also concludes that effective interventions to prevent premature death in victimised adolescents should also address pre-existing vulnerabilities.\n\nLead author Jessie Baldwin from King's College London told the BBC: \"Our findings showed that victimisation in adolescence is an important risk factor for suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Therefore, adolescents known to have experienced maltreatment, bullying, cyber-victimisation, and other forms of victimisation should be supported to prevent them from self-harming or taking their own lives.\n\n\"Because victimised adolescents' elevated risk of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours was in part due to their pre-existing vulnerabilities, clinicians treating victimised adolescents should address these vulnerabilities.\n\n\"More broadly, professionals working with young people should appreciate that victimised adolescents have a range of vulnerabilities to poor mental health and self-harm.\"\n\nThe research paper -

This is a measurement that involves sensing the difference in height between the top of the floating floes and the surface of the ocean.\n\nThe offset - known as the freeboard - allows researchers to calculate that part of the ice submerged below water. But it requires the satellite to find the cracks in floes where the measurement can be made - and this has just become a whole lot easier thanks to the new laser's horizontal footprint of about 25-30m.\n\n\"Eighty percent of the cracks are less than 50m across, so the resolution of IceSat is very important,\" said Ron Kwok from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\nHeights are calculated from just 150 photons, or particles, of reflected light, but even from just this small number, IceSat-2 is able to produce an elevation number to an accuracy of a little over 2cm.

Some herds have shrunk by more than 90% - \"such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight\", this Arctic Report Card stated.\n\nOther stories from the AGU meeting you might like:\n\nWhy is a warmer Arctic worse for reindeer?\n\nThere are multiple reasons.\n\nProf Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating.\n\n\"We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation.\"\n\nImage copyright NOAA Image caption The Arctic is greening, but that is not good news for reindeer\n\nThe lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. \"Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,\" he told BBC News.\n\nAnother very big issue is the number of insects. \"Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,\" said Prof Epstein. \"It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou.\n\n\"If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects.\"\n\nRain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food.\n\nCan anything be done?\n\nAt the global scale, this comes down to reducing carbon emissions and limiting temperature increase.\n\nImage copyright NOAA Image caption The Arctic Report Card revealed that the region was entering uncharted territory due to climate change\n\nBut scientists say we have opened the door on the \"world's freezer\" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate.\n\nThe report, compiled by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\"In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,\" she said. \"And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nSome other key points from the report included:\n\nPlastic pollution: tiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris.\n\ntiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris.

Preliminary results of various investigations are being reported here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union - the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists.\n\nThe quake occurred on what is called a strike-slip fault, where the ground on one side of a rupture moves horizontally past the ground on the other side. It is not a configuration normally associated with very large tsunamis.\n\nNevertheless, this is what happened in the early evening of 28 September, around prayer time.\n\nTwo main surges of water were observed, the second being the biggest and pushing up to 400m inland.\n\nUdrekh Al Hanif, from the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, told the meeting that the generation source of the tsunami had to be very close to the city because of the short interval between the onset of the quake and the arrival of the high water - less than three minutes.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Scientists have sought answers on the bay floor\n\nHe and colleagues have sought answers in a depth (bathymetric) map of the long, narrow inlet that leads to Palu at its head. The team is still working through the results, but the data indicates the seafloor in much of the bay dropped down in the quake.\n\nThis, combined with a sharp movement of the crust northwards, could certainly have produced a tsunami, the Indonesian scientist said.\n\n\"When we overlap the bathymetric data from before and after, we can see that almost all of the area of the seafloor inside the bay subsides. And from this data, we can also observe [the movement] to the north. So, actually, we have a vertical and a horizontal displacement,\" Udrekh Al Hanif told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright BPPT Image caption Looking south down the bay towards Palu: The seafloor dropped in response to the quake\n\nWhether this behaviour was enough on its own to explain the tsunami's size is still open to question.\n\nThere is evidence of several underwater landslides in the data. These, too, could have been a factor.\n\nAnother possibility is an upwards thrust of the seabed in a zone some distance from Palu where the strike-slip fault splits into diverging tracks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down\n\nMovement on both tracks at the same time might have compressed the crust in between.\n\n\"This was a very unusual event but the tectonics tell us it could happen again,\" said Finn L\u00f8vholt from the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute.\n\n\"Indeed, this is not the first time an event has happened in Palu. It's probably the third or fourth event that has caused many fatalities. We had events in the 1960s and 1920s.\"\n\nImage copyright Georgia Institute of Technology Image caption Damage has been scanned with lidar to better understand the movement of the water\n\nAnd this history is evidenced in the local culture where there are specific words to describe features of a tsunami and a quake. In the September event, Palu witnessed a lot of liquefaction, where the structure of soils in the city was seen to collapse, to become fluidised and flow even on very low gradients.\n\nHouses were consumed in the mud. Local people call this \"Nalodo\", which means something like \"buried in black\".\n\nHermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said Palu demonstrated the challenge confronting the local population. \"This tsunami arrived very fast, within minutes,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That basically leaves no time for warnings. That's very different from Japan (in 2011) where there was an eternity of time - more than 30 minutes everywhere until the first person was killed by the tsunami. That's the challenge for these local tsunamis: people have to self-evacuate.\"\n\nWidjo Kongko, also from the BPPT, spoke of some complacency following an emergency drill conducted in Palu in 2012. \"It said go to high ground within 5-10 minutes.

We need no distractions from seeking the best outcome with our neighbours, friends and partners in the EU,\" Cameron said on Twitter.\n\nAs prime minister, Cameron initiated the UK's 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, which saw 52 percent of Britons opt to quit the bloc.\n\nHaving argued in favour of the UK remaining in the EU, he swiftly resigned in the wake of the leave result.\n\nBetting odds indicate May will win no-confidence vote\n\nThe betting odds have shifted sharply towards British Prime Minister Theresa May surviving a no-confidence vote on Wednesday after a leadership contest was called by legislators unhappy with her handling of Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nThe shift comes after a flurry of bets that she will win the vote and more than 158 Conservative Party MPs publicly backed the prime minister.\n\nThe likelihood that May will the win the vote has risen to 89 percent, according to bookmakers William Hill, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes.\n\nEarlier in the day, William Hill said there was a 60 percent chance she will survive and Paddy Power gave odds of 71 percent.\n\n\"The money suggests that Theresa May will survive today's vote,\" said Rupert Adams, a William Hill spokesman. \"But things remain bleak and we fully expect her to leave office in 2019.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to fight for her political future with \"everything I've got\" as the UK's bid to depart the European Union descends into a deepening political crisis.\n\nMembers of May's ruling Conservative Party reached the threshold of 48 demands needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership.\n\nIf May loses, her successor would be chosen from existing Conservative MPs and would automatically become prime minister.\n\n\n\nBut if she wins, she will be immune to further challenges for a year. The result is due around 21:00 GMT.\n\nEmbattled PM issues Brexit warning to party members\n\nIn a stark warning to Brexit-supporting opponents who instigated the challenge, May said if they toppled her then the EU exit would be delayed, perhaps even stopped.\n\nA new leader would not have time to renegotiate a deal with the EU and secure parliamentary approval by the end of March, meaning the Article 50 withdrawal notice would have to be extended or rescinded, she said.\n\n\"A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,\" she said.\n\n\"Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country.\"\n\nAccording to the rules, May could be toppled if a simple majority of Conservative MPs vote against her. At least 153 of her 315 Conservative MPs had expressed public support for her by 12:55 GMT.\n\nGerman government approves Brexit legislation\n\nGermany's cabinet has approved legislation to protect British residents' rights in the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit and to make the country a more attractive location for banks seeking to relocate.\n\nBrexit jargon: From backstop to no deal, 17 key terms explained\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said ministers have approved a bill safeguarding the German health insurance, unemployment insurance and pension status of British citizens living in Germany and German citizens living in Britain at the time of Brexit.\n\nAnother German bill foresees loosening the requirement for banks to justify why they're ending a contract with a highly paid employee deemed to be a \"bearer of risk,\" such as heads of department or high-volume traders.\n\nGermany has much more restrictive rules on dismissing workers than Britain, which is seen as a disincentive for Britain-based banks to shift operations to Frankfurt.\n\nBritish currency jumps as BBC forecasts May to win vote\n\nThe British pound jumped on Wednesday after the BBC reported that a majority of Conservative Party MPs were set to back Prime Minister May in a no-confidence vote.\n\nAt about 13:30 GMT, the pound advanced to $1.2579, having earlier hit a fresh 20-month low at $1.2478. The pound recovered to 90.18 pence versus the euro.\n\nAccording to the BBC, May was set to win the vote with at least 158 Conservative MPs - more than 50 percent of those eligible - having pledged their support for the embattled premier."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "UN's Guterres: No deal in Poland climate talks will be 'suicidal'", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/guterres-deal-poland-climate-talks-suicidal-181212173258617.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Failure by countries to agree on rules to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement on global warming would be \"suicidal\", the United Nations chief said on Wednesday.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told delegates from more than 130 countries meeting in the city of Katowice, Poland, they had less than three days to find the political will to reach the difficult compromises, sacrifices and common ground needed for a deal.\n\nThe two-week talks are tasked with breathing life into the Paris accord, which vows to cap global warming at \"well under\" 2 degrees Celsius and funnel hundreds of billions of dollars to poor countries already feeling the sting of deadly storms, heatwaves and drought made worse by climate change.\n\n\"Key political issues\" deadlocking UN climate talks \"remain unresolved\", said Guterres.\n\n\"Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy,\" he said.\n\n\"To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change.

The two terms will run concurrently.\n\nJudge Pauley said Cohen's cooperation with prosecutors \"does not wipe the slate clean\" of his crimes. He also said that Cohen \"appears to have lost his moral compass\" and that lawyer \"should have known better\".\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in August to charges by federal prosecutors in New York that, just before the election, he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 and helped arrange a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal so the women would keep quiet about their past relationships with President Donald Trump, who is married. Trump denies having the affairs.\n\nCohen also admitted to unrelated charges of tax evasion and making false statements to banks.\n\nProsecutors say the hush money payments violated campaign finance laws and they concurred with Cohen\u2019s assertion that the payments were directed by Trump, implicating Trump in a possible campaign finance law violation.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Trump denied the payments were campaign contributions. \u201cIf it were, it\u2019s only civil, and even if it\u2019s only civil, there was no violation based on what we did,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal law requires that the contribution of \u201canything of value\u201d to a campaign must be disclosed and that an individual donation cannot exceed $2,700.\n\n181207214905016\n\nCohen also pleaded guilty to a separate charge of lying to Congress brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.\n\nThe sentencing caps the stunning about-face of a lawyer who once said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump but has now directly implicated the president in criminal conduct.\n\nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia and has accused Mueller\u2019s team of pressuring his former aides to lie about him, his campaign and his business dealings. Russia has denied US allegations of interfering in the election to help Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has argued the hush payments cannot be considered campaign finance violations because they were made to protect Trump\u2019s reputation and would have been made even if he had not been a presidential candidate.\n\n'Substantial term'\n\nAlthough Cohen asked in a November 30 court filing to be given no prison time based on his assistance in the investigation, prosecutors asked on Friday for Cohen to be given a \u201csubstantial term of imprisonment\u201d for his crimes, with only a \u201cmodest\u201d reduction to the roughly four to five-year term they say he faces under sentencing guidelines.\n\nThey said Cohen declined to sign a formal cooperation agreement, which would have required him to be fully debriefed about his entire criminal history and his knowledge of others\u2019 crimes. His refusal to cooperate fully, they said, limited his credibility as a witness.\n\n181208174602506\n\nIn his guilty plea to Mueller\u2019s charge, Cohen admitted he lied to Congress about the timeline for discussions of plans for real estate businessman Trump\u2019s skyscraper in Moscow.\n\nHe said in written testimony to two committees that the talks ended in January 2016, before the first contests to select the Republican presidential candidate, when they actually continued until June 2016, after Trump clinched the Republican nomination.\n\nMueller\u2019s sentencing recommendation was more generous, saying Cohen had provided valuable information about contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago.

When she has severe episodes, known as crises, her grades drop.\n\nSickle cell anemia affects red blood cells, the cells that carry oxygen throughout the body.\n\nCells that are normally round become hard and look like the C-shaped farm tool called a sickle. They get stuck in blood vessels, causing pain. The cells also die early, causing a constant shortage of red blood cells.\n\nShattered dreams\n\n\n\nTwenty-four-year old Blaise Fora said his hopes of getting married were shattered because he is a sickle cell patient.\n\nHe said he has decided to remain single because when he fell in love once and was preparing to get married, his fiancee's family was vehemently opposed. They did not want him to - in their words - contaminate their daughter with sickle cell.\n\nFora said the family was concerned that the couple's children might be born with the disease. Those types of concerns are shared by many people, and aid agencies are responding by suggesting couples that are about to marry to get genetic tests done first.\n\nHaminatu Hadza Karim from Chad, is among those leading the largely informal campaign, organized by associations of sickle cell patients.\n\nShe says many of the women she works with have been thrown out by their husbands for delivering babies with sickle cell. She says she invites other women dealing with these prejudices to join them so they can fight for their rights and eradicate the disease.\n\nGenetic counseling\n\n\n\nSome people have the sickle cell trait without having the disease. To pass on the disease to a baby, both parents must be carriers.\n\nDr. Oumar Zacki, who takes care of sickle cell patients in Garoua, says a lack of genetic counseling means many people are without crucial knowledge.\n\nHe says the population of Central and West Africa move about with no visible symptoms but who carry sickle cell genes, passed from generation to generation in a pattern of inheritance.\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that in Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Ghana and Nigeria, between 20 and 30 percent of the population carries the sickle cell trait. In Uganda, more than 40 percent carry the trait."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Pakistan Hosts Regional Meeting on Countering Afghan Opiates", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-regional-meeting-on-countering-afghan-opiates/4697559.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran have pledged to increase cooperation and information-sharing for effectively combating the trafficking of Afghan opiates.\n\nWar-shattered Afghanistan remains the world\u2019s largest producer of opium, though the U.N.

Alaskan scientists described to The Associated Press on Tuesday never-before-seen melting and odd winter problems, including permafrost that never refroze this past winter and wildlife die-offs.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday released its annual Arctic report card, detailing the second warmest year on record in the Arctic and problems, including record low winter sea ice in parts of the region, increased toxic algal blooms, which are normally a warm water phenomenon, and weather changes in the rest of the country attributable to what's happening in the far North.\n\n\"The Arctic is experiencing the most unprecedented transition in human history,\" report lead author Emily Osborne, chief of Arctic research for NOAA, said Tuesday.\n\n'A new Arctic'\n\nWhat's happening is a big deal, said University of Colorado environmental science program director Waleed Abdalati, NASA's former chief scientist who was not part of the NOAA report.\n\n\"It's a new Arctic. We've gone from white to blue,\" said Abdalati, adding that he normally wouldn't use the word \"scary\" but it applies.\n\nAnd that means other problems.\n\n\"Continued warming of the Arctic atmosphere and ocean are driving broad change in the environmental system in predicted, and, also, unexpected ways,\" the NOAA report said.\n\nOne of the most noticeable problems was a record low sea ice in winter in the Bering Sea in 2017 and 2018, scientists said.\n\nIn February the Bering Sea \"lost an area of ice the area of Idaho,\" said Dartmouth College engineering professor Donald Perovich, a report card co-author.\n\nThis is a problem because the oldest and thickest sea ice is down 95 percent from 30 years ago. In 1985, about one-sixth of Arctic sea ice was thick multi-year ice, now it is maybe one-hundredth, Perovich said.\n\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks marine mammal biologist Gay Sheffield not only studies the record low ice, but she lives it daily in Nome, far north on the Bering Sea.\n\n\"I left Nome and we had open water in December,\" Sheffield said at the American Geophysical Union conference in Washington. \"It's very much impacting us.\"\n\n\"Having this area ice free is having this massive environmental change,\" Sheffield said, adding there's been a \"multi-species die off\" of ocean life. She said that includes the first spring mass die off of seals along the Bering Strait.\n\nShrinking permafrost\n\nOrnithologist George Divoky, who has been studying the black guillemots of Cooper Island for 45 years, noticed something different this year. In the past, 225 nesting pairs of the seabirds would arrive at his island. This past winter it was down to 85 pairs, but only 50 laid eggs and only 25 had successful hatches. He blamed the lack of winter sea ice.\n\n\"It looked like a ghost town,\" Divoky said.\n\nWith overall melting, especially in the summer, herds of caribou and wild reindeer have dropped about 55 percent \u2014 from 4.7 million to 2.1 million animals \u2014 because of the warming and the flies and parasites it brings, said report card co-author Howard Epstein of the University of Virginia.\n\nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Vladimir Romanovsky said he was alarmed by what happened to the permafrost \u2014 ground that stays frozen years on end. This past year, Romanovsky found 25 spots that used to freeze in January, then February, but never froze this year.\n\nBecause of warming, the Arctic is \"seeing concentrations of algal toxins moving northward\" \u2014 infecting birds, mammals and shellfish to become a public health and economic problem, said report card co-author Karen Frey.\n\nAnd the warmer Arctic and melting sea ice has been connected to shifts in the jet stream that have brought extreme winter storms in the East in the past year, Osborne said.\n\nBut it's not just the Arctic. NASA's newest space-based radar, Icesat 2, in its first couple of months has already found that the Dotson ice shelf in Antarctica has lost more than 390 feet (120 meters) in thickness since 2003, said radar scientist Ben Smith of the University of Washington.\n\nAnother study released Monday by NASA found unusual melting in parts of East Antarctica, which scientists had generally thought was stable.\n\nFour glaciers at Vincennes Bay lost nine feet of ice thickness since 2008, said NASA scientists Catherine Walker and Alex Gardner.\n\nLoss of ice sheets in Antarctica could lead to massive rise in sea level.\n\n\"We're starting to see change that's related to the ocean,\" Gardner said. \"Believe it or not this is the first time we're seeing it in this place.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Sports, Deaths Among 2018's Top Google Searches", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/sports-deaths-among-2018-s-top-google-searches-/4697669.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "Sports, disaster and death were among the top searches on Google last year.\n\n\n\nEach December, the technology company releases it's top trending searches of the year.

And today, as Theresa May faces an existential threat to her premiership, a similar flaw is evident in the Tory party\u2019s leadership rules. MPs can get rid of May without having a replacement lined up. They can have their moment of \u2018we\u2019re free!\u2019 cartharsis, but once the exhilarating whiff of liberation has faded, the realisation dawns that their leap of faith is a leap into the unknown. The instability and uncertainty of alternative options has been the threat that has kept May in power since her disastrous snap election. Yet for many of her MPs, May\u2019s exit (can we call it Mexit?) is worth the risk.\n\nAfter Tory backbenchers decided to \u2018take back control\u2019 of their party leadership, they will know that any replacement PM would face the exact same Parliamentary arithmetic and the exact same deadlock over Brexit. That arithmetic can only be changed by a general election, an election that many Tory MPs in marginal seats simply can\u2019t countenance because of the real threat of Jeremy Corbyn running yet another poll-defying election campaign that could make him Prime Minister.\n\nThe Christmas chaos that this contest could provoke is obvious. It\u2019s possible that under the newly centralised party membership system, a ballot could be held by email, but many members would want a postal vote. Add in hustings around the country, and it could be that it is the New Year before a contest could be realistically staged, May\u2019s allies will war.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss details of the large and ongoing investigation.\n\nSenior Interior Ministry official Laurent Nunez said the man had been radicalized in prison and had been monitored by French intelligence services since his release from jail in late 2015, because of his suspected religious extremism.\n\nNunez, secretary of state for the Interior Ministry, said on France-Inter radio that police sought to arrest the man on Tuesday morning, hours before the shooting, in relation to an attempted murder. He was not at home but five other people were detained, authorities said.\n\nThe government raised the security alert level and sent police reinforcements to Strasbourg, where more than 350 security forces were involved in the massive manhunt. Police officials said he was wounded in a gunfight with soldiers after the Tuesday night attack but escaped, and a top official said he might have fled to neighboring Germany.\n\nChristian Hartmann / Reuters Some 350 security forces and two helicopters were searching for the assailant.\n\nA terrorism investigation was opened, but the motive of the attack is unclear. Nunez said eight of the injured are in serious condition, and the city mayor said some had head wounds.\n\nWitnesses described shots and screams after the gunman opened fire around the Christmas market Tuesday evening in a city that\u2019s home to the European Parliament and considers itself a capital of Europe \u2014 and promotes itself as the \u201ccapital of Christmas.\u201d For several hours swaths of the city were under lockdown.\n\nThe suspected attacker also had a criminal record in Germany. He was convicted of robbery in Germany in 2016 and sentenced to two years and three months in prison for breaking into a dental practice and a pharmacy in two German towns.\n\nThe 2016 verdict from a district court in the southern German city of Singen, obtained by The Associated Press, also said he was sentenced to prison in France in 2008 and in Basel, Switzerland in 2013 for various robberies. News agency dpa reported that he was deported to France in 2017.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Witnesses described hearing gunshots, screams and shouts of police officers.\n\nAccording to that verdict, the suspected attacker grew up with six siblings in Strasbourg, worked for local authorities after leaving school and had been unemployed since 2011. He said that he had been traveling a lot and had already spent four years of his life in prison. The German robberies took place in Mainz, near Frankfurt, in 2012 and in Engen, near the Swiss border, in 2016.\n\nThe attack is a new blow to France, which saw a wave of Islamic extremist killings in 2015 and 2016. It came amid a month of protests against President Emmanuel Macron that have blocked roads around the country, led to rioting in the capital and put heavy strain on police.\n\nWhile authorities urged people in the area to stay inside after Tuesday\u2019s attack, Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries told BFM television Wednesday that \u201clife must go on\u201d so that the city doesn\u2019t cede to a \u201cterrorist who is trying to disrupt our way of life.\u201d\n\nThe assailant got inside a security zone around the venue and opened fire from there, Mayor Roland Ries said on BFM television.\n\nChristian Hartmann / Reuters Authorities had urged the public to remain indoors at the height of the drama.\n\nPolice were out in force in Strasbourg, a city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Paris on France\u2019s border with Germany, on Wednesday morning. The Christmas market, a holiday tradition there, was closed. The market was the target of an al-Qaida-linked plot at the turn of the millennium.\n\nMany of Europe\u2019s deadliest terror attacks in recent years have taken place in France. In response to Tuesday\u2019s shooting, the government decided to take the country\u2019s attack risk up a level on the official threat index and to send security reinforcements to Strasbourg, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said in Strasbourg.\n\nSome 350 officers and two helicopters were searching for the assailant after Tuesday\u2019s drama, which involved shooting in multiple neighborhoods of Strasbourg, authorities said. The assailant confronted law enforcement officers twice, exchanging fire, while he \u201csowed terror,\u201d Castaner said.\n\nSEBASTIEN BOZON via Getty Images France has been hit in recent years with high-profile extremist attacks.\n\nThe shooter was shot and wounded by soldiers guarding the Christmas market, according to Stephane Morisse of police union FGP Police.\n\n\u201cI heard two or three shots at around 7:55 p.m., then I heard screams. I got close to the window. I saw people running. After that I closed the shutters. Then I heard more shots, closer this time,\u201d said Yoann Bazard, 27, who lives in central Strasbourg.\n\n\u201cI thought maybe it\u2019s firecrackers,\u201d he said, speaking by phone. \u201cAnd then, as it got close, it was really shocking.

Copper Crow is the first distillery owned by Native Americans.\n\nBy Matt Vasilogambros\n\nRED CLIFF, Wis. \u2014 One of the last relics of federal prohibition may soon come to an end, after Congress two weeks ago voted to lift a 184-year-old ban that prohibited distilleries on tribal lands.\n\nOnce signed into law, Native Americans across the country can finally tap into the budding industry of craft spirits on their own lands, no longer stifled by a policy from a time when federal authorities forcibly removed tribes from their homelands and enacted discriminatory statutes aimed at choking off Native wealth.\n\nThe future of Native American distilling already has begun in northern Wisconsin, along the birch-lined shores of Lake Superior, where one family has found a way to bring jobs to a reservation \u2014 and perhaps, move past the stereotype of the \u201cdrunken Indian\u201d that has long haunted its people.\n\nHere on the heavily forested, sparsely populated reservation of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, down the snow-covered road from the lakefront casino, sits Copper Crow, the first Native American-owned distillery in the United States.\n\nIn a well-lit room with high ceilings and concrete floors, owner Curt Basina sticks a finger into the stream of clear liquid that flows from a 10-tiered column still, tasting the whey-based vodka he is developing. The vodka tastes faintly sweet with only a small bite.\n\n\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he says, a slight grin under his graying handlebar mustache.\n\nThe air in the distillery is heavy with the sour smell of the wheat-based mash fermenting in plastic tubs at the other end of the room. Later in the day, Basina will transfer the mash into a copper still with carbon-filtered water to begin the heating process. Two crow feathers are pinched between its pipes to honor the distillery\u2019s name and the tribal traditions it represents.\n\n\u201cThe crow helps you find your purpose in life,\u201d Basina said later, taking a sip of homebrewed medicinal tea made from foraged chaga mushrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s very meaningful in the tribal culture.\u201d\n\nBasina, a former Wisconsin highway patrolman of 17 years, is one of 7,300 members of a tribe who lived on the south shores of the Great Lake their ancestors called Gichigami well before French fur trappers arrived to trade with them in the 17th century and the federal government ceded a reservation to the tribe in 1854.\n\nBasina was aware of the federal ban when his family began to plan out the distillery, but soon learned they were exempt from the archaic statute. The distillery is within the reservation, but it\u2019s not on tribal land \u2014 it\u2019s on private land his family owns. They got the green light from the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to start selling vodka last April.\n\nHis distillery illustrates how Native entrepreneurs are trying to bring small businesses to reservations, harnessing burgeoning consumer trends. The brewery, winery and distillery industries were the second-fastest-growing for manufacturing in 2017, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nIn 1834, when Congress banned distilleries in Indian Country, legislators said it was to \u201cpreserve peace on the frontier.\u201d Nearly two centuries later, Basina is glad to see the language go.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can get away with saying something like that today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Myth of the \u2018Drunken Indian\u2019\n\nSince the founding of this country, the federal government has taken a paternalistic approach to Native American consumption of alcohol, said Peter Mancall, a professor of history at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe bitter irony, he said, is that it was colonial Europeans who introduced alcohol to native populations for economic and religious purposes, and Americans who continued to use it as a trading tool in buying furs and making treaties.\n\nThe same law that banned distilleries on tribal lands in 1834 also banned the sale of alcohol to Native Americans on reservations. And there were many more federal laws like it to enforce Native prohibition.\n\nAs a 1996 article in the Arizona State Law Journal said, \u201cIneffective federal and racist state legislation cemented the stigma of the \u2018drunken Indian\u2019 as a race helpless to control itself against alcohol.\u201d\n\nBut the stereotype survived and still affects the way many people, including some Native Americans, view alcohol\u2019s place on reservations.\n\nTribal members of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, when asked in a 2014 survey what would have a negative impact on their economic future, most often said it would be alcohol, bars and liquor stores.\n\nIt\u2019s a stereotype of which Linda Basina, Curt Basina\u2019s wife of 37 years, was well aware before the couple began the Copper Crow Distillery on the Red Cliff Reservation.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t immune to it,\u201d said Basina, a special education teacher\u2019s aide. \u201cWe tried to be sensitive to it. Yes, we are Native Americans, but we can also be successful at this business and give back to the community.\u201d\n\nThere was some initial pushback against the prospect of a distillery on the reservation, said Nathan Gordon, the tribal vice chairman, adding that people thought it was insensitive to the community\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThere are some individual members that don\u2019t want nothing like that here,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the tribal council also had to weigh the fact that the tribe allows alcohol to be sold at its casino and convenience stores, and that a distillery would bring jobs and new patrons to the reservation, Gordon said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see a business,\u201d said Gordon, sitting in his office adorned with a ceremonial headdress, traditional art and a wood-carved bald eagle. \u201cCurt is an entrepreneur, he has a dream, and he\u2019s moving things forward.\u201d\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Linda and Curt Basina opened the Copper Crow Distillery on the Red Cliff Reservation in Wisconsin this year, serving vodka and bringing new jobs to the area.\n\nCopper Crow, which employs eight people, markets its liquor primarily to people who don\u2019t live on the reservation, bringing needed tourism dollars to the reservation, whose residents largely work for the tribe and in commercial fishing.\n\nLike many reservations across the country, Red Cliff is struggling. According to its 2018 census, the reservation has an 18 percent unemployment rate and a $29,000 median household income, which is roughly half the state and national averages. Nearly a fifth of the reservation\u2019s 1,300 residents live in mobile homes.\n\nGordon now encourages the other 10 tribes throughout the state to sell Copper Crow vodka in their casinos. There\u2019s no word, he said, on whether other tribes are considering their own distilleries now.\n\n\u2018Small Distilling Is Booming\u2019\n\nKeeping distilleries away from reservations meant years of keeping profits away, said Kevin Kosar, the vice president of policy at the R Street Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based free-enterprise think tank that has helped raise awareness of the ban in the past year.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant amount of money on the line,\u201d Kosar said. \u201cSmall distilling is booming in this country, following the same pattern we saw with craft beer and, before that, craft wine.\u201d\n\nThis growing sector of the economy is now responsible for around 20,000 jobs at more than 1,500 distilleries nationwide, according to the American Craft Spirits Association. Around a dozen states across the country have even enacted laws to encourage craft distilleries, as Stateline has reported.\n\nSeeing that growth, the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation in southwest Washington earlier this year began planning a brewpub restaurant that featured both a brewery and a distillery, which it would own and operate. But during the permit process, they learned from the Bureau of Indian Affairs that federal law prevented them from moving forward with the distillery.\n\nCongress threw out most federal restrictions on Native drinking in 1953, acknowledging the original 19th century statutes were \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d The federal government has largely left liquor regulation to the states, with a few glaring exceptions such as Prohibition.\n\nBut while the 1953 law eased restrictions for future breweries on a reservation, the ban on distilling remained on the books.\n\nNot willing to give up, Chehalis tribal leaders in March reached out to U.S. Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler, a Washington Republican, who soon drafted legislation to end the ban. It passed the House in September, followed by the Senate two months later. It now sits on President Donald Trump\u2019s desk, awaiting his signature.\n\nNow the tribe is moving ahead with its plans.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Copper Crow Distillery sits nestled among evergreens, less than a mile from the shores of Lake Superior. This is the first Native American-owned distillery in the country.\n\nThe project could create a hundred construction jobs over the next year, and around 40 service jobs once the restaurant, brewery and distillery are up and running, tribal spokesman Jeff Warnke said. It\u2019s a needed economic development boost in an area that, Warnke said, has been historically depressed.\n\nThe White House has been supportive of the bill, he said, adding that he expects the president to sign it into law.\n\n\u201cThrough tribal sovereignty and self-determination, tribes can now open a distillery and provide jobs for their tribal members,\u201d Warnke said. \u201cThese economic developments help provide policing, health care, roads and Head Start programs for their children.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, the Penobscot Indian Nation also is considering its own distilling operation. The tribe, however, is still trudging through the permit and logistical processes, said Eric Nicolar of Penobscot Indian Nation Enterprises, the tribe\u2019s business arm.\n\nThe booming demand for local artisanal goods will encourage more tribes to join the industry, R Street\u2019s Kosar said, and support economic development that reservations surely need.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts Liz Bodin, one of the Basinas\u2019 daughters, far right, and Angela Botka, second from right, serve cocktails in downtown Bayfield, Wisconsin, to local shoppers.\n\n\u2018This Is Where Our Roots Are\u2019"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Thomas Markle Slams Prince Harry In Salacious New Interview", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-markle-prince-harry-meghan-markle_us_5c111a07e4b084b082febfdf", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "Thomas Markle is trying to win back the attention and affection of his daughter Meghan Markle with a profanity-laced interview pointing out Prince Harry\u2019s past mistakes and revealing she gave away weed as a wedding favor at her first nuptials to director Trevor Engelson.\n\nIn an extensive interview with The Mail on Sunday published over the weekend, Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, talked about how he\u2019s tried to reach his daughter, whom he reportedly hasn\u2019t spoken to since the day after her royal wedding with Harry in May.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone.

A new report drilled down to determine the specific drug \u2015 not just the class of drugs \u2015 involved in overdose deaths from 2011 to 2016.\n\nA new report analyzing the drugs involved in fatal overdoses once again emphasized fentanyl\u2019s role in the United States\u2019 opioid crisis and highlighted a point frequently made by public health experts: Most people who fatally overdose have more than one drug in their system.\n\nIn 2016, about 70 percent of fatal overdoses involving fentanyl or heroin involved another drug as well, and roughly 74 percent of fatal overdoses involving cocaine also involved one or more other drugs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a tendency to think of these drugs in isolation. It\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Dr. Holly Hedegaard, lead author of the report and injury epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nMore than 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMost reports on drug overdose deaths only determine what class of drugs were involved. The new report, published Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics, analyzed the text of death certificates and compared it with National Vital Statistics System data, drilling down to determine the specific drug \u2015 not just the class of drugs \u2015 involved in overdose deaths from 2011 to 2016.\n\nWhat researchers found mirrored news reports in recent years. Oxycodone, which was the most common drug cited in fatal overdoses in 2011, was eclipsed by heroin from 2012 to 2015, and then fentanyl in 2016. On average, the U.S. death rate involving fentanyl increased about 113 percent per year from 2013 to 2016.\n\nIn most of these cases, the researchers found that more than one drug was used, and from those data they were able to identify the most common combinations of drugs that led to fatal overdoses.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to tease out what specific effect one drug had versus another used at the same time (or what other medical factors may have contributed to the deaths), better understanding these drug combinations \u201chelps us identify potential areas of risk,\u201d Hedegaard said. For instance, about 40 percent of cocaine deaths also involved fentanyl.\n\nHedegaard and her co-authors used the same death certificates that the CDC typically uses for overdose reports but went deeper in their analysis, scouring the records for drug misspellings, chemical names, brand names and street names recorded by coroners and medical examiners.\n\nThe amount and quality of information on the reports varied widely. Death investigations, resources and reporting requirements differ from county to county and state to state, and medical examiners and coroners are a patchwork of officials and an unregulated group. In some municipalities, coroner is an elected or appointed position, not necessarily a medical doctor.\n\nThough reporting by medical examiners and coroners improved over the course of the report, Hedegaard noted, in 2016, 15 percent of drug overdose death certificates still didn\u2019t include any specific drug.\n\nAfter an in-depth analysis of the information, the researchers also found that certain drugs were more likely to be the cause of death in unintentional overdoses, while others were more likely to be implicated in death by suicide. In 2016, the street drugs fentanyl, heroin and cocaine were most frequently recorded in unintentional fatal overdoses, while prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including oxycodone, diphenhydramine, hydrocodone and alprazolam, were most frequently recorded in deaths by suicide.\n\nBetter understanding those patterns could help experts and policymakers who are working to end the nation\u2019s suicide and overdose crises."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "I\u2019m A Man And It Took Me Years To Recognize I Had Been Sexually Assaulted", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/men-sexual-assault_us_5c095ca1e4b0bf813ef54bb8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "If I could find a way to discuss the complexities of men\u2019s ability to admit when they\u2019ve been made victims of sexual assault without actually recounting my personal experience with it, I\u2019d do it. I can\u2019t.\n\nI still have trouble referring to what happened to me as assault. In fact, I utilize Olympic-level mental gymnastics to avoid that terminology, usually saying that I was on the receiving end of \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d or \u201cwas taken advantage of physically.\u201d It took me a year-and-a-half to even admit to myself that I wasn\u2019t OK with what happened, and another year for me to acknowledge the same thing to someone else.\n\nI was 23 years old, still in college (not-so-fun fact: male college students ages 18 to 24 are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted than members of the same demographic who aren\u2019t in college) and attending a massive event for the industry in which I was just starting to find my footing. At a large party the first night of the event, I was introduced to someone with whom I was familiar through social media. It was immediately evident she wasn\u2019t sober.\n\nAfter what I\u2019d generously estimate to be 90 seconds of small talk, she leaned forward and stuck her tongue down my throat. I pulled back. She proceeded to do it again twice more. I made a clumsy exit from the interaction, but periodically throughout the night she\u2019d find me again and make further drunken passes at me, both physical and verbal. For further context, she was several years older than me and had rising stock in our industry. I was still very much at the bottom of the proverbial totem pole.\n\nWhen I went back to my hotel that night, something felt off. There was a little voice in the back of my head telling me that something about what had happened wasn\u2019t normal, wasn\u2019t appropriate. I stifled that voice. In fact, the next morning, to cover up my abstract shame and discomfort (and to get ahead of any potential embarrassment had somebody seen it) I did the only thing I knew how to do: I bragged about it. I did everything I could to turn it into a crazy party story. I even instigated further contact with her, going so far as to try and see her a few nights later. See? I was OK. I was an active participant in the story, not a victim. Everything was fine.\n\nBut in the months that followed, I began to have panic attacks whenever I saw her at industry events. It only worsened when, in the midst of an interaction with a mutual friend, she joked about what had happened. I realized I never wanted to be in the same room as her again. The problem is that we worked in the same industry, so we were in the same room together often. Rather than speak up or seek closure (whatever that even means in situations like these), I let my feelings fester, until I slowly felt less and less at home in the environment I had worked so hard to earn my place in.\n\nStill, I didn\u2019t recognize what happened as sexual assault. I wouldn\u2019t let myself. Because there\u2019s a huge difference between recognizing that men can be victims of sexual assault and recognizing that you, a man, have been made a victim of sexual assault.\n\nI think one of the greatest fears men are conditioned to hold, even if they don\u2019t realize it, is the loss of autonomy. You are the master of your decisions and of your body. You are, at all times, In Control. To admit that you\u2019re a victim is to relinquish that fabrication of control. Admitting to yourself that you\u2019ve already lost it can break you.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a stereotype in our society that men are, well, always down for sex. A guy can\u2019t be the victim of an unwanted sexual advance because there\u2019s no such thing as a guy who isn\u2019t receptive to ANY sexual advance, at ANY time. Hell, men who do come forward with allegations of sexual assault are often told by someone (usually with an egg avatar on Twitter) that they\u2019re lucky, that they should be thankful for the experience, that they have nothing to complain about.\n\nSo, for nearly two years, I pretended I was OK with what had happened. I never let myself say the words \u201charassment\u201d or \u201cassault\u201d or \u201cvictim\u201d out loud, and every time they\u2019d pop into my head I\u2019d remind myself that I couldn\u2019t have been assaulted \u2015 if I were assaulted, why would I have kept talking to her? After all, I didn\u2019t not want to kiss her, I just didn\u2019t want to do it at that time, and that place, when she were in that condition. Plus it wasn\u2019t like I was, God forbid, forced into sex or anything. What did I have to complain about?\n\nI thought this in total ignorance of facts I already knew to be true \u2015 that victims often return to the people who assault them and try to make peace, and that mutual attraction doesn\u2019t negate a lack of consent. But of course, recognizing these things would mean admitting that I was a victim.\n\nIt\u2019s been some time now since the session with my therapist in which I finally realized that what happened wasn\u2019t consensual, and admitted to myself that I had been sexually assaulted. While it\u2019s still not something I share details of openly, the few friends and peers I\u2019ve talked about it with have been supportive and receptive, wholly understanding the situation and never questioning my take on the experience. I\u2019m lucky I was given the space to realize this, to admit that something had happened to me that contradicted my self-constructed identity as a \u201cman.\u201d\n\nUltimately, admitting you\u2019ve been assaulted doesn\u2019t signify a loss of autonomy or control \u2015 quite the opposite. To take control of your experiences and admit that something bad happened is taking back control. It\u2019s counteracting the negative stigma surrounding men openly discussing sexual assault. The toxicity of conditioned masculinity is a hell of a drug, though, and reaching a point where you\u2019re comfortable taking back that control can be daunting.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for the dialogue started by the Me Too movement and specifically Terry Crews sharing his experience with assault over the last year. It\u2019s created a space in which it feels safer for everyone, including men, to discuss the trauma that comes with being a victim of assault \u2015 a great deal of which is often self-inflicted.\n\nHowever, my situation isn\u2019t unique. I know men who have managed to convince themselves that they weren\u2019t assaulted, who have utilized the same mental gymnastics to remove the stigma of victimhood from their identity. It\u2019s not a healthy way to think.\n\nIn our ongoing and expanding dialogue on the nature of sexual assault, I only hope that we continue to encourage men to feel safe in recognizing their experiences with it. Vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness and victimhood need not be a badge of shame."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "New York City Will Lose One Of Its Few Birth Centers.

Sinai West hospital on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side last May \u2014 and right away, she wanted out. The room was cramped. Julia, who asked to use only her first name for privacy reasons, was hooked up to a monitor that allowed nurses to check the baby\u2019s heart rate, but also meant she couldn\u2019t move. She felt claustrophobic.\n\nAs Julia dealt with contractions, her midwife was locked in her own battle, quietly negotiating with hospital staff to ensure her patient could move to the Birthing Center \u2014 a three-room unit that has, since 1996, been a destination for New York City women seeking low-intervention vaginal births. Julia chose Mt. Sinai West specifically for the Birthing Center and met the criteria women must to deliver there: her pregnancy was low-risk and she\u2019d gone into labor naturally, right around her due date.\n\nThe only question was whether the hospital, which is permanently closing the Birthing Center on Dec. 31, would staff it with a few nurses for Julia. Frustrated midwives, moms and doulas who spoke to HuffPost say that even before Mt. Sinai West announced the upcoming closure with little warning last summer, the Birthing Center had been limping along, often inaccessible to women who have registered to deliver there.\n\nJulia got in, and describes an immediate shift in her experience. The room was large. It had a bed big enough for her husband to sit in with her, and a Jacuzzi tub that helped enormously with her labor pain. There were homey touches like floral curtains, and the medical equipment was mostly hidden out of sight. Most of all, the room felt calm. Aside from the comings and goings of two nurses, Julia\u2019s husband, her doula and her midwife, things were quiet and still.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel like I was in a hospital anymore. It felt like I was in some weird, pleasant, Laura Ashley hotel. Julia, onetime patient at the Birthing Center\n\n\u201cIt felt surreal in a really positive way. It didn\u2019t feel like I was in a hospital anymore. It felt like I was in some weird, pleasant, Laura Ashley hotel,\u201d Julia, 33, told HuffPost of her May delivery.\n\n\u201cI was completely naked the whole time,\u201d she added with a chuckle. \u201cAnd for me to be completely naked means I\u2019m in a very comfortable environment.\u201d\n\nBirthing tubs, big beds and nudity might sound trivial in the broader scheme of bringing a new person safely into the world. But to women like Julia, they\u2019re hallmarks of a rare hybrid birth environment offering women who want a more \u201cnatural\u201d birth experience \u2014 by which people typically mean vaginal, with minimal interventions and no epidural \u2014 a shot at it, all within a modern, full-service hospital. They represent choice.\n\nMany women prepare for their due dates with a birth plan, which may include anything from a playlist of music they\u2019d like to hear to what medications and procedures they do or do not want performed, if the circumstances allow. Of course, often those plans have to be changed on the fly to address the safety of both mom and baby. But at birth centers \u2014 where the guiding ethos is to prioritize low-intervention vaginal birth and to honor, whenever possible, a woman\u2019s wishes \u2014 women can take comfort in knowing they are, at a minimum, setting themselves up for a good shot at having the kind of birth they seek as opposed to delivering on a labor and delivery floor where their chance of medical intervention can be determined as much by hospital procedures or which doctor happens to be on-call that night as by the specific circumstances of their labor. Fans of the in-hospital birth center model say it is what makes the three-room unit at Mt. Sinai West so special \u2014 and what makes its closure so disheartening, not just to residents of New York City but to women and experts across the nation advocating for obstetric choice.\n\n\u201cIn a hospital, interventions meant to improve safety can sometimes interfere with normal physiology,\u201d Jessica Illuzzi, an OB-GYN and section chief of Yale School of Medicine\u2019s Obstetric and Midwifery section who is on the board of the American Association of Birth Centers, told HuffPost. But it\u2019s possible for hospitals to implement treatment protocols that maintain safety standards while still giving women the space and support to follow their bodies\u2019 cues and hew to their physiologic, or natural, birth plans.\n\n\u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to seek home birth to have an experience like this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey should be able to give birth in a hospital feeling supported no matter when they go into labor and what team happens to be on [call].\u201d\n\nThe Best Of Both Worlds\n\nWhen the Birthing Center at Mt. Sinai West (previously St. Luke\u2019s Roosevelt hospital) opened in 1996 \u2014 the first of its kind in a New York City hospital \u2014 it promised women a different experience from that on traditional labor and delivery floors. It offered the best of both worlds: a low-intervention approach with immediate backup when necessary.\n\n\u201cA lot of women don\u2019t want to have a home birth, but this sort of has a home birth feel to it,\u201d said Risa Klein, a certified nurse midwife with admitting privileges at Mt. Sinai West.\n\nAt the Birthing Center, births are largely overseen by midwives and many standard hospital policies for laboring women \u2014 limits on what they can eat, drink, and wear, as well as continuous fetal monitoring or routinely giving women IV fluids \u2014 do not apply. Klein said her patients are able to work through contractions on an inflatable birthing ball, for example, or use a squatting bar to support them as they try out different positions to try and minimize pain or bear down to push the baby out. Women are encouraged to eat what they want, to bring in electric candles and turn down the lights if they\u2019d like and to labor in the tub if that helps ease the pain of contractions.\n\n\u201cWomen are making a choice, and I too made a choice to come to St. Luke\u2019s Roosevelt to attend birth in the birthing center,\u201d said Klein, who moved her practice from New Jersey to New York a decade ago.\n\nOne reason some women seek out birthing centers \u2014 which make it a priority to reduce medical and surgical interventions during childbirth \u2014 is to avoid having a C-section if possible.\n\nNationally, more than 30 percent of all deliveries are via Cesarean section, and while it can be necessary and save lives, public health experts \u2014 and moms \u2014 have worried for decades about its overuse. Surgical deliveries, while generally safe, do carry health risks and can be considerably more expensive. Researchers quibble over what an appropriate goal C-section rate looks like, but generally agree that when it exceeds 10 to 20 percent of births, any benefits to moms and babies plateau. Studies also show that there is astounding variation in C-section rates across U.S. hospitals \u2014 from 7 percent in some to 70 percent in others. As a recent Consumer Reports investigation put it, the single biggest determinant in whether a woman has a C-section in this country is the hospital where she gives birth.\n\nBut C-sections are sometimes necessary, and when emergencies arise, a laboring woman must be transferred to a hospital for care.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really special about what\u2019s now called Mt. Sinai West is that right, one floor above this birthing center, you have state-of-the-art operating rooms,\u201d said Klein. \u201cBecause things can happen in birth. You\u2019ve got a really safe haven at this hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome women feel the rate of Cesarean is so high that they choose out of hospital birth,\u201d said Illuzzi. \u201cAs an obstetrician, I would prefer that we improve birth in the hospital and attract them to the hospital by offering them a birth center model of care in the hospital. I am very concerned that Mt. Sinai would be choosing to limit this option for women.\u201d\n\nThe American Association of Birth Centers (AABC) says there are currently 355 birth centers nationwide, up from 124 in the mid-1980s. Those numbers include only freestanding centers that meet the group\u2019s standards for what can and cannot be offered to laboring moms. \u201cWe only help low-risk women. There\u2019s no anesthesia offered at a birth center. We don\u2019t do forceps or vacuums. Surgery isn\u2019t offered. We don\u2019t induce or augment labor with pitocin. Continued electronic fetal monitoring isn\u2019t used. We don\u2019t [deliver] breech [babies] or twins,\u201d explained Amy Johnson-Grass, AABC president.\n\nThere has been some research showing freestanding birth centers have good outcomes for moms and babies, including a recent report from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation that suggests freestanding birth centers have the potential to lower C-section rates among low-income women and decrease the number of babies born premature. A 2013 study of outcomes among women who delivered at 79 AABC member birth centers \u2014 co-authored by Illuzzi \u2014 was similarly positive, finding that the C-section rate was roughly 6 percent (those women went to a hospital for the surgery) and 1 percent required the use of forceps or a vacuum. (Those are generally used only in later labor when it has stalled or when the baby\u2019s health is in danger, and pose some risk to moms and babies.) Those findings are limited by the fact that they were based on voluntary data provided by the birth centers.\n\nBut other research suggests there are real risks associated with out-of-hospital births, most notably a 2015 study that found fetal death was higher in planned home births and freestanding birth center births than in hospitals. Illuzzi pushed back on that research, saying it unfairly lumped together all out-of-hospital births \u2015 including those done at home with a lay midwife, and those performed by a nurse-midwife at a birth center with a transfer agreement with a hospital. Her point of contention underscores why an in-hospital birth center is, in many ways, an ideal compromise for laboring women. If an emergency arises, they are only seconds away from an operating room or from a NICU.\n\nThough there is no research that specifically compares in-hospital birth center outcomes with those on traditional labor and delivery floors, both Illuzzi and Johnson-Grass agree that the model offers women the potential for a low-intervention birth in a relatively homelike environment along with the benefits of a hospital delivery.\n\nThere is not data on how many in-hospital birth centers there are nationwide, largely because there isn\u2019t a precise definition of what that means. Experts say many labor units call themselves \u201cbirth centers,\u201d but do not meet the criteria set forth by groups like the AABC and the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers \u2014 even those that have adopted certain practices aimed at minimizing obstetrical intervention.\n\nThe Birthing Center at Mt. Sinai West is among what experts estimate are only a handful of true in-hospital birth centers in the country.\n\nOne Less Choice\n\nMt. Sinai West has said it is closing the Birthing Center in order to add 13 new NICU beds as well as 15 new postpartum beds \u2014 expansions it called \u201ccritically necessary\u201d in an email to HuffPost. It said the hospital will continue to support women who want a low-intervention birth and those who hope to deliver with a midwife.\n\n\u201cThe newly configured Labor and Delivery area and NICU expansion will allow us to improve patient safety, comfort, and delivery of critical care to all mothers and infants, especially ill or premature newborn infants,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWhile the three rooms that currently comprise the Birthing Center will no longer exist after December 2018, we will continue to support every woman\u2019s birthing choice and will accommodate any delivery option they choose.\u201d Hospital representatives did not offer specifics on how it would support these choices.\n\nThose fighting to keep the Birthing Center open allege that closing it amounts to little more than a money-making scheme for the hospital, pointing out that private rooms at Mt. Sinai West currently cost $900 a night. (Mt. Sinai declined to comment on whether the 15 new postpartum beds would be in private rooms.) A Change.org petition started by a group calling itself Save The Birthing Center has more than 15,000 signatures. The group contends the hospital has artificially deflated the number of women who deliver at the Birthing Center by only staffing it at certain times.\n\nIf you remove options for women who want to try for a safe, unmedicated birth, I think that is disempowering. Robyn, onetime patient of the Birthing Center\n\nAs the clock runs out on the Birthing Center, pregnant women who had hoped to deliver there are searching for other providers who will support their effort to pursue a low-intervention birth, particularly as there are now only two birth centers left in New York City \u2014 only one of which is in a hospital: There are two birthing suites at New York-Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital, and the freestanding Brooklyn Birthing Center in Midwood. Women like Robyn, 35, who was 16 weeks pregnant with her second child when she spoke with HuffPost.\n\nRobyn, who also asked that only her first name be used, labored at the Birthing Center at Mt. Sinai West with her first baby, and though she was ultimately transferred to the labor and delivery unit as her labor dragged on \u2014 seeking an epidural and some relief from the pain \u2014 she remembers the 10 hours she spent there fondly. Looking back, she feels confident she gave herself the best possible shot at having the kind of birth experience she dreamt of by at least starting out in the Birthing Center, where she felt certain the policies and providers were supportive of her vision.\n\n\u201cEven though I ended up going into [the labor and delivery unit] and getting an epidural, I feel like childbirth was the biggest accomplishment of my life. It\u2019s just incredible,\u201d said Robyn. \u201cAnd if you remove options for women who want to try for a safe, unmedicated birth, I think that is disempowering.\u201d\n\nRobyn does not know where she will deliver now, and she said she is feeling a lot of stress about transferring to a provider who will support her as she tries for a low-intervention second birth."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture.

More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings.

She had been working as a high-profile journalist for New York magazine, hiding the fact that she grew up extremely poor, when one day she encountered her homeless mother on the street \u2014 an experience that filled her with shame, and which she subsequently used as the opening scene of her book.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I was surviving in a world that wasn\u2019t mine, and I was going to get \u2018found out,\u2019 and exposed and people would literally throw things at me, the way they did when I was a kid,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it got to the point where I was tired of hiding. The story needed to be told, and I needed to be the one to tell it.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that no one actually threw eggs at her. In fact, facing her fears and telling her story changed her life for the better. \u201cI\u2019m so much happier now,\u201d Ms. Walls says."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "What We Know About Diet and Weight Loss", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/diet-weight-loss.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "So does a low-carbohydrate diet help people burn more calories? Or is the composition of the diet irrelevant if the calories are the same? Does it matter if the question is how to lose weight or how to keep it off? There was no consensus at the end of the session. But here are a few certainties about dieting amid the sea of unknowns.\n\nWhat we know\n\nPeople vary \u2014 a lot \u2014 in how they respond to dieting.\n\nSome people thrive on low-fat diets, others do best on low-carb diets. Still others succeed with gluten-free diets or Paleo diets or periodic fasts or ketogenic diets or other options on the seemingly endless menu of weight-loss plans.\n\nMost studies comparing diets have produced results like Dr. Gardner\u2019s: no difference in weight loss between study groups as long as the calorie intake was kept equal. But within each group, there always have been a few individuals who lost a lot of weight, a few who did not lose any weight, and a few who actually gained.\n\nDr. George Bray, an obesity researcher who is emeritus professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., sums it up this way: \u201cEat the diet you like and stay with it.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing new in the diet universe.\n\nMany of the diets people swear by today have been around in various incarnations for decades. More than a century ago, a best-selling book, \u201cHow to Live,\u201d told Americans that the only way to lose weight was to count calories."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "What These Medical Journals Don\u2019t Reveal: Top Doctors\u2019 Ties to Industry", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/health/medical-journals-conflicts-of-interest.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-12 19:01:54", "body_paragraphs": "For example, the American Association for Cancer Research has warned authors that they face a three-year ban if they are found to have omitted a potential conflict. But the group\u2019s policy on conflicts of interest contains no mention of such a penalty, and it said no author had ever been barred. Dr. Baselga\u2019s failure to disclose his industry relationships extended to the association\u2019s journal, Cancer Discovery, for which he serves as one of two editors in chief. The association said it is investigating Dr. Baselga\u2019s actions.\n\nMost authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon.\n\nThe Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley\u2019s behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts.\n\nThe Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a \u201cuniversal disclosure\u201d practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions.\n\n\u201cWe believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,\u201d the center said.\n\nASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris\u2019s disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 \u2014 as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization \u2014 it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019.\n\n\u201cDisclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO\u2019s,\u201d the group said in an email."}]
