And they saw Tuesday's results as a victory for white America with what they believe will be progress toward a border wall, an end to DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and birthright citizenship.\n\nMemes and commentary on the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer site bashed nonwhite candidates who did not win, as well as losses by Republicans not seen as Trump loyalists.\n\n\"This changed history. It cleared away any of the remaining fog of confusion about what exactly we are dealing with in this country,\" Daily Stormer founder and publisher Andrew Anglin wrote. \"This is a race war. Period.\"\n\nWhat is not clear is if any extremists will follow words with violence, as allegedly happened with Robert Bowers, who has pleaded not guilty to killing 11 people at a synagogue late last month , allegedly because he believed Jews were helping \"invaders.\"\n\nThe victory of Rep. Steve King, pictured, was especially significant to white nationalists like Andrew Anglin.\n\nAnglin was buoyed by the win of Rep. Steve King in Iowa , even after King was pilloried for meeting with a far-right Austrian group linked to Nazis and retweeting an avowed Nazi sympathizer. King, a Republican, says he was unaware of the Nazi links in both those instances, but he has used racially charged and anti-immigrant rhetoric for years.\n\nKing still won with 50.6% of the vote in Iowa's deeply conservative 4th Congressional District. In Illinois, Arthur Jones, a self-declared Holocaust denier and former leader of the American Nazi Party tallied almost 56,000 votes, more than a quarter of the total, standing for the GOP in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District.\n\n\"Steve King won,\" Anglin wrote. \"If last night was a referendum on Steve King's white nationalism, as the Democrats were trying to frame it, then white nationalism won.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail for Sen. Ted Cruz fighting for re-election in Texas, Trump declared, \"I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.\"\n\nHe told the crowd, \"We're not supposed to use that word,\" perhaps because he knew of its overtones of cultural superiority to others.\n\nTrump batted away a question about whether his words emboldend white nationalists, saying the question itself was racist.\n\nBut he would not clarify when asked about it the day after the election by Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS Newshour,\" who said of his words, \"Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\" Trump brushed her off with \"That's such a racist question.\"\n\nWhen she followed up with, \"There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric,\" he replied: \"Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.\"\n\nBut others apparently do believe it.\n\nA commenter on the 4chan bulletin board joked Trump was winking at them.\n\nEarlier, another poster declared Trump was venerated by white supremacists: \"What Dems, all leftists and pundits do not understand is that TRUMP is patriots' and Western/American Heritage's CHAMPION.\"\n\nTo Alcindor, Trump repeated two more times how racist the question was. But he also never flatly denounced white supremacists. They were overjoyed, calling the press conference \"glorious,\" and \"beautiful\" on 4chan, with one commenter writing: \"I am honestly in awe of this man as a leader.\"\n\nKeegan Hankes reviews propaganda from the far right for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"It doesn't take an overt slur for these individuals to basically become emboldened and to recognize and be excited by policies that they see would further their goals,\" said Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project.\n\n\"When they hear the President say things like, 'I'm not a racist,' they turn around amongst themselves and say, 'He just has to say that for practical reasons,' 'he just has to say that basically to get himself cover, to do the things that we want him to do,'\" Hankes says.\n\nThat was also the reaction after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August last year where torch-carrying crowds marched through the streets saying: \"Jews will not replace us.\" A woman was killed when a car was driven into a group of counterprotesters.\n\n\"You had some very bad people in that group,\" Trump said in remarks about the Unite The Right rally. \"But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\n\"President Trump's response to Charlottesville absolutely legitimized these individuals,\" Hankes says.\n\nWhile some language is seen as a \"dog whistle\" -- a code heard with a special meaning by the like-minded -- at other times, harsh and false terminology from the White House takes over.\n\nTrump was combative with reporters the day after the elections, doubling down on his assertion that migrants in Mexico were would-be invaders.\n\nAt the Wednesday news conference, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Trump on his description of the caravan of Central American migrants heading through Mexico toward the United States as an \"invasion\" when it was not.\n\nBut Trump batted away the challenge. \"I consider it an invasion,\" Trump told Acosta.\n\nOn places like 4chan, false talk of the migrant caravan as \"invaders\" has taken over on some of the message boards and become a popular meme topic. Analysts say \"the browning of America\" where whites become a minority is what the white supremacists fear most.\n\nThere are threads with memes containing photos doctored to look like people breaking down walls at the US border with Mexico. There are jokes about how the traditional rush of Black Friday shoppers is nothing compared to what would happen next. In another thread on 4chan, commentators speculate about how many people would be shot as they come over the border. The thread appeared to reference Trump's comment that US troops on the border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones. \"All of them,\" one poster wrote of a possible casualty count. \"Not enough,\" said another.\n\nThe Daily Stormer publisher exhorted his readers to go to the polls with this post featuring President Trump.\n\nBefore the midterm election, the Daily Stormer site urged followers to vote for their overt and implicit agendas. It featured a flashing image of Donald Trump front and center with the words \"it's happening.\" There was also a vile meme on the site, which is visited more than 2.5 million times a month, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb. A commenter posted a picture of white men dressed for war with the words \"us if we win\" followed by \"them if we win\" on a photo of Jews being led to slaughter at gas chambers during the Holocaust.\n\nThe administration's approach to immigration in particular has \"electrified\" many racists, Hankes said, \"to the point where they're begging their followers to go out and find ways to put Republicans in office.\"\n\n\"They believe it will be easier for these policies to sail through,\" he said. \"And these are things that they think are essential for creating a white ethno-state.\"\n\nPerhaps this election did energize white nationalists to vote, if they thought they had a champion in government. But there is also the fear -- and the example -- of men taking matters into their own violent hands.\n\nBowers, the accused synagogue killer, echoed Trump talking points when he wrote on the free-speech forum Gab that \"I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders'.\" The post, made six days before the shooting, continued, \"I like this.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Analysis: Fury over the midterms is fueling Trump", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hwqIB6BMQVg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is intensifying his challenge to constitutional constraints and governing norms that are already facing their gravest test since Watergate in the 1970s.\n\nTrump has reacted to the coming Democratic majority in the House by upping the assault on the Washington system he was elected to upend, but in a way that could be taking the nation into perilous political territory.\n\nIn the days since the fracturing of the Republican majority on power in Washington, Trump has challenged political order across a broad front.\n\nThe President has installed Matthew Whitaker, an acolyte who shares his skepticism of the Mueller probe as acting attorney general. In addition, he has stoked conspiracy theories about stolen elections in the wake of Florida's latest vote counting controversy and has threatened to use the mechanisms of government to investigate Democrats if they investigate him.\n\nAnd he has stepped up his assault on the press, including by confiscating the White House pass of CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who asked multiple, challenging questions of Trump during a White House news conference.\n\nAll of this came days after Trump used his power as commander-in-chief to dispatch troops to the border to meet what he said was an imminent criminal invasion from a migrant caravan that is yet to materialize.\n\nThe President's moves, with the prospect of more to come, have precipitated a surreal moment in politics, with Washington veterans debating whether a constitutional crisis is looming \u2014 or whether it is already here.\n\nDoes the acting AG threaten the rule of law?\n\nThe current epicenter of the debate concerns Whitaker, the former chief of staff to fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions who took his boss's job.\n\n\"He should never have been appointed and ... it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country,\" the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nGrowing questions over Whitaker's position will hike pressure on the President to swiftly nominate a permanent attorney general. But that nominee will face an inquisition from the Republican-led Senate over their positions on the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker's critics fear he will refuse to sign off on subpoenas Mueller might request, narrow the mandate of his investigation or suppress the special counsel's final report.\n\nHis appointment has raised fears that the President intends to use him to derail the Russia investigation. That is a realistic possibility since Trump already admitted in an NBC interview last year that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the investigation -- a move that critics say in itself amounts to an abuse of power and obstruction of justice.\n\nWhitaker appears unlikely to heed calls to recuse himself from the probe given a decision by Sessions to do so sparked Trump's fury and poisoned his tenure.\n\nIt may fall to the new Democratic House majority, therefore, to act as a check on any attempts by Trump to use Whitaker to interfere with Mueller, despite the President's challenge to legal norms represented by his appointment.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nThe President has frequently made claims of massive voter fraud in the United States, despite the fact that all available evidence suggests that it is not a significant problem.\n\nSo it is no surprise that he has leapt into action to proclaim that Florida's latest vote controversy is a flagrant example of Democratic larceny at the polls.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning after having spent the weekend in Paris.\n\nAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\n\nNo one is disputing the Sunshine's State's unfortunate tendency to trigger election controversy. And answers are overdue about the stewardship of elections in Broward and Palm Beach counties for instance.\n\nLawyers for Democratic and Republican candidates are now launching dueling campaigns. Each side has every right to make their case after the state's Republican secretary of state ordered recounts to begin given thin margins.\n\n\"Every vote should be counted, but, by gosh, not let fraudulent or anti-Constitutional behavior prevail,\" Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who ran the Republican Senate midterm campaign, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nBut Trump seems to be reacting not to evidence of fraud, but to vote counts that are narrowing the gap between Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum and the presumed Republican victors.\n\nThus the Florida controversy marks the latest occasion when he is prioritizing his personal interests over a President's duty to protect the nation's democracy.\n\nBut by intervening personally in the race, the President is casting doubt on the integrity of the election and potentially risking long-term damage to America's political system itself, which relies on public consent.\n\nHis furious intervention contrasts with the reaction of President Bill Clinton during an even higher-stakes confrontation in Florida, the bitterly contested recount in the 2000 presidential election, eventually handed to George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore by the Supreme Court.\n\nClinton took steps to avoid politicizing the process, reasoning that America's system depended on him staying out of it.\n\n\"I don't think I should be involved in that,\" Clinton said soon after the disputed election.\n\nTrump's intervention 18 years later is one reason why his critics fear he is oblivious or disdainful of traditional norms governing presidential behavior.\n\nLashing out at scrutiny\n\nThe Democratic capture of the House guarantees an uncomfortable period of investigation and oversight for the White House that the Republican majority deemed unnecessary during his first two years in office.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nIn the latest worrying sign for the President, top Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler told Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Democrats would examine hush payments to women who allege past affairs with Trump that may infringe campaign finance laws.\n\n\"That might very well be an impeachable offense,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump has denied the alleged affairs.\n\nThe President already reacted with fury to the notion of a new era of scrutiny from Democrats, promising a \"warlike\" posture if it took place, and hinted he could use the mechanisms of government to investigate them during a news conference last week.\n\nThe President also acted in a way many observers fear raises First Amendment questions by taking the unprecedented step of confiscating Acosta's permanent White House press pass after he questioned the President on the migrant caravan.\n\nHow deep is the crisis?\n\nEvents of the last few days point clearly to an escalating challenge by the White House to political conventions and guardrails, one that could further sharpen if Trump's reshuffle of top officials rids him of remaining restraining influences.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the President's actions have already tipped the nation into a constitutional crisis or whether the system of checks and balances has kept him on the right side of that line.\n\nAfter all, two years after he was elected, voters did decide to introduce new accountability in Washington with a Democratic House after Republicans gave no sign they were willing to rein in the President's excesses.\n\nThe courts have tempered some of Trump's most radical ideas, watering down a Muslim travel ban he authored early in his presidency. Trump's new use of executive power to limit asylum claims, in an apparent contravention of international law, will soon get its own day in court.\n\nBut political systems need to be nurtured constantly if they are to remain healthy. And the President's rhetoric on the Florida controversy especially seems to edge close to the danger zone.\n\nOne veteran observer, Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and defense secretary under President Barack Obama, believes the nation's institutions are standing firm.\n\n\"I think ultimately the institutions that our forefathers put in place are strong enough to be able to survive any administration,\" Panetta said Thursday on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nBut the fact that the question is even relevant is testimony to the darkening mood in Washington."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sinema wins Arizona Senate race", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/LE_cKXnpQ64/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema will win Arizona's US Senate race, defeating Republican Rep. Martha McSally and flipping a seat that had been in GOP hands for 24 years.\n\nMcSally conceded the hard-fought race on Monday night -- six days after the election -- as county-by-county tallies of mailed-in ballots continued to increase Sinema's lead.\n\n\"I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on becoming Arizona's first female senator after a hard-fought battle. I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\" McSally said in a video posted on Twitter Monday night.\n\nCongrats to @kyrstensinema . I wish her success. I'm grateful to all those who supported me in this journey. I'm inspired by Arizonans' spirit and our state's best days are ahead of us. pic.twitter.com/tw0uKgi3oO\n\nThe concession by McSally means the Senate will have 51 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the upcoming Congress. The Senate race in Florida remains undecided and the Mississippi Senate race is going to a runoff later this month.\n\nThe win comes despite President Donald Trump and Republicans pushing false conspiracy theories about why ballots in Arizona were taking so long to count.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday that \"electoral corruption\" was taking place and suggested Arizona should have a new election. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in an email to reporters, accused the Maricopa County recorder of trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nThe reality is about three-fourths of Arizona's ballots are cast by mail. Because of a state law requiring ballots to be sealed and signed, and signatures to match those on voter registration forms, it routinely takes the state longer than most to tally its results.\n\nMcSally's campaign and state-level GOP officials ignored national Republicans' tactics of casting doubt on the election's results.\n\nA shifting Sun Belt\n\nSinema's victory showed that Democrats are continuing to gain momentum in the rapidly diversifying Sun Belt and firmly places Arizona among the most important presidential and Senate battlegrounds.\n\nThe race was certain to deliver Arizona its first female senator. And it came at a time of major change in the state's delegation.\n\nTrump long sought to recruit a Republican to run in the primary against Sen. Jeff Flake, a critic of the President's incendiary rhetoric. At a 2017 rally in Phoenix, Trump huddled backstage with then-state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham and then-Rep. Trent Franks to discuss a potential primary.\n\nRather than face an all-but-certain loss to a Trump-aligned candidate in a primary, Flake retired, opening up the seat on this year's ballot.\n\nThen, in August, longtime GOP Sen. John McCain died. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican former Sen. Jon Kyl to the seat, but Kyl has committed to filling it only through this year -- leaving the possibility that Ducey could have to select another new senator in the coming weeks or months. Either way, McCain's seat is on the ballot in 2020 and is sure to be a top Democratic target.\n\nThe upheaval comes as Arizona, long a Republican bastion, emerges as a swing state in presidential elections. Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by just 4 percentage points there. The result, and the state's growing Latino population, solidified Arizona as a battleground moving forward.\n\nThe fight between McSally and Sinema was bitter, with both drastically shifting their previous positions.\n\nAttempting to prove her conservative bona fides during a primary fight with former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, McSally abandoned her previous support for moderate immigration bills.\n\nSinema's House record ranks her among the most centrist Democrats -- but McSally seized on her rival's past as an anti-war activist, airing a television advertisement featuring Sinema protesting in a pink tutu. McSally told The Arizona Republic that Sinema \"has a lot of explaining to do if you look at her Green Party-pink tutu, proud Prada socialist past and her extreme makeover.\"\n\nLatino Democratic strategists, meanwhile, groused that Sinema had moved too far right on immigration to appeal to a crucial, growing portion of the Democratic electorate.\n\nThe focal point of the contest, though, was health care -- particularly pre-existing conditions. Sinema and Democratic groups lambasted McSally's vote for a House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare, which nonpartisan experts said would weaken the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMcSally responded with advertisements claiming to be \"leading the fight\" to ensure those people are protected -- even though, under Obamacare, they already are, and the fight in Congress was over Republicans' efforts to change those protections."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "CNN reporter explains why McSally lost", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/66E8V6UpbWo/arizona-senate-race-kyrsten-sinema-wins-martha-mcsally-concedes-ac360-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nUS intelligence has long assessed that the North Koreans have stored much of their weapons capability, including mobile missile launchers, in underground mountain bunkers.\n\nSpecifically, the images focus on the Sakkanmol missile base, which \"currently houses a unit equipped with short-range ballistic missiles but could easily accommodate more capable medium-range ballistic warheads.\"\n\n\"Despite the difference in interpretation between the US government and the North Koreans over what these declarations have meant, the Singapore declaration and the new Korean declaration, for North Korea watchers it has been pretty clear that the North has not been willing to give up its entire nuclear program, Lisa Collins a fellow with the Korea Chair at CSIS and one of the authors of the report, told CNN.\n\nMonday's report comes days after Trump told reporters his administration is \"very happy with how it's going with North Korea\" despite the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as last week's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\nTrump has conveyed a starkly different image than the one painted by US military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments who told CNN that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang previously told CNN that North Korea's stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nBut the US appears unwilling to oblige, at the moment, according to a US official, who said the Trump administration wants to move away from the \"tit-for-tat\" approach of the past.\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece. ... We haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nNorth Korea has often argued it is unable to provide comprehensive details about the locations of its nuclear and missile sites because that could serve as a target list should the situation escalate into an armed conflict. But Collins said that the hope is that \"this type of analysis and data would help to push forward the negotiations rather than cause more blockage.\"\n\n\"It would actually get rid of one of the primary excuses or reasons why North Korea has not produced a list,\" she said, adding that \"open source and independent data\" can help the process as US officials might be wary of publicly disclosing information that they believe could compromise sources and methods.\n\nWhen asked about Monday's new report, a State Department spokesperson implored Kim to \"follow through on his commitments -- including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs.\"\n\n\"President Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2014 including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2014 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n\nBut experts point out that Kim has not offered to stop producing ballistic missiles, let alone unilaterally give them up, and said on New Year's Day that he would continue to mass-produce ballistic missiles and deploy those that have already been tested.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that the images once again show that Trump's comments on North Korea have been a \"fabrication.\"\n\n\"The North Koreans have not signed any document working out, laying out, what steps they are going to take to denuclearize,\" Hagel said. \"There has been nothing stated, agreed to, framed signed, except what President Trump says they've said ... but now ... we have a whole different story, and it is the reality, it is not fantasy,\" he added.\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN that Kim's actions do not amount to \"deception since he said on New Year's Day that North Korea would mass-produce and deploy its missiles that it already tested.\"\n\nNarang added that the images released Monday identify \"operating bases which, until and unless there is a deal, Kim can't eliminate without undermining his security.\"\n\nAsked about the State Department's response to Monday's report, Narang called the assertion that North Korea has committed to eliminating its ballistic missile programs is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"There has been no agreement or discussion remotely that detailed --- even on nuclear systems, and many of these are short range conventional missiles which North Korea has never said were on the table,\" he told CNN.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN that experts have known about these sites for years, and it is no surprise that they remain operational given Kim's declaration in January that North Korea would shift from research and development to the mass-production of nuclear systems.\n\n\"Kim didn't dupe Trump. Trump duped himself,\" Lewis said, noting that North Korea has never offered to unilaterally disarm.\n\nSakkanmol missile base is one of the facilities where North Korea deploys its mass produced systems, he said.\n\nStill, Trump has sought to convey the image that progress continues to be made and teased a possible second summit with Kim in the near future.\n\n\"We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference last week. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nIn July, Trump touted indications that North Korea had begun dismantling \"a key missile site\" after the prominent monitoring group 38 North published images showing Pyongyang had begun decommissioning its Sohae Satellite Launching Station.\n\nBut while that step attracted significant media attention at the time, Monday's report states that the dismantling of the Sohae facility \"obscures the military threat to US forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases.\"\n\nCollins told CNN that she believes one reason North Korea canceled the latest round of talks with Pompeo is because they might be targeting \"the very top levels of negotiations\" -- another meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nHowever, she also warned that \"you can't get anywhere without these working-level talks because that's where the nitty-gritty stuff happens.\"\n\n\"You can't get a verifiable list of anything unless nuclear weapons experts are part of the process,\" she said. \"Is President Trump going to create a list of all those facilities? Does he even know where some of these places are? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\n\"There have to be working-level talks, but the North Koreans are clearly targeting a big package deal, for them, which can only happen if President Trump is there to make the decision,\" Collins added. \"But I think the US has been very cautious and careful to keep the negotiations moving forward at the working level and try not to have President Trump jump every time there is an offer.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "44 dead in California fires as the Camp Fire becomes the deadliest in state history", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/amCJXBsI8WM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An additional 13 sets of human remains were discovered Monday in Northern California, bringing the death toll from the Camp Fire to 42, making it the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, the sheriff of Butte County said.\n\nThe increased death toll comes as first responders battle blazes on both ends of the state, and brings the statewide death toll to 44.\n\nFierce winds continue to threaten lives and homes in Southern California's Woolsey Fire, which has killed two people so far. The strongest Santa Ana winds in the south may bring gusts near hurricane force on Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.\n\nMeanwhile, firefighters made progress Monday in containing the Camp Fire, which razed the town of Paradise, where most of the dead have been found. Harrowing stories of escapes and close calls are trickling out of the region.\n\nResident Nichole Jolly said she thought her life was over as flames surrounded her car, filling it with smoke. Then, she called her husband, who urged her to run, she said.\n\n\"If you're going to die, die fighting,\" she said, tearfully recalling his words.\n\nOutside the vehicle, ash and hot embers stung her eyes and obscured her vision, she said. She felt around until she reached a fire engine that was hot to the touch. Firefighters pulled her inside, but they, too, were trapped, she said -- until a bulldozer came through and cleared a path to safety.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cell phone videos show drivers fleeing fire Replay More Videos ...

President Trump on Monday approved a request for a Major Disaster Declaration that will provide the state with federal resources.\n\nA Malibu resident who has lived through many wildfires said she has never seen one touch so many parts of the city at once.\n\n\"Every community neighborhood has been devastated,\" the woman told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS\n\nLatest developments by the numbers\n\n\u2022 Camp Fire: More than 52,000 have been evacuated and 1,385 are in shelters due to the Camp Fire. It has scorched more than 117,000 acres of Northern California, and destroyed more than 7,000 structures, including 6,453 single-family residences.\n\nAs of Monday night, it was about 30% contained.\n\n\u2022 Woolsey Fire: In Southern California, 57,000 structures are threatened by the Woolsey Fire. It has burned more than 93,000 acres, killed two people and destroyed at least 435 structures. As of Monday, it was about 30% contained.\n\n\u2022 The Hill Fire covered 4,531 acres and was 85% contained by Monday night.\n\nCauses of fires still being investigated\n\nThe death toll is rising as California state regulators investigate two utility companies that reported incidents close in time and location to the start of the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\nPreliminary incident reports submitted last week to the Safety and Enforcement Division of the California Public Utilities Commission provide a glimpse of conditions near the origins of the deadly blazes. Both utilities say they are cooperating with state investigators.\n\nAlmost 15 minutes before the Camp Fire began near Pulga, PG&E's said it experienced a transmission line outage about 1 mile northeast of the town.\n\nIn Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire began Thursday afternoon in unincorporated Ventura County, SoCal Edison reported that a circuit relayed out of the Chatsworth Substation about two minutes before the blaze broke out. The incident location in the report appears to be the same as CalFire's location for the fire's origin. But it's not clear how close they actually are to each other.\n\nSoCal Edison's report says, \"at this point we have no indication from fire agency personnel that SCE utility facilities may have been involved in the start of the fire.\"\n\nA CPUC spokesperson said the agency will incorporate the incident reports into its staff investigations to assess the compliance of electric facilities with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the fires.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California An air tanker drops water on a fire along the Ronald Reagan Freeway in Simi Valley, California, on Monday, November 12.

The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nThe evacuees included celebrities who lost their homes in Malibu as well as first responders who are setting aside their grief to save others. While much of Malibu lies in ruins, the city's mayor pro tem, Jefferson 'Zuma Jay' Wagner, is recovering in a hospital after trying to save his home.\n\nAdding to the chaos, two wildfires started Monday in Southern California's Ventura County area. The Rocky Peak Fire has burned about 20 acres, officials said. The nearby Lynn Fire has scorched about 15 acres. While structures are threatened, firefighters expect to contain that blaze soon, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said.\n\nSearch for missing people continues\n\nAbout 100 people are still unaccounted for statewide, authorities said Monday. Officials are hoping those people are safe elsewhere, but with wildfires still burning, the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nSo far, 42 bodies have been recovered from homes and vehicles in or near Paradise. The Butte County Sheriff's Office identified three of the victims as Ernest Foss, 65, from Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, from Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, from Magalia.\n\nIn Southern California, officials said two deaths in Malibu were related to the Woolsey Fire, bringing the statewide death toll to 44.\n\nButte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory L. Honea said his office is bringing in additional resources to expedite the identification and processing of human remains, including 13 coroner search recovery teams, 150 search and rescue personnel, cadaver dogs, two portable temporary morgue units, and a rapid DNA system.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Chief Brent Newman asked for the public's patience as teams clear affected areas. As part of those efforts, CHP teams removed 60 abandoned cars and set up barriers around dangerous areas. He urged people trying to cross them so they can reach their homes to be patient.\n\n\"It is not a safe environment whatsoever,\" he said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said many residents are anxious to return to their homes or property to take stock of what's left -- herself included.\n\nShe is living in a motor home after losing her house to the Camp Fire. She has a roof and a bed but it won't work for much longer, she said. \"We're thinking about where to go next.\"\n\nShe, too, recalled fleeing her home in her car surrounded by flames so intense that at times she could feel the heat in her car. Trees and telephone poles were up in flames.\n\nWhile the blaze no longer appears to pose a direct threat to Paradise, Jones is concerned about marshaling resources for cleanup and recovery so people can return to what's left of their homes.\n\n\"My biggest concern is do we have the resources to clean up debris and get safety hazards out of the way so people can get to their property ASAP.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Meteorologist debunks Trump on wildfires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/9nX6yhK6kSc/meteorologist-pushes-back-trump-claim-wildfires-sater-sot-nr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

As of Sunday night, the fire had spread to 85,500 acres and was 15% contained.\n\nTogether with the smaller Hill fire, which spans 4,531 acres, the Woolsey fire has so far destroyed 179 structures, but fire officials say another 57,000 are threatened. The Hill fire was 75% contained as of Sunday night.\n\nThe third fire, Northern California's Camp fire, is the most destructive in state history and one of the deadliest . That blaze virtually burned the town of Paradise to the ground, destroying thousands of homes and structures. Some 228 people are unaccounted for.\n\nAt least 31 people have died in the fires: 29 in the Camp fire and two in the Woolsey fire.\n\n'The new abnormal'\n\n\"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal,\" Gov. Jerry Brown said of the role of climate change in driving the fires. \"The chickens are coming home to roost, this is real here.\"\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby echoed Brown's sentiments, noting how widespread the fire destruction has been across the state.\n\nThe southern part of the state used to be able to rely on help from their counterparts up north around this time of the year, Osby said, when the threat of fire was much less prevalent in those communities. But that's no longer the case.\n\n\"And as evident by the Camp Fire in Northern California -- which is larger than this, more structures have been lost than this, more lives have been lost -- it's evident from that situation statewide that we're in climate change and it's going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Osby said.\n\nFirefighters on Sunday contained significant flare-ups in wind-prone canyons along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and Bell Canyon in Ventura County, Osby said.\n\nUnfavorable conditions are expected to persist into Monday, threatening new flare-ups that could reach beyond containment lines, Osby said.\n\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward . That leaves a lot of dry vegetation to feed fires.\n\nOsby urged those in mandatory evacuation zones to leave, warning that they can get in the way of firefighting efforts."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "The astonishing numbers behind these wildfires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/EhjGhSy-ixU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As if the gut-wrenching images weren't powerful enough, the staggering numbers behind the California wildfires show this recent rash of infernos is unlike any other:\n\n44 deaths\n\nOf the 44 people killed in this month's wildfires, 42 died in Northern California's Camp Fire , a record for the most deaths from a California wildfire.

Kyrsten Sinema will win Arizona's US Senate race, defeating Republican Rep. Martha McSally and flipping a seat that had been in GOP hands for 24 years.\n\nMcSally conceded the hard-fought race on Monday night -- six days after the election -- as county-by-county tallies of mailed-in ballots continued to increase Sinema's lead.\n\n\"I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on becoming Arizona's first female senator after a hard-fought battle. I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\" McSally said in a video posted on Twitter Monday night.\n\nCongrats to @kyrstensinema . I wish her success. I'm grateful to all those who supported me in this journey. I'm inspired by Arizonans' spirit and our state's best days are ahead of us. pic.twitter.com/tw0uKgi3oO\n\nThe concession by McSally means the Senate will have 51 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the upcoming Congress. The Senate race in Florida remains undecided and the Mississippi Senate race is going to a runoff later this month.\n\nThe win comes despite President Donald Trump and Republicans pushing false conspiracy theories about why ballots in Arizona were taking so long to count.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday that \"electoral corruption\" was taking place and suggested Arizona should have a new election. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in an email to reporters, accused the Maricopa County recorder of trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nThe reality is about three-fourths of Arizona's ballots are cast by mail. Because of a state law requiring ballots to be sealed and signed, and signatures to match those on voter registration forms, it routinely takes the state longer than most to tally its results.\n\nMcSally's campaign and state-level GOP officials ignored national Republicans' tactics of casting doubt on the election's results.\n\nA shifting Sun Belt\n\nSinema's victory showed that Democrats are continuing to gain momentum in the rapidly diversifying Sun Belt and firmly places Arizona among the most important presidential and Senate battlegrounds.\n\nThe race was certain to deliver Arizona its first female senator. And it came at a time of major change in the state's delegation.\n\nTrump long sought to recruit a Republican to run in the primary against Sen. Jeff Flake, a critic of the President's incendiary rhetoric. At a 2017 rally in Phoenix, Trump huddled backstage with then-state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham and then-Rep. Trent Franks to discuss a potential primary.\n\nRather than face an all-but-certain loss to a Trump-aligned candidate in a primary, Flake retired, opening up the seat on this year's ballot.\n\nThen, in August, longtime GOP Sen. John McCain died. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican former Sen. Jon Kyl to the seat, but Kyl has committed to filling it only through this year -- leaving the possibility that Ducey could have to select another new senator in the coming weeks or months. Either way, McCain's seat is on the ballot in 2020 and is sure to be a top Democratic target.\n\nThe upheaval comes as Arizona, long a Republican bastion, emerges as a swing state in presidential elections. Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by just 4 percentage points there. The result, and the state's growing Latino population, solidified Arizona as a battleground moving forward.\n\nThe fight between McSally and Sinema was bitter, with both drastically shifting their previous positions.\n\nAttempting to prove her conservative bona fides during a primary fight with former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, McSally abandoned her previous support for moderate immigration bills.\n\nSinema's House record ranks her among the most centrist Democrats -- but McSally seized on her rival's past as an anti-war activist, airing a television advertisement featuring Sinema protesting in a pink tutu. McSally told The Arizona Republic that Sinema \"has a lot of explaining to do if you look at her Green Party-pink tutu, proud Prada socialist past and her extreme makeover.\"\n\nLatino Democratic strategists, meanwhile, groused that Sinema had moved too far right on immigration to appeal to a crucial, growing portion of the Democratic electorate.\n\nThe focal point of the contest, though, was health care -- particularly pre-existing conditions. Sinema and Democratic groups lambasted McSally's vote for a House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare, which nonpartisan experts said would weaken the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMcSally responded with advertisements claiming to be \"leading the fight\" to ensure those people are protected -- even though, under Obamacare, they already are, and the fight in Congress was over Republicans' efforts to change those protections."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Florida judge admonishes both sides to 'ramp down the rhetoric' as recount heats up", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/RgDYRP8iyHY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As Republicans seek to cast doubt on the election process in Florida, and Democrats level increasingly heated charges in return, a judge on Monday called on both parties to turn down the temperature.\n\nThe Florida judge overseeing the lawsuit by Republican Senate candidate Gov. Rick Scott against South Florida elections officials warned lawyers on both sides of the fight to cut it out.\n\n\"I am urging, because of the highly public nature of this case, to ramp down the rhetoric. If someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities, they should report it to local law enforcement,\" said Broward County Chief Judge Jack Tuter. \"Everything lawyers are saying out there is being beamed out all over the country.\"\n\nNearly a week after Election Day, Florida politics has been consumed by the recount, with both parties dispatching high-priced lawyers and hordes of volunteers to monitor the laborious process. Much of the focus has been the state's US Senate race, where just over 12,000 votes separate Scott and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. But recounts have also been initiated in the races to be the state's next governor and agriculture commissioner. And the situation has escalated recently, with fiery rhetoric flying from state and national politicians looking to frame the debate as state and county election officials recount votes in offices and nondescript industrial buildings.\n\nRepublicans, including Scott and President Donald Trump, have in recent days alleged that there is \"fraud\" in the election process, despite repeated denials from the Florida Department of State. The Florida state Democratic Party, meanwhile, has compared Scott to a dictator.\n\nThe war of words between Scott's and Nelson's camps has escalated alongside increasingly testy exchanges between demonstrators, all while the clock is ticking toward a Thursday deadline. At the same time, Republicans and Democrats are mounting a furious legal and public relations battle through the media and judicial system.\n\nEven as his race is bogged down in Florida's recount, Scott is planning to travel to the nation's capital this week as part of his transition to the US Senate, according to a senior Scott campaign official.\n\n\"Senator-elect Scott will be traveling to DC this week to participate in some new-member orientation activities, including the photo, and will be voting in leadership elections,\" the official said.\n\nNelson on Monday called on Scott to recuse himself from the recount, saying in a video statement released by his campaign that the governor \"should remove himself from any role in the recount process so the people can have confidence in the integrity of the election.\"\n\nLater Monday, two voting rights groups and a Florida voter made a more official request, asking a federal judge to compel Scott to stand down.\n\nAlleging a \"substantial conflict of interest,\" the League of Women Voters, Common Cause Florida and voter Joanne Lynch Aye filed suit asking for a court to prevent Scott from \"engaging, in his capacity as Governor or using his authority as Governor, in any decisions, directives, control, or influence, either direct or indirect, over the processing and counting of ballots in the 2018 Florida election for U.S. Senate.\"\n\nScott's office did not immediately respond when called for comment.\n\nDeadline looming\n\nAfter election officials spent the weekend casting doubt over whether they would be able to finish the recount by Thursday, there was newfound confidence on Monday in Palm Beach and Broward.\n\nSusan Bucher, supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, told CNN on Sunday that finishing the recount by the Thursday deadline was \"impossible.\" But on Monday, she said she was \"fairly confident\" that the county would be able to meet the deadline for at least the US Senate race. The reason: The older ballot-counting machines in Palm Beach County are able to count only one race at a time, meaning that to do a full recount for the governor's race, election officials will have to redo the process.\n\n\"Right now,\" Bucher said, \"we are just working on the US Senate race.\"\n\nIn Broward, Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections, told reporters that the county intends to meet the Thursday deadline.\n\nThe legal fight\n\nAs volunteers rushed to complete the legally mandated review, Scott again upped the stakes by suing to require law enforcement officials to seize ballots and tallying machines in Broward and Palm Beach counties during any break in the action.\n\nJudge Tuter denied the initial motion in the Broward suit from Scott for an injunction seeking to impound machines and ballots. Instead, under the judge's supervision, the two sides agreed on three additional county deputies to assist the Broward division of elections on its recount. One officer will monitor onsite cameras, a second will monitor storage of USB drives and ballot boxes, and a third will manage the other two officers.\n\nThe suit was part of a larger developing Republican strategy to cast the recount as an opportunity for fraudsters to hijack the election. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was not investigating anything related to the election after the Florida Department of State said there had been no allegations of criminal activity.\n\nScott and Trump have alleged, without evidence, that Democrats were conspiring to overturn the initial results. The President, alleging that \"many ballots are missing or forged,\" tweeted Monday morning that \"an honest vote count is no longer possible,\" and Scott accused Nelson of trying to \"commit fraud to try to win this election.\"\n\n\"No ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from DC will be allowed to steal this election,\" Scott told Fox News on Sunday morning, shortly before he launched a trio of new lawsuits.\n\nFlorida Democrats reacted to Republican legal maneuvering by comparing Scott to a strongman striking out at the infrastructure of the vote.\n\n\"Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\" the state party said in a statement. \"The Governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\"\n\nEugene Pettis, an attorney for controversial Broward elections chief Snipes, responded to the lawsuit by saying she had already secured the facilities.\n\n\"Dr. Snipes has taken multiple measures to make sure that the election machines and ballots are in safekeeping,\" Pettis said.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Pam Bondi is also pushing for increased law enforcement involvement.\n\n\"I fail to see how the Florida Department of Law Enforcement can legitimately refuse to investigate where there is reasonable suspicion that may lead to the discovery of criminal actions in the conduct of the 2018 election,\" she wrote in a Sunday letter to the department, which has pointed to the Department of State's declaration that there is nothing to investigate.\n\nBondi also addressed the Department of State, asking the Republican-appointed secretary to dig deeper and, \"when you find any indication creating a reasonable suspicion of potential criminal activity,\" report it to the law enforcement agency.\n\nSarah Revell, the communications director for the Department of State, replied to Bondi's letter by effectively repeating what the agency has been saying for days.\n\n\"Department staff continues to observe the administration of the election in Broward County,\" Revell said. \"Our staff has not seen any evidence of criminal activity in Broward County at this time.\"\n\nNelson lawsuit\n\nNelson's campaign is also gearing up for a legal challenge that could, perhaps more than any recount, lead to a fundamental shake-up of the race. Its lawsuit, which alleges that the state law requiring that signatures on mail-in ballots match those on record is unconstitutional, will have a hearing in federal court on Wednesday.\n\n\"If we are successful, that will add thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted and we believe have gone uncounted in violation of the US Constitution's guarantee of the right to vote and should be counted,\" Marc Elias, Nelson's top recount lawyer, told reporters on Saturday night, adding: \"We have sought a statewide remedy because we believe that all voters -- whether they voted for Sen. Nelson or for Gov. Scott -- should not be disenfranchised because an election worker doesn't believe that their signature in two different places are closely resembling.\"\n\nMore suits are likely as the week ramps up ahead of the 3 p.m. ET Thursday recount deadline. More would likely follow if a county fails to complete its review.\n\nPalm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett told CNN on Sunday that the county's potential failure to meet the deadline would be \"good news for Republicans because our candidates are ahead.\"\n\n\"If they're not able to meet the deadline, the secretary of state of Florida may go ahead and certify the elections for our candidates,\" Barnett said. \"In that case, you can bet your butt there will be lawsuits filed everywhere.\"\n\nRevell confirmed Barnett's prediction later Sunday, telling CNN that if a county does not submit new figures by Thursday afternoon, \"then the results on file at that time take their place.\"\n\nFlorida governor's race\n\nSunday also marked a return to the spotlight for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who is trailing DeSantis as the recount kicks into gear but revoked his concession a day earlier and plans to aggressively pursue any possible avenue -- including new legal action -- if rumors of unduly uncounted ballots persist.\n\n\"I'm not here to ask for votes. I'm not here to campaign for votes. I'm not here to make a closing argument for what it means to become the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum, who is the mayor of Tallahassee, told supporters in Fort Lauderdale late Sunday. \"I'm simply here to say for the votes that have been cast, they ought to be counted. Every last single one of them.\"\n\nGillum then addressed supporters Monday at St. John Missionary Baptist Church in Boynton Beach, saying of Tuter, \"This is a judge that has said that this is getting out of hand.\"\n\n\"Why is it the case that we've got all this drama, all of these shenanigans, all of these allegations, where in court today the judge said to the governor, and to their attorneys, that they have to ratchet down their rhetoric?\" he said. \"This is a judge. This is a judge that has said that this is getting out of hand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, DeSantis has been very careful with his public posture in the wake of the recount. He has given only one statement, a taped video announcement directed to supporters, and has not held any events or press availabilities. Late Sunday, Scott's official schedule as governor was revised to include a note that he and DeSantis had met. Described officially as a \"meeting with Gov-Elect DeSantis,\" it took place in Naples, where the two discussed the upcoming transition."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Michelle Obama says Melania Trump turned down her offer of help", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/9D_47uRzQpE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) In her new memoir, \"Becoming,\" former first lady Michelle Obama writes a passage explaining how her predecessor, Laura Bush, had extended her help to Obama when she was an incoming first lady, telling her that if Obama needed help, she was \"a phone call away.\"\n\nIn turn, Obama writes she did the same for Melania Trump when it was her turn to occupy the role.

That he chose to run a series of national ads to do so shouldn't be lost on anyone. Bloomberg sees himself as a national figure and has always been desirous of a national platform. That desire, coupled with his party switch (he's a Democrat again) and his massive personal wealth, all suggest that Bloomberg is dead serious about running. The question is whether he -- a white guy from NYC -- is what the party is pining for.\n\n10. Beto O'Rourke: One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has : One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has historically been very skeptical of the now-failed Senate candidate. Sometimes, though, out of the ashes of failure rises success. O'Rourke came the closest for a Texas Democrat to winning a Senate race in a generation. He only lost to Ted Cruz by less than 3 points . O'Rourke did so as an unabashed liberal who inspired millions of Democrats across the country. Importantly, he proved be a tireless worker, which could serve him well on the presidential campaign trail. Still, O'Rourke lost in 2018, was just a three-term member of the House and is man running in a party becoming dominated by women. We're more than just a little skeptical.\n\n9. Sherrod Brown: On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018. He represents a state that President Donald Trump won by 9 points in 2016, and Republicans recruited a credible challenger -- Rep. Jim Renacci -- into the race against him. It didn't work out that way, as Brown cruised to a win even as some of his fellow Democrats in states Trump carried were losing on Tuesday night. : On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018.

The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited : Some politicians are coy about running. The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited Iowa multiple times and New Hampshire as well. But showing signs of running isn't enough to get you on this list. One thing we like about Bullock is he has a lane that doesn't seem overly crowded ... yet. He's the outsider western governor in a party that is becoming more dominated by urbanites. That also means that his natural base within the party is very small. One other problem for Bullock is that most people have no clue who he is. In a crowded field, he may get buried before he ever has a chance to shine.\n\n7. Julian Castro: Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Castro told Rolling Stone recently . \"I have a strong vision for the country.\" Given the rising influence of Hispanic voters within the Democratic coalition and Castro's proven star power -- his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention was a tour de force of political oratory -- he's someone to keep an eye on.\n\n6. Bernie Sanders: The case for Sanders remains as obvious as it ever was.

He came in second in the 2016 presidential primary, maintains a high favorable rating with Democrats and he's quite progressive in a party moving to the left. Yet, it seems like his moment may have passed . Sanders placed a distant second in CNN's October poll on the Democratic primary , despite high name recognition. There's no sign that he has solved his problem of attracting black voters. Additionally, Sanders might be a victim of his own success. There will likely be other Democrats running this time around who are outsiders (such as Bullock) or are very liberal (such as Harris).\n\n5.

On a trip through Iowa (DING) last month to stump for candidates up and down the Hawkeye State ballot (DING DING), he said this: \"This might be the Midwest, I grew up in the Northeast, but folk are folk.\" (DING DING DING). Folk are folk! Booker has been somewhat outshined as the rising star within the changing Democratic Party by Harris, but he is a gifted orator and someone who seems to want it badly. Both of which matter in the grind of a presidential primary.\n\n4. Amy Klobuchar: A lot of people will disagree with putting the Minnesota senator this high on the list, but hear us out. Democrats are desperate to win back the Midwest. If they are, then doesn't it make sense to nominate someone who just won reelection to the Senate from a key Midwestern state by 24 points. It was by far the biggest win for any Democratic Midwestern senator. We're reminded of : A lot of people will disagree with putting the Minnesota senator this high on the list, but hear us out.

It was by far the biggest win for any Democratic Midwestern senator. We're reminded of another Midwestern senator who won his last election before running for president by a wide margin. What does Klobuchar offer the base? She gives them a calm but prosecutorial demeanor that she could use to fight Trump. That served her well during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings . Not being a fire-breathing liberal could hurt her in the primary, however.\n\n3. Joe Biden: Take a poll today in any early voting state like Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina and the former vice president will be on top.

In the final days of the 2018 campaign, Biden, hoarse from shouting, held 12 rallies for Democratic candidates -- uttering classic Bidenisms like \"It's time to get up.

In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 80 confirmed cases of the illness, and 219 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "US has highest rate of drug overdoses, study says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/heqqq5WGIE0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The United States has more than double the rate of premature overdose deaths of at least 12 other countries, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, says that there were an estimated 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 in the US.\n\n\"The U.S. has the highest death rate due to drug overdoses for both men and women (35 deaths in 100,000 men and 20 deaths in 100,000 women) in 2015, more than double those of any other country in our study,\" Yingxi Chen, one of the researchers and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute , wrote in an email.\n\nMexico had the lowest rates: 1 death per 100,000 men and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 women.\n\nThe researchers also found that the United States had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths: 4.3% per year in men and 5.3% per year in women, Chen said.

They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled. But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day.

We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Jury delivers $25.5 million 'statement' to Aetna to change its ways", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7keMng2BA8g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud.

Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml", "title": "California wildfires: At least 42 are killed in deadliest blaze", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46190118", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption California wildfires continue to rage\n\nThirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfire to 42, officials say.\n\nThe remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state.\n\nAt least 228 people are missing, as the Camp Fire continues to rage.

Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk.\n\nThe fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing.\n\nMany more people are said to be unaccounted for.\n\nIn the south of the state, other wildfires continue to rage. The Woolsey Fire has so far claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts, including Malibu.\n\nMore than 300,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across California.\n\nPresident Trump has declared a \"major disaster\" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents.\n\nHow did people die?\n\nParadise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in nearby forest on Thursday.\n\nSome bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The town of Paradise has been obliterated by the blaze\n\nSorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend.\n\n\"I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,\" she told the Newsday programme.\n\n\"It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time.

It is only 10% contained.

That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited\n\nAnd then there's climate change.

Six other militants were killed as well as one of the Israeli special forces soldiers.\n\nThe incident is reported to have happened east of Khan Younis, in the south of the territory.\n\nWhy did Israel kill the commander?\n\nDue to the secrecy of the operation, Israel has not revealed specific details about the mission.\n\nThe IDF said, however, that the operation was \"not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Israel carried out air strikes when Sunday night's firefight erupted\n\nThe BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says that according to a former Israeli general, the incident was likely to have been an intelligence-gathering operation that went wrong.\n\nThe exposure of such an operation by Israeli special forces inside Gaza would be extremely rare, he says.\n\nFawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, denounced Sunday's incident as a \"cowardly Israeli attack\".\n\nWhy are Israel and Hamas enemies?\n\nHamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in the Gaza Strip after ousting West Bank-based Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rival Fatah faction in clashes the following year.\n\nWhile Mr Abbas's umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has signed peace accords with Israel, Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and advocates the use of violence against it.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Schools have been ordered to close in Israeli border communities as a precaution\n\nIsrael, along with Egypt, has maintained a blockade of Gaza since about 2006 in order, they say, to stop attacks by militants.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have gone to war three times, and rocket-fire from Gaza and Israeli air strikes against militant targets are a regular occurrence.\n\nSunday night's incident comes after apparent progress in an Egyptian- and UN-brokered process to mediate after a series of escalations between the two sides in recent months."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Melbourne car attack: James Gargasoulas guilty of six murders", "article_link":

Islamophobia, which he called a \"propaganda word\", raised questions about his suitability.\n\nCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire said his views had been misrepresented.\n\nThe philosopher's character had been \"smeared\", Mr Brokenshire told MPs, saying he was \"uniquely qualified\" for the role because he was a world-leading authority on aesthetics.\n\nOne of the UK's leading public intellectuals and the author of more than 50 books, Sir Roger was named as chairman of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission earlier this month.\n\nThe unpaid appointment has divided opinion, with Labour and Lib Dem MPs saying he is unsuitable because of remarks he has made in the past on social, religious and moral issues.\n\n'Conspiracy theories'\n\nIn an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2007, Sir Roger wrote: \"Every now and then, however, we wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal.\"\n\nIn an interview for online magazine Spiked in 2016, he said: \"Lesbianism is usually an attempt by a woman to find that committed love that she can't get from men any more.\"\n\nIn a 2005 lecture in the United States, he said date rape was not a crime and what \"supposed\" victims were actually saying was: \"'The whole thing went too quickly,' you know, 'I was not prepared,' and so consent is withdrawn as it were in retrospect.\"\n\nSpeaking in Hungary in 2016 on the future of Europe and the nation state, he made remarks about the financier George Soros which one Labour MP has said amounted to \"peddling anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\".\n\n\"Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,\" Sir Roger said.\n\nHe added: \"As the world knows, indigenous anti-Semitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews.\"\n\n'Due diligence'\n\nRaising the appointment in the House of Commons, shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne suggested Sir Roger had made a number of other \"unacceptable\" comments, including \"speaking favourably\" of far-right movements such as the National Front.\n\n\"If we are going to have a society which welcomes free speech, we should hold people to account for what they use that privilege to say,\" he said.\n\nHis Labour colleague Clive Efford said what was at stake was not defending freedom of speech but whether someone who had \"extreme views\" was suitable for a high-profile public role.\n\nBut a succession of Conservative MPs offered their support to Sir Roger, saying the selective quotes cited by his critics were not a proper reflection of his arguments.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg said as a philosopher his role was to \"advance debate and discussion\" on difficult issues, while Bob Seely said the government should not allow itself \"to be bullied by the thought police rent-a-mob\".\n\nMr Brokenshire said \"due diligence\" had been carried out before the appointment and ministers did not have to agree with all Sir Roger's \"strong and controversial views\", some of which he said he had changed his mind on, to recognise the contribution he could make.\n\n\"It saddens me that someone who has done so much to champion freedom of speech, expression and thought should be subject to such misinformed, ill judged and personal attacks we have seen over the last few days.\"\n\nSir Roger has said he is \"offended and hurt\" by suggestions that he is any way anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, insisting \"nothing could be further than the truth\".\n\nIn a statement on his blog last week, he said: \"If people actually read my comments regarding the interplay between George Soros and Hungary, they will realise they are not in any way anti-Semitic, indeed quite the opposite.\n\n\"My statements on Islamic states points only to the failure of these states, which is a

According to Prof Godfray he was \"explicitly asked\" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls.\n\nInstead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007.\n\nNatural boundaries\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nThese showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement.\n\nIt did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed.\n\nSince culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult.\n\nThey say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates.\n\nBut Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile.\n\n\"We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',\" he said.\n\n\"If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved.\"\n\nAnother argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle.\n\n\"It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe report warns however that continued culling \"would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial\" and says that a shift away from culling is \"highly desirable\".\n\nSpecifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination.\n\nTesting regime\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nProf Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed. It therefore urges that Defra adopts more sensitive tests.\n\nThe farming minister welcomed the report and said that Defra would give its response by next summer.\n\n''We welcome this review of the government's 25-year Bovine TB strategy and I extend my thanks to Sir Charles Godfray and his team for their hard work in producing the report.\n\n\"Sir Charles' report is an important contribution that will inform next steps in the strategy to achieve officially TB free status for England by 2038.''\n\nProf Rosie Woodroffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said that the report had many good ideas but said nothing about the effectiveness of the current badger culls.\n\n\"The report contains little critical evaluation of whether the current farmer-led culls are effectively reducing cattle TB,\" she said.\n\n\"It reports results from the first two years of monitoring without mentioning any of the caveats included by the original authors. It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third.\"\n\nProf Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out.\n\n\"Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Mystery monkey: history of unique Xenothrix fossil revealed", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46187670", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The monkey, called the xenothrix, was closely related to the titi monkey which lives in the Amazon\n\nA mysterious extinct monkey from Jamaica that is unlike any other in the fossil record has South American roots, according to new evidence.\n\nDNA extracted from fossilised bones suggests the monkey first colonised the island 11 million years ago.\n\nIt had no predators there and it evolved strange features not seen in living monkeys today.\n\nBut the animal went extinct a few hundred years ago, likely due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\nScientists say the discovery highlights how vulnerable unique island animals are to extinction.\n\n\"It was a really weird animal indeed,\" Prof Samuel Turvey from international conservation charity, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News.\n\n\"Possibly with legs like a rodent; body maybe like a slow loris.

They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market.\n\nThe manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly.\n\nSome water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it doesn't realistically reflect what happens in the sewers.\n\nBut the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked \"flushable\" weren't the problem.\n\nLast year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard.\n\nBut these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.\n\nHear more on Costing The Earth on BBC Radio 4 on 13 November at 15:30 BST, repeated on 14 November at 21:00."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change protests leads to '22 arrests' over blockade", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46172661", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:00:56", "body_paragraphs": "Image caption Protesters lay chained together on the pavement outside the UK government's energy department\n\nEnvironment activists who have blockaded the UK's energy department in London say 22 people have been arrested during the protest.\n\nThe Met Police confirmed at least eight protestors have been detained.\n\nThe UK is seen as a leader in policies to reduce greenhouse gases and will soon be considering tougher targets.\n\nBut the protesters say research suggests the chance of keeping the global temperature rise under a 2C danger threshold is just one in 20.\n\nThe demonstrators blocked entry to the offices by lying chained together on the pavement, while some glued themselves to the doors of the department building.\n\nFurther protests are planned through the week and the demonstrators believe the public will take them seriously, as they are willing to go to jail for their cause.\n\nImage caption Some demonstrators also glued themselves to the door of the building\n\nThey compare themselves with the suffragettes, the anti-apartheid movement, the followers of Gandhi, and the US civil rights movement, although their critics point out that these groups didn't have the vote.\n\nThey have declared Saturday as Extinction Rebellion Day \u2013 the day they\u2019ll commit acts of civil disobedience in the hope of jolting governments round the world into stronger action.\n\nWhy are they happy to be arrested?\n\nImage caption Gail Bradbrook says she wants to protect the planet for her children's sake\n\nOne of the protesters, Gail Bradbrook - a mother of two from Stroud - said: \u201cI want the planet protected for my children.\n\n\u201cChange comes when people are willing to commit acts of peaceful civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cFifty people in jail for a short time is likely to bring the ecological crisis into the public consciousness.\u201d\n\nThe first mass meeting of the organisation last month drew 1,000 people to Westminster and blocked roads for two hours.

And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence.\n\n\"So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up.\n\n\"Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nMr Eustice had said: \"Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.\"\n\nHowever, the APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, \"these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle\".\n\nWeight of science\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nOn 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: \"The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.\"\n\nThe department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset.\n\nDr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.\n\n\"Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.\"\n\nIn response, a Defra statement said: \"The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.\n\n\"Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nDr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed.\n\nOn Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness \"lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation\".\n\nBut two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.\n\nJan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.\n\nShe said: \"Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers.\n\n\"Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.\"\n\nDefra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: \"This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.\"\n\nMedia access\n\nMuch of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey.\n\nDefra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.\n\nA spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFormer Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: \"When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nDefra responded: \"Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.\n\n\"As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "3 More States Vote To Legalize Marijuana", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/3-more-states-vote-to-legalize-marijuana-1830394694", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Voters in Michigan passed a measure Tuesday legalizing pot sales, while Utah and Missouri added themselves to the growing roster of 33 states where medical marijuana is legal.

known as a \"runaway stabilizer\" - was covered by existing procedures.\n\nEven though this problem was - according to investigators - not covered in the operating manual, pilots did have access to a checklist designed to turn off errant systems when the plane started nosing downwards at the wrong time, said Soejono, a Lion Air instructor who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\n\nExperts say investigators will be examining whether the crew examined this checklist and if so whether they had time to cut off the automated nose-down system while flying at a relatively low altitude of 5,000 feet. Pilots on a previous flight are reported to have overcome a similar sensor problem.\n\nTo answer that question fully, investigators may need access to cockpit voice recordings thought to be hidden in the seabed.\n\nA search for the jet's missing cockpit voice recorder is continuing and could provide important information about human factors relating to the crash, Soerjanto said."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema wins Arizona US Senate seat", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/democrat-kyrsten-sinema-wins-arizona-senate-seat-181113055829067.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won Arizona's open US Senate seat in a race that was among the most closely watched in the nation.\n\nSinema beat Republican Martha McSally - a former Air Force pilot who embraced President Donald Trump after opposing him during the 2016 elections - in the battle to replace GOP Senator Jeff Flake.\n\nThe three-term congresswoman won after a slow vote count that dragged on for nearly a week after voters went to the polls on November 6.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Pence, Abe Discuss Trade, North Korea ahead of APEC", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-japan-relations/4656079.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence says a bilateral trade agreement with Japan is the best way to resolve a trade imbalance that Washington says has put U.S. products at a disadvantage.\n\n\"American products and services too often face barriers to compete fairly in Japanese markets,\" Pence said at a joint news conference in Tokyo Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, adding, the \"best opportunity for free, fair and reciprocal trade will come in a bilateral trade agreement.\" He said the two nations will negotiate a trade agreement that will be a \"model\" for other nations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his preference for bilateral deals negotiated on terms more favorable to the United States.\n\nTrump has complained about Japan's $69 billion trade surplus with the United States and has been pressuring Abe to agree to a two-way agreement to address it.

But while 1.5 percent more students studied in the U.S. last year, the rate of new enrollments \u2014 specifically, undergraduate students \u2014 declined by 6.6 percent, a trend first seen the preceding year, according to the Institute for International Education\u2019s (IIE) annual Open Doors report.\n\n\u201cThese relationships are critical in a competitive marketplace,\u201d said Marie Royce, assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, bringing $42 billion and 450,000 jobs to the U.S. economy.\n\nBut tuition costs \u2014 around $20,000 a year for public institutions to more than $70,000 for elite private universities \u2014 make the U.S. look less attractive to international students, as global competition increases, educators said.\n\nSixty-five percent of international students rely on \u201cinternational funding sources\u201d said IIE spokesperson Catherine Morris, \u201cwith well over half of all students (59 percent) funded through their own personal and family funding.\u201d\n\nAmong undergraduates, 82 percent rely on personal and family funding. Most are not eligible for financial aid at U.S. schools.\n\nOver the past 30 years, said Rajika Bhandari, research and strategy senior adviser at IIE, costs increased 213 percent at U.S. public institutions and 130 percent at private U.S. institutions.\n\nForeign countries have taken note and are attracting students with far less expensive tuition and pathways to permanent residency or citizenship.\n\n\u201cThere are real competitive countries out there. It used to be Britain and America,\u201d said Allan Goodman, IIE\u2019s president and former executive dean of Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \u201cGovernments, as part of their international policy, want more students from there and here. The U.S. has real competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada,\u201d said Moninder \"Holly\" Singh, senior director of Arizona State University\u2019s International Students and Scholars Center, \u201cthey\u2019ve done an amazing job at taking the market from us. It doesn\u2019t seem obvious in the U.S. ... They are creating pathways that are simpler than us.\u201d\n\nOnce an international student graduates in Canada, they can get permanent residency status after working for one year. \u201cHere,\u201d Singh said, \u201cwe have people from China and India who might be here 15 years before they can get that.\u201d\n\nPathways to citizenship are important to international students whose home countries have not reached the same quality of life and excellence in education. Many students \u2014 the best and brightest immigrants from their countries \u2014 want to work in the U.S. before returning home. Or they want to stay in the U.S., where freedom, excellence and innovation have been hallmarks of the economy.\n\nChina and India send nearly half of all international students, 363,341 and 196,271, respectively, to the U.S. A currency correction in India two years ago wiped out funding sources for many students there hoping to head to the U.S. And Chinese students, who dominate the population of international students, report growing discontent with paying full tuition next to subsidized domestic students.\n\n\u201cThe current financial model for higher education isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d offered Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities. \u201cWe can\u2019t raise tuitions and have burgeoning loan debts\u201d for international or domestic students.\n\nThe Open Doors report is \u201creally an urgent call for colleges and universities to take a comprehensive look at the way we deliver education,\u201d said AACU\u2019s Pasquerella. \u201cI worry that some institutions are relying on old models and are so tuition-driven, and that we need to look at alternative sources of revenue. It requires us to be innovators.\u201d\n\nIn addition to costs, international students and their families tell educators they are daunted by political rhetoric, feeling unwelcome and wondering if the U.S. is a friendly and safe place to study. The Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies have limited student visas and how they are administered.\n\n\u201cWe became complacent that we\u2019re a preferred destination,\u201d said Robin Lerner, president and CEO of the Texas International Education Consortium, \u201cand we suffered from an over reliance on a number of countries where governments were funding large numbers of students\u201d like Saudi Arabia and Brazil.\n\nHowever, Lerner added, \u201cwhile there are many factors that enter a student\u2019s decision-making, political rhetoric that makes students feel unwelcome or unsafe does not help.\u201d\n\nSafety issues, too, trouble international applicants, educators said, who ask if their children will be safe in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the national news, why, goodness, would you send your child to the U.S.?\u201d Pasquerella asked. \u201cStudents killed in California and in Florida. Who would encourage people to come here under these circumstances?\u201d\n\nAnti-immigrant comments are \u201cinflammatory,\u201d said University of Southern California\u2019s Timothy Brunold, dean of admissions. He said he travels internationally often, speaking with prospective students and their families.\n\n\u201cI am endlessly questioned about this. 'Will my son or daughter be welcomed in the United States? Will they get a visa, but will it be taken away? Will there be an opportunity to work in the U.S. Or will there be a limit?'\u201d Brunold said.\n\n\u201cYes, we are hearing that, too,\u201d said University of Colorado-Boulder's Natalie Koster Mikulak, associate director of international admissions.\n\nThe uncertainty and future of American immigration policy daunts some students, who worry about how and how quickly visa regulations will change. Going home for a family event \u2014 like a relative\u2019s illness or a celebration \u2014 is sometimes skipped for fear of leaving the country.\n\nWhile experts said the dip in new enrollments can be attributed to a mixture of factors, the slide in numbers coincides with the so-called travel ban that limited immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries in early 2017. When ordered, President Donald Trump said it was a national security measure.\n\nThe orders had a chilling effect on international student enthusiasm for the U.S., experts said. If a student\u2019s visa is rescinded before graduation, they might have to start over in another country.\n\nEducators pushed back.\n\n\u201cIt is vital to our economy and the national interest that we continue to attract the best students, scientists, engineers and scholars,\u201d the Association of American Universities stated in a January 2017. \u201cThat is why we have worked closely with previous administrations, especially in the wake of 9/11, to ensure our visa system prevents entry by those who wish to harm us, while maintaining the inflow of talent that has contributed so much to our nation.\u201d\n\nNearly two years later, the U.S. limits student and exchange visas only to Syria and North Korea, said Laura Stein, visa policy analyst at the Bureau of Consular Affairs last week. Stein said applicants from those countries may apply for a waiver from the presidential proclamation. As of Oct. 31, 2018, she said, 2,072 waivers have been granted.\n\nNational security, educators said, is built on sharing American democracy and standards with international students who will carry that positive relationship with them throughout their lives.\n\n\u201cWe see time and time again that non-U.S. students come back,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cThey send their kids here. \u2026 It pays dividends. We need more diplomats.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternational students studying alongside Americans are a tremendous asset to the United States,\u201d Royce said. \u201cWe need to develop leaders in all fields who can take on our toughest challenges. We need people who can find solutions that keep us secure and make us more prosperous. We want to send a message that international education makes us stronger as a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may have been the undisputed leader in the world,\u201d said Brunold. \u201cWe might be starting to see some cracks in that.\u201d\n\nPlease share your thoughts in the Comments here, and visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Acting AG Will Consult With Ethics Officials on Possible Recusals", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-acting-ag-will-consult-with-ethics-officials-on-possible-recusals/4656014.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will consult with ethics officials about any matters that could require him to recuse himself, the Justice Department said on Monday, after critics called on him to step aside from overseeing a Special Counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\"Acting AG Matt Whitaker is fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal,\" spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.\n\nWhitaker became the acting attorney general last week after President Donald Trump ordered Jeff Sessions to resign following months of criticizing him for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump has repeatedly called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nSessions' recusal paved the way for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017.\n\nThe investigation has already led to criminal charges against dozens of people, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nWith Whitaker's appointment, Rosenstein is no longer in charge of the Russia probe.

More remarkably for a freshman member of Congress, she landed a seat on the Rules Committee, which sets the terms for floor debate on legislation.\n\n\n\n\"That kind of is an indication that she has a constituency within the Republican conference \u2014 that she would be considered knowledgeable on issues, someone who is going to help advance the party's leadership agenda,\" said University of Wyoming political science professor Jim King.\n\n\n\nThe Republican conference chairmanship will be especially important now that Republicans look to rebrand themselves after losing the House majority, or at least improve their messaging to voters.\n\n\n\nDeregulation, such as rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law, and federal income tax cuts are important accomplishments that Republicans can sell to voters, Cheney said.\n\n\n\n\"I think now the American people will have a chance to compare what we accomplished and what the Democrats do now that they're in the majority,\" Cheney said.\n\n\n\nCheney would give a fresh face to the party in the No. 3 role. The top two jobs will likely by filled by Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who are already in leadership. Yet having the Cheney brand at the forefront of the GOP communications apparatus could set a mixed tone.\n\n\n\nCheney's ascent will likely prove popular with GOP voters who recall fondly the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney years, especially those who favor a hawkish defense posture.\n\n\n\nAnd as a woman in leadership, she'll face questions about what Republicans acknowledge is a yawning gender gap as their side of the aisle is made up of mostly white men. After the midterm elections, the ranks of Republican women in the House declined.\n\n\n\nLess certain is whether Cheney's style will appeal to those voters in suburban districts, particularly women, who flipped Republican-held seats to Democrats this year. Republicans will need those voters if they hope to win back the House majority in 2020.\n\n\n\nCheney has seen little notoriety lately compared with five years ago, when she launched an ill-fated campaign to oust Wyoming's popular Republican senior senator, Mike Enzi. Labeled a carpet-bagger for having moved to Wyoming from Virginia barely a year earlier, Cheney made things worse by publicly feuding with her openly gay sister about gay marriage.\n\n\n\nShe bowed out eight months before the primary but didn't give up on politics. She continued touring Wyoming, forming \u2014 and in some cases mending \u2014 the relationships she needed to dominate a crowded U.S. House primary two years later.\n\n\n\nHer past experience as a Fox News commentator and State Department employee now give her valuable media and policy experience for the conference chairman job, Cheney said.\n\n\n\n\"It's an opportunity that's going to be focused on what it takes to get the majority back,\" she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "No 'Blue Wave,' But Democrats' Midterm Success Sinking In", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-midterm-success-sinking-in/4656004.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "No, it wasn't a blue wave. But a week after the voting, Democrats are riding higher than they thought on election night.\n\nAs vote counting presses on in several states, the Democrats have steadily chalked up victories across the country, firming up their grip on the U.S. House of Representatives and statehouses. The slow roll of wins has given the party plenty to celebrate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to claim victory for his party on election night. But the Democrats, who hit political rock bottom just two years ago, have now picked up at least 32 seats in the House \u2014 and lead in four more \u2014 in addition to flipping 7 governorships and 8 state legislative chambers. They are on track to lose perhaps two seats in the Senate in a year both parties predicted more.\n\nIn fact, the overall results in the first nationwide election of the Trump presidency represent the Democratic Party's best midterm performance since Watergate.\n\n\"Over the last week we've moved from relief at winning the House to rejoicing at a genuine wave of diverse, progressive and inspiring Democrats winning office,\" said Ben Wikler, Washington director of the liberal group MoveOn.\n\nThe blue shift alters the trajectory of Trump's next two years in the White House, breaking up the Republican monopoly in Washington. It also gives Democrats stronger footing in key states ahead of the next presidential race and in the redrawing of congressional districts \u2014 a complicated process that has been dominated by the GOP, which has drawn favorable boundaries for their candidates.\n\nTrump and his allies discounted the Democratic victories on Monday, pointing to GOP successes in Republican-leaning states.\n\n\"Thanks to the grassroots support for (at)realDonaldTrump and our party's ground game, we were able to (hash)DefyHistory and make gains in the Senate!\" Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel tweeted, citing Senate wins in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee, among others.\n\nIndeed, just once in the past three decades had a sitting president added Senate seats in his first midterm election. But lost in McDaniel's assessment was the difficult 2018 Senate landscape for Democrats, who were defending 10 seats in states Trump carried just two years ago.\n\nSays Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez: \"I believe in facts. And the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party had a historic night at the ballot box \u2014 and we are not resting,\"\n\nPerez said in an interview, \"Our goal was to compete everywhere, to expand and re-shape the electorate everywhere \u2014 and that's exactly what we've done.\"\n\nHistoric diversity\n\nThe Democrats found success by attracting support from women, minorities and college-educated voters. Overall, 50 percent of white college-educated voters and 56 percent of women backed Democrats nationwide, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.\n\nDemocrats featured historic diversity on the ballot.\n\nTheir winning class includes Massachusetts' first African-American female member of Congress, Ayanna Pressley, and Michigan's Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar, the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, along with Kansas' Sharice Davids, the first lesbian Native American.\n\nThey also won by running candidates with military backgrounds who openly embraced gun ownership, such as Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb and Maine's Jared Golden, who is poised to win his contest because of the state's ranked-choice voting system.\n\nThe Democrats needed to gain 23 seats to seize the House majority. Once all the votes are counted, which could take weeks in some cases as absentees and provisional ballots are tallied, they could win close to 40.\n\nDemocrats have not lost a single House incumbent so far. Yet they defeated Republican targets such as Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Dana Rohrabacher of California.\n\nThey could win as many as 19 House races in districts carried by Trump two years ago, according to House Democrats' campaign arm.\n\nTen House races remained too close for the AP to call as of Monday evening.\n\nFar more of the Senate landscape was decided early, although contests in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi remain outstanding.\n\nRepublican control\n\nWhile there were notable statehouse Democratic losses in Iowa and Ohio, the party flipped governorships in seven states: Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Kansas, New Mexico and Maine.\n\nRepublicans now control 25 governorships nationwide compared to 23 for Democrats. High-profile contests in Florida and Georgia remain outstanding, although Republicans hold narrow leads in both states.\n\nOvershadowed perhaps by the higher-profile statewide elections, Democratic gains in state legislatures could prove deeply consequential.\n\nOverall, they flipped state legislative chambers in eight states this midterm season, including Washington state's Senate in 2017. The others include the state Senates in Maine, Colorado, New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut in addition to the state Houses of Representatives in New Hampshire and Minnesota.\n\nWith hundreds of races still too close to call, Democrats have gained at least 370 state legislative seats nationwide, according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. The pickups include surprises in West Virginia, where Democrats knocked off the GOP majority leader-designate in the House and the majority leader in the Senate.\n\n\"We have elected a new generation of inspiring leaders and we know that a new era of democratic dominance is on the horizon,\" said the committee's executive director Jessica Post.\n\nStill, Republicans will control the majority of state legislative chambers, governorships, the U.S. Senate and the White House. And even before the new Democrats take office, attention has begun to shift toward 2020.\n\nMany Democrats have yet to shake off the stinging losses of 2016. Publicly and privately, Democrats are lining up for the chance to take down Trump in two years.\n\n\"This is step one of a two-step process to right the ship,\" Guy Cecil, chairman of the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, said of the midterms. \"Democrats have every reason to be optimistic.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Roger Stone Associate Expects to Be Charged in Mueller Probe", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/roger-stone-associate-expects-to-be-charged-in-mueller-probe/4655997.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "An associate of longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone said Monday that he expects to face charges in the special counsel's Russia investigation.\n\n\n\nConservative conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi said on his YouTube show that negotiations fell apart with special counsel Robert Mueller's team and he expects in the coming days to be charged with making false statements.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm Corsi's claims that charges against him are forthcoming.

Martha McSally in the battle to replace GOP Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\n\n\nThe three-term congresswoman won after a slow vote count that dragged on for nearly a week after voters went to the polls on Nov. 6. She becomes Arizona's first Democratic U.S. senator since 1994. Her win cemented Arizona as a swing state after years of Republican dominance.\n\n\n\nSinema portrayed herself as a moderate who works across the aisle to get things done.\n\n\n\nMcSally, a former Air Force pilot who embraced President Donald Trump after opposing him during the 2016 elections, had claimed that Sinema's anti-war protests 15 years ago disqualified her and said one protest amounted to what she called ``treason.''\n\n\n\nBut during her six years in Congress, Sinema built one of most centrist records in the Democratic caucus, and she voted for bills backed by Trump more than 60 percent of the time. She backed legislation increasing penalties against people in the country illegally who commit crimes.\n\nMcSally's attacks on Sinema reached back more than 15 years, when Sinema was a Green Party spokeswoman and liberal activist.\n\n\n\nMcSally backed Trump's tax cut, border security and the Affordable Care Act repeal agenda as she survived a three-way GOP primary in August, defeating two conservative challengers who claimed her support for Trump was fake. McSally also campaigned on her military record and support for the Armed Forces.\n\n\n\nSinema attacked McSally's leadership of last year's failed Affordable Care Act repeal effort as a sign that she would not protect Arizona residents with preexisting medical conditions. McSally argued that she would protect patients, despite her vote on the bill that would have removed many of those protections.\n\n\n\nThe contest drew more than $90 million in spending, including more than $58 million by outside groups, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Attack ads by both sides clogged the airwaves for months.\n\n\n\nSinema, 42, has a law degree, worked as a social worker and was a political activist in her 20s, running as an independent Green Party candidate for the Arizona House. She then became a Democrat and served several terms in the state Legislature. Sinema started as an overt liberal but developed a reputation for compromise among her Republican peers, laying the groundwork to tack to the center.\n\n\n\nWhen the 9th Congressional District was created after the 2010 Census, Sinema ran for the Phoenix-area seat as a centrist and won the 2012 election.\n\n\n\nMcSally, 52, was the first female Air Force pilot to fly in combat, flying A-10 attack jets. She also was the first woman to command a fighter squadron, again in A-10s.\n\n\n\nMcSally lost her first race in Arizona's 2nd congressional district in 2012, when she was narrowly defeated by Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, who replaced Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt. But McSally came back to win the 2014 election, beating Barber by a narrow margin. She was re-elected in 2016.\n\n\n\nFlake was an outspoken critic of Trump and announced in 2017 that he would not seek re-election, acknowledging he could not win a GOP primary in the current political climate. His support of the president's initiatives, however, was mixed. He strongly backed last year's tax cut bill but criticized Trump's positions on free trade."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Ocean Shock: Menus for\u00a0a Warming Planet", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ocean-shock-menus-for-warming-planet/4656007.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "This is part of \"Ocean Shock,\" a Reuters series exploring climate change's impact on sea creatures and the people who depend on them.\n\nThis series has explored the damaging effects of warming waters in the world's oceans on marine life \u2014 and human life. Stressed by this climate change hidden beneath the waves, fish and other marine species are facing enormous disruption.\n\nWhat can you do to try to lighten your effect on these animals? We talked to five people intimately involved with the sea: a Norwegian seafood chef with a locavore emphasis; an explorer fighting to ban fishing in two-thirds of the world's oceans; an environmental scientist concerned about the global boom in aquaculture; an entrepreneur training unemployed young people as \"sea rangers\" to protect marine reserves; and a New England sushi chef who focuses on invasive species.\n\nChristopher Haatuft, chef\n\nSlapping a 13-pound halibut as long his arm on his restaurant counter, Christopher Haatuft slips the tip of his knife in near the gills, then runs the blade tailward to slice off a fillet.\n\nThe snow-white flesh and its delicate texture are a favorite among customers at his Lysverket restaurant in the Norwegian port of Bergen, where Haatuft and fellow \"Neo-Nordic\" chefs are reimagining Scandinavian cuisine.\n\n\n\nBut Haatuft isn't merely concerned with the flavor. He also knows exactly where the halibut was raised: the Glitne farm on a fjord north of the city, which uses land-based tanks to avoid discharging fish waste into the sea.\n\n\"I like using it because it's a progressive way of farming fish,\" said Haatuft, whose arms are emblazoned with tattoos dating to younger days in the punk rock scene. \"I think chefs are starting to get very conscious about where the fish is coming from, and they want to make sure they represent the restaurant well by having sustainable fish.\"\n\nHis latest goal is to persuade langoustine fishermen to sell him the octopuses that stray into their traps instead of killing them and throwing them back.\n\n\"I would love to see the fishing industry at least branch out from the industrialization that's been going on into more artisanal, boutique types of suppliers,\" Haatuft said. \"There's no doubt in my mind that five to 10 years from now, you'll have more specialized wholesale fish suppliers that don't necessarily do mass market, but they do line-caught, very easily traceable fish.\"\n\nEnric Sala, marine ecologist\n\nEnric Sala is fighting for one of the most ambitious goals in the history of conservation: to turn almost two-thirds of the oceans into a marine reserve.\n\nSound like wishful thinking? Sala and his team, working with partners around the world, have persuaded governments to create 19 protected areas in the decade since they launched the Pristine Seas project, which the National Geographic Society calls its largest initiative dedicated to environmental preservation. Added together, these new parks cover waters equivalent to half the size of Canada.\n\nSala believes that the quickest way to begin to buffer the oceans against the effects of climate change would be by banning fishing on the high seas \u2014 the maritime no man's land not under any country's jurisdiction that covers almost half the surface of the Earth.\n\n\"We are in a planetary emergency: Global warming and acidification are going to damage ocean life in a way that we have never seen before,\" said Sala, a former professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \"The science is clear, the economics are clear: Protecting the high seas could be the lowest hanging fruit for ocean conservation.\"\n\n\"It's easy to be depressed, but we should be enraged,\" he said. \"We need to redirect this anger, this energy, into positive action.\"\n\nJennifer Jacquet, environmental scientist\n\nMajestic orcas, playful dolphins and gimlet-eyed great whites: These creatures have all cast their spell on generations of ocean lovers.\n\nThe cockles, mussels and clams feeding unobtrusively on the seabed don't tend to ignite quite so much excitement. Jennifer Jacquet believes it's time they did.\n\nJacquet, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at New York University, believes that bivalves could hold the key to reducing pressure on ocean life under siege from fast-accelerating climate change.\n\nHer logic is simple: A global boom in the aquaculture industry is placing an unsustainable burden on the oceans by using vast quantities of wild-caught fish to feed salmon and other farmed carnivores. If the industry switched away from farming carnivorous fish and produced low-impact shellfish and seaweed instead, it would do a lot to ease the pressure, she argues.\n\n\"Our argument is that we need to farm lower on the food web,\" Jacquet said. \"We need to rethink what aquaculture is and will be in the future. Otherwise, it will remain part of the problem \u2014 and the worst part is, people think it's part of the solution.\"\n\nWietse van der Werf, entrepreneur\n\nIt's one of the big wins for environmentalists of the past decade: Governments in many parts of the world have created new marine reserves to protect ocean life. But Wietse van der Werf, who spent years campaigning against illegal fishing in the Mediterranean and North Africa, fears these victories will amount to little if no one is there to keep out the poachers.\n\nA Dutch environmental-activist-turned social-entrepreneur, Van der Werf believes he's found a solution: hire veterans from the navy and marines to train unemployed young people as \"sea rangers\" to patrol areas that governments don't have the resources to cover.\n\n\"The danger is that the legacy that we leave behind as a conservation movement is merely one on paper and it doesn't actually mean anything,\" Van der Werf said. \"The question is: How are you going to monitor these areas?\"\n\nWith backers including a foundation set up by former Google exec Eric Schmidt, his Sea Ranger Service works like this: Young people struggling with long-term unemployment apply for free training as maritime professionals. Applicants attend a five-week \"boot camp\" where one in four is selected to undergo months of training at sea. Once qualified, the crews then, for a fee, perform a wide range of tasks for government agencies, companies and research institutes.\n\nThe first team of 12 Sea Rangers is preparing to set sail next month in the North Sea.\n\n\"The maritime domain is changing very fast,\" Van der Werf said. \"If we're talking about growing food offshore, if we're talking about the energy transition, there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nBun Lai, chef\n\nChef Bun Lai had just cooked a meal of fried inch-long silverside fish and tiny invasive Asian shore crabs along with tempura wakame seaweed, all of which he had harvested from the nearby Long Island Sound earlier in the day. He was sitting at his dining room table, smoking a cigarette.\n\nIt was a jarring contradiction for a man whose restaurant, Miya's Sushi, is renowned for its heart-healthy sushi creations, often made with invasive species of marine life and seaweed as well as weeds scavenged from his overgrown garden. But Lai is a bundle of energetic contradictions.\n\nHe bills his restaurant, a few blocks from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, as the first sustainable sushi restaurant on Earth.\n\nThe menu includes invasive wild boar from Texas, a roll called sushi salaam dedicated to a \"world without violence and retribution,\" as well as a dish with dried crickets emerging from rice.\n\n\"This is our climate-change dish,\" he said. He had formed a six-inch-wide puck of frozen seawater from the Sound. It was mixed with invasive seaweed, also from the Sound, and salt from the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, which is struggling to stay above the rising sea levels. He placed the puck atop a water jug with a candle at the bottom. The puck glowed and cast green shadows onto a thinly sliced island of invasive lionfish.\n\nLionfish is native to Kiribati, Bun said, but the fish he serves was caught in Mexico. After being released into the wild by aquarium owners, the Pacific fish has spread to the U.S. Southeast and throughout the Caribbean. Without any natural predators, it is crowding out many native species.\n\nTo him, serving the lionfish speaks to eating animals and plants in concert with what nature provides rather than forcing nature to provide what we want."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Greater Paris to Ban Old Diesel Cars From Summer 2019", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/greater-paris-to-ban-old-diesel-cars-from-summer-2019/4655978.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "The Greater Paris region will become a low-emission zone from next summer, which will limit the circulation of old diesel cars, the regional authority decided on Monday.\n\nThe Metropole du Grand Paris council said on its Twitter feed it had voted to ban diesel cars registered before Dec. 31, 2000 from the area within the A86 second ring-road, which includes Paris and 79 municipalities around it, a region with 5.61 million inhabitants.\n\nThe ban will use France's new \"Crit'Air\" vignette system, which identifies cars' age and pollution level with color-coded stickers.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nThe death toll from the wildfire that incinerated the town of Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 29, matching the mark for the deadliest single blaze in California history. Statewide, the number of fire dead stood at 31, including two victims in Southern California.\n\nOne reason that scientists know that management isn't to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren't \"fuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\" Dennison said.\n\nIn those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.\n\n\"It's not about forest management. These aren't forests,\" he said.\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles (34,200 square kilometers) have burned. That's more than a third higher than the 10-year average.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1999, the United States didn't reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 11 of 19 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including this year. In 2006, 2015 and 2017, more than 15,000 square miles burned.\n\nThe two fires now burning \"aren't that far out of line with the fires we've seen in these areas in recent decades,\" Dennison said.\n\n\"The biggest factor was wind,\" Dennison said in an email. \"With wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.\"\n\nThese winds, called Santa Ana winds, and the unique geography of high mountains and deep valleys act like chimneys, fortifying the fires, Thornicke said.\n\nThe wind is so strong that fire breaks - areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel - won't work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet (43 meters), Dennison said.\n\nSouthern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but \"the difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,\" Dennison said.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, Thornicke said.\n\nAnd it's more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called \"ladder fuel,\" offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that's a problem, he said.\n\nLocal and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that's not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.\n\nUniversity of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.\n\nIt's simple, he said: \"The warmer it is, the more fire we see.\"\n\nFor every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.\n\nFederal fire and weather data show the years with the most acres burned were generally a degree warmer than average.\n\n\"Everyone who has gardened knows that you must water more on hotter days,\" Overpeck said. \"But, thanks in part to climate change, California isn't getting enough snow and rain to compensate for the unrelenting warming caused by climate change. The result is a worsening wildfire problem."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "More Women in Poor Countries Use Contraception, Says Report", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/more-women-in-poor-countries-use-contraception-says-report/4655434.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "More women and girls in poor countries are using modern contraception, signifying progress in efforts to involve women in family planning, according to a report released Monday.\n\nThe number of women and girls using contraceptives in 69 of the world's poorest countries surpassed 317 million in 2018, representing 46 million more users than in 2012, said the report by Family Planning 2020, a U.N.-backed global advocacy group working to promote rights-based family planning.\n\nAccess to modern contraception helped prevent over 119 million unintended pregnancies and averted 20 million unsafe abortions between July 2017 and July 2018, although populations continue to soar across Africa and other low-income countries, the report said.\n\n\"The best way to overcome this challenge of rapid population growth is by giving women and girls [the] opportunity to decide how many children they want to have,\" Beth Schlachter, executive director of Family Planning 2020, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe mix of contraceptive methods has improved significantly in 20 of the surveyed countries, \"meaning that more women are able to find the short-term, long-acting, emergency, or permanent method that suits their needs and preferences,\" the report said.\n\nBut even as millions of poor women use contraceptives, millions more who want to delay or prevent pregnancy are still unable to access it, often due to lack of information, the report said, citing perceived health side-effects and social disapproval as deterrents.\n\nUnder Family Planning 2020, which grew out of a summit on family planning held in London in 2012, donors have pledged millions of dollars to bring contraception to 120 million more women and girls in developing countries by the year 2020.\n\nMany of the 69 countries surveyed for the report are in sub-Saharan Africa, which is witnessing a population boom even as other parts of the world see dropping birth rates. Over half of the global population growth between now and 2050 will take place in Africa, according to U.N. figures.\n\nAccording to the new report, contraceptive use is growing fastest in Africa, even though the region's fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe most recent U.N. global population report estimates Africa's fertility rate to be 5.1 births per woman.\n\nBecause the region's growing population is not backed by substantial rises in family incomes and the development of public infrastructure, there are concerns that a population boom may deepen poverty levels for many Africans.\n\nOver the years, family planning has often been difficult to sell in heavily paternalistic sub-Saharan Africa, with the matter becoming controversial as some African leaders challenge the view that a growing population is bad for the world's poorest continent.\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni insists Africa needs more people, and has lambasted what he calls \"the shrill cries of NGOs about population control.\"\n\nIn February, President John Magufuli of Tanzania encouraged polygamy, citing the 10 million more women than men in his country in advising men to marry \"two or more wives\" to reduce the number of single women."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Scientists to Swap Dusty Old Kilogram for Something More Stable", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-to-swap-dusty-old-kilogram-for-something-more-stable/4655398.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "After years of nursing a sometimes dusty cylinder of metal in a vault outside Paris as the global reference for modern mass, scientists are updating the definition of the kilogram.\n\nJust as the redefinition of the second in 1967 helped to ease communication across the world via technologies like GPS and the internet, experts say the change in the kilogram will be better for technology, retail and health \u2014 though it probably won't change the price of fish much.\n\nThe kilogram has been defined since 1889 by a shiny piece of platinum-iridium held in Paris. All modern mass measurements are traceable back to it \u2014 from micrograms of pharmaceutical medicines to kilos of apples and pears and tons of steel or cement.\n\nThe problem is, the \"international prototype kilogram\" doesn't always weigh the same.

But the whole process of cleaning or handling or using the mass can change its mass. So it's not the best way, perhaps, of defining mass.\"\n\nWhat's needed is something more constant.\n\nSo, at the end of a week-long meeting in the Palace of Versailles, Paris, the world's leading measurement aficionados at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures will vote Friday to make an \"electronic kilogram\" the new baseline measure of mass.\n\nJust as the meter \u2014 once the length of a bar of platinum-iridium, also kept in Paris \u2014 is now defined by the constant speed of light in a vacuum, so a kilogram will be defined by a tiny but immutable fundamental value called the \"Planck constant.\"\n\nThe new definition involves an apparatus called the Kibble balance, which makes use of the constant to measure the mass of an object using a precisely measured electromagnetic force.\n\n\"In the present system, you have to relate small masses to large masses by subdivision. That's very difficult \u2014 and the uncertainties build up very, very quickly,\" Robinson said.\n\n\"One of the things this [new] technique allows us to do is to actually measure mass directly at whatever scale we like, and that's a big step forward.\"\n\nHe said it had taken years of work to fine-tune the new definition to ensure the switchover will be smooth.\n\nBut while the extra accuracy will be a boon to scientists, Robinson said that, for the average consumer buying flour or bananas, \"there will be absolutely no change whatsoever.\""}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Media: German States Want Social Media Law Tightened", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/media-german-states-want-social-media-law-tightened/4655990.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "German states have drafted a list of demands aimed at tightening a law that requires social media companies like Facebook and Twitter to remove hate speech from their sites, the Handelblatt newspaper reported Monday.\n\nJustice ministers from the states will submit their proposed revisions to the German law called NetzDG at a meeting with Justice Minister Katarina Barley on Thursday, the newspaper said, saying it had obtained a draft of the document.\n\nThe law, which came into full force on Jan. 1, is a highly ambitious effort to control what appears on social media and it has drawn a range of criticism.\n\nWhile the German states are focused on concerns about how complaints are processed, other officials have called for changes following criticism that too much content was being blocked.\n\nThe states' justice ministers are calling for changes that would make it easier for people who want to complain about banned content such as pro-Nazi ideology to find the required forms on social media platforms.\n\nThey also want to fine social media companies up to 500,000 euros ($560,950) for providing \"meaningless replies\" to queries from law enforcement authorities, the newspaper said.\n\nTill Steffen, the top justice official in Hamburg and a member of the Greens party, told the newspaper that the law had in some cases proven to be \"a paper tiger.\"\n\n\"If we want to effectively limit hate and incitement on the internet, we have to give the law more bite and close the loopholes,\" he told the paper. \"For instance, it cannot be the case that some platforms hide their complaint forms so that no one can find them.\"\n\nFacebook in July said it had deleted hundreds of offensive posts since implementation of the law, which foresees fines of up to 50 million euros ($56.10 million) for failure to comply."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "France to 'Embed' Regulators at Facebook to Combat Hate Speech", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/france-to-embed-regulators-facebook-combat-hate-speech/4655366.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook will allow French regulators to \"embed\" inside the company to examine how it combats online hate speech, the first time the wary tech giant has opened its doors in such a way, President Emmanuel Macron said Monday.\n\nFrom January, Macron's administration will send a small team of senior civil servants to the company for six months to verify Facebook's goodwill and determine whether its checks on racist, sexist or hate-fueled speech could be improved.\n\n\"It's a first,\" Macron told the annual Internet Governance Forum in Paris. \"I'm delighted by this very innovative experimental approach,\" he said. \"It's an experiment, but a very important first step in my view.\"\n\nThe trial project is an example of what Macron has called \"smart regulation,\" something he wants to extend to other tech leaders such as Google, Apple and Amazon.\n\nThe move follows a meeting with Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg in May, when Macron invited the CEOs of some of the biggest tech firms to Paris, telling them they should work for the common good.\n\nThe officials may be seconded from the telecoms regulator and the interior and justice ministries, a government source said.

That term, ecologically valid, means that the research attempts to mimic real life.\n\nThe study divided the participants into two groups: The first group was allowed to maintain their normal social media habits. The other, the control group, was restricted to 10 minutes per day on each of the three platforms: Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe restrictions were put in place for three weeks and then the participants returned and were tested for outcomes such as fear of missing out (FOMO), anxiety, depression and loneliness.\n\n\u200bResults of study\n\nThe results showed a very clear link between social media use and increased levels of depression and loneliness.\n\n\u201cUsing less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese effects are particularly pronounced for folks who were more depressed when they came into the study.\u201d\n\nShe calls her findings the \u201cgrand irony\u201d of social media.\n\nWhat is it about social media that\u2019s just so depressing?\n\nHunt says that it\u2019s two major things. The first is that social media invites what Hunt calls \u201cdownward social comparison.\u201d When you\u2019re online, it can sometimes seem that \u201ceveryone else is cooler and having more fun and included in more things and you\u2019re left out,\u201d she said.

But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said. But she expects her results should generalize at least for people through the age of 30.\n\nHunt says she is now beginning a study to gauge the emotional impact of dating apps."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "For Autistic Kids, Robots Can Be Social, Learning Study Buddy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/for-autistic-kids-robots-can-be-social-skills-learning-study-buddy/4652742.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "Robots have been put to work assembling cars in factories, answering questions at conventions and hotel lobbies, moving packages in warehouses, and more.

And cell towers are still down.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201congoing process\u201d to find those that are still alive, McLean noted.

Some people have gone to stay with friends nearby, others to hotels, and others to neighboring Nevada to \u201cjust to get their head back on,\u201d McLean said.\n\n\u201cThe fire spread the length of a football field in the matter of a second or two,\u201d he added.\n\nAs of Monday, the Camp fire was only 30 percent contained and the Woolsey fire was only 20 percent contained and had spurred mandatory evacuations for the entire city of Malibu and other nearby communities.\n\nFor those whose loved ones are still missing, law enforcement has been referring people to the Red Cross\u2019 Safe and Well website \u2015 a free tool for individuals to post messages saying they are safe or to search for names.

By Monday, the nearly 1 million remaining ballots were finally counted, and Sinema emerged on top.\n\nIn a victory speech on Monday evening, Sinema framed her win as a move away from \u201cpetty\u201d politics.\n\n\u201cArizona proved there\u2019s a better way forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can work with people that are different than us ...

McSally is a retired Air Force colonel and was the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat.\n\nThe race for the Senate seat was exceptionally close and was viewed as crucial to Democrats\u2019 chances of taking back the U.S. Senate, but losses for a handful of Democratic incumbents ended that possibility. Arizona is a former Republican bastion \u2015 home to Barry Goldwater, the founder of the modern conservative movement \u2015 that has slowly emerged as a swing state in recent years, due in part to a steady rise in Latino voters.\n\nThe contest largely centered on health care, an issue of primary importance particularly to the more than 1 million Arizonans who have a pre-existing health condition. In the lead-up to the midterm election, Sinema and Democratic groups emphasized McSally\u2019s votes to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act. McSally\u2019s campaign approach was primarily to turn voters\u2019 attention to Sinema\u2019s past and ideology, especially her activism against the Iraq War.\n\nEven with Sinema\u2019s win, Republicans will still hold control of the Senate but at a slightly smaller margin. Several other races remain up in the air. Florida\u2019s Senate race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat incumbent Bill Nelson is approaching a recount deadline on Thursday. The Senate race in Mississippi advanced to a runoff after neither Republican Sen.

Must go with Election Night!\u201d\n\nScott and DeSantis are the GOP\u2019s candidates for U.S. senator and governor in Florida whose election-night margins of victory have resulted in legally mandated recounts.\n\nBut skipping those recounts would not only violate state law, it would ignore the ballots of tens of thousands of Florida-based troops deployed overseas. Those ballots are supposed to be counted if they arrive by this coming Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice commentary from the commander-in-chief on Veterans Day,\u201d said Will Fischer, who served in Iraq as a Marine and is now with the VoteVets group.\n\nLess than two-and-a-half hours after Trump\u2019s 7:44 a.m. tweet, the White House announced that Trump would remain there with no public events for the rest of the day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to Arlington. He\u2019s not even going up to Walter Reed,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cOnce again, Donald Trump only sees the military as props. If it doesn\u2019t benefit him, he\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d\n\nArlington National Cemetery is minutes from the White House across the Potomac River in Virginia. Walter Reed is the Army hospital a short helicopter ride away in Bethesda, Maryland, where service members wounded in combat are treated.\n\nThe White House did not respond to repeated queries about the president\u2019s lack of a schedule on Monday. Nor did it respond to questions about Trump\u2019s decision to cancel a visit to the American cemetery in France on Saturday and instead remain indoors tweeting, rather than go to an alternate site closer by.\n\nMilitary officials in charge of transporting Trump prefer not to fly the Marine One helicopter through rain or fog, and the Secret Service prefers not to use motorcades for long drives when abroad.\n\nIn a statement to reporters during Trump\u2019s flight back to Washington on Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that a motorcade to the Aisne-Marne cemetery some 55 miles northeast of Paris would have lasted two-and-a-half hours each way and required many hours of road closures that would have been a major inconvenience for local residents.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-hour estimate, though, is considerably longer than the estimates from both Google Maps and Mappy, a site popular in France, which came up with one hour and 22 minutes on Monday afternoon. And presidential motorcades generally drive significantly faster than ordinary motorists are allowed to.\n\nWhite House advance teams usually plan for contingencies, particularly weather, by coming up with alternative travel arrangements and alternative destinations.\n\n\u201cAdvance teams, working in close coordination with the Secret Service, typically start building contingency plans weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 in advance,\u201d said Ned Price, a spokesman for then-President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council who sat through many hours of advance team debriefs in the last administration.\n\n\u201cThey do so with precisely this type of scenario in mind, and rain in this part of France would\u2019ve been high on the list of envisioned contingencies,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt would seem to strain credulity to believe that President Trump was unable to attend the ceremony. It seems much more likely that he chose not to.\u201d\n\nThere are other American cemeteries and monuments closer to Paris, and Trump could have visited one of them instead, even on short notice. Quick unannounced visits are often deemed relatively safe by the Secret Service because potential adversaries have no time to plan for them, either.\n\nInstead, as other European leaders braved the rain Saturday to attend commemorative services at various sites around Paris, Trump remained at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence the entire afternoon and into the evening, when he arrived more than an hour late to a state dinner hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nFischer, of VoteVets, is skeptical that the president even made good use of those hours. \u201cI think he sat there in a bathrobe watching Fox News and tweeting ridiculousness,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the afternoon, Trump had, in fact, issued tweets, including: \u201cTrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2015, Trump claimed that he would be the \u201cmost militaristic\u201d president the country had ever seen. (He likely meant he would be the most supportive of the military, rather than the one most prone to start wars, which is what that phrasing might more readily imply.)\n\nHis words and actions, though, have not necessarily reflected support for the military and its members. Before he became president, Trump insulted the late Sen. John McCain, a former POW, saying that he himself preferred those who had not been captured. He also insulted a Gold Star Muslim family whose son had been killed in 2004 in Iraq while saving those under his U.S. Army command.\n\nSince he became president, Trump has made but a single visit to Dover Air Force Base to meet the returning coffins of fallen soldiers and has never visited troops in a combat zone. Even the two major accomplishments he boasts of \u2015providing record-high budgets for the military and passing a law to let veterans see local private doctors \u2015 are both false.\n\nObama approved a $721 billion defense budget in 2010 and a $717 billion budget in 2011. Both were higher than the $716 billion budget this year that Trump repeatedly brags about \u2013 even before adjusting for inflation. And the \u201cveterans choice\u201d program that Trump claims passed because of him was actually also passed under Obama, in 2014.\n\nAnd now, Trump has deployed thousands of troops to the Mexican border to string up barbed wire against what he describes as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Central American refugees seeking asylum, even though they are still hundreds of miles away. The soldiers are likely to remain there through the Thanksgiving holiday, at least.\n\n\u201cRipping people from their families and their training and deploying them to the border for the purpose of, well, your guess is as good as mine,\u201d Fischer said.\n\nTrump himself avoided military service when he had the opportunity during the Vietnam War, receiving four education deferments and then claiming a medical exemption because of bone spurs in his heels.\n\nHe later compared the dangers of war to the risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases from the women he was sleeping with. \u201cIt is my personal Vietnam,\u201d he told radio host Howard Stern in 1997. \u201cI feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d\n\nDespite his personal avoidance of military service, though, Trump has long described himself as a great supporter of the armed forces and has particularly enjoyed the pageantry associated with it.\n\nAfter attending France\u2019s Bastille Day parade in 2017, Trump told the U.S. Defense Department that he wanted a full military parade of his own, including tanks, for Veterans Day 2018. But after cost estimates of $92 million for the event \u2015 which included estimates for repairing roads damaged by the tanks \u2013 were leaked in August, Trump canceled the parade and announced he would go to Paris, instead.\n\n\u201cThe local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up! I will instead attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date, & go to the Paris parade, celebrating the end of the War, on November 11th. Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\u201d he wrote in a pair of Aug. 17 tweets.\n\nBut there was no parade of any consequence in Paris this past weekend.

Colorado had one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of staffing vacancies for VHA facilities.\n\nBy Tim Henderson\n\nAs the nation marks Veterans Day, many veterans in rural areas and some cities still face long wait times for health care because there aren\u2019t enough doctors, nurses and support staff to provide it.\n\nAlmost 40,000 of the 335,000 positions in the Veterans Health Administration are vacant, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, which oversees the VHA. The VHA serves about 9 million veterans.\n\nThe VHA\u2019s turnover rate is less than half the rate for the health care industry overall.\n\nHowever, a Stateline analysis of recently released federal figures shows the VHA has a severe vacancy problem in high-cost urban areas such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and in largely rural states, such as Montana and Colorado.\n\nMontana and Colorado have the highest state job vacancy rates at more than 20 percent, followed by Utah, Oklahoma and Maryland. At the other end, vacancies in Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Rhode Island are less than 8 percent.\n\nIn some ways, the challenges facing the VHA are the same ones facing the health care workforce as a whole, especially in rural areas like Montana, said Kristin Mattocks, a Montana native and associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who has studied VHA efforts to improve care for veterans.\n\nNationally, job openings in the health care sector have nearly tripled to 1.1 million since 2010, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Most of the communities with shortages of health care workers are in rural areas, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are also shortages in Honolulu, Hawaii, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs more doctors and other providers in the VHA and elsewhere have been retiring, there\u2019s more pressure on the remaining doctors to absorb more patients and speed up appointments.\n\n\u201cNow the pressure is put on physicians, which is probably driving some folks\u201d away, Mattocks said.\n\nThe vacancy rates, detailed in a new report required by legislation Congress approved this year, can cause long wait times for appointments, create waitlists for artificial limbs and lead to unsanitary conditions.\n\nMost of the nearly 40,000 vacancies are for medical and dental staff such as doctors and nurses. Those professionals are hard to find and keep because VHA\u2019s hiring process is time-consuming and the pay is lower than in the private sector.\n\nAnd because there isn\u2019t sufficient support staff, many VHA doctors say they are frustrated by having to do more paperwork and even clean offices, federal audits have shown.\n\nIn Colorado last year, the Denver Post found that the VHA postponed surgeries because it didn\u2019t have enough anesthesiologists. Understaffing led to dirty storage rooms and canceled surgeries for anesthetized patients at the VHA\u2019s flagship hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd veterans in Connecticut had a hard time getting appointments for counseling because four key jobs were vacant earlier this year. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, in a September hearing called the vacancy figures \u201creally staggering.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal added that leaders of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter had complained that care was held up at a Norwich, Connecticut, clinic because the local office lacked a director, a case manager, an outreach coordinator and a counselor.\n\nAt the same hearing, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie also expressed alarm about the number of vacancies. And he said hiring for mental health centers such as the one in Connecticut is a priority.\n\n\u201cOn its face it is staggering,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cIf we tried to fill all 40,000 we\u2019d never get where we need. \u2026 We have to concentrate on, I think, four areas: primary care, internists, mental health workers and women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nHe added that this year\u2019s Mission Act legislation, which President Donald Trump signed in June, will give him more power to raise pay and forgive student loans to attract more medical professionals.\n\nThe agency has stepped up hiring in the past two years, Wilkie said, in response to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that found that VHA lost an increasing number of employees each year between 2011 and 2015.\n\nIn the five clinical occupations with the worst shortages, including physicians, registered nurses and psychologists, VHA\u2019s employee losses grew from about 5,900 in 2011 to about 7,700 in 2015. Voluntary resignations and retirements were the primary drivers.\n\n\u201cVHA remains fully engaged in a fiercely competitive clinical recruitment market,\u201d the agency said in a statement about the vacancy data. The VA did not respond to requests from Stateline for further comment.\n\nStaffing vacancies have contributed to recent scandals involving long wait times for care \u2014 some veterans died while waiting for appointments \u2014 and the falsifying of wait-time data to deflect scrutiny.\n\nHiring woes continued into 2017, a GAO report said, in part because a federal hiring freeze ordered by Trump limited the agency\u2019s ability to hire doctors. Doctors were exempt from the freeze, but there weren\u2019t enough personnel workers to recruit and hire them, the report concluded, and some were not well-trained to do the job.\n\nThe shortage of trained recruiters undermines the VHA\u2019s effectiveness, the report stated, and \u201cimpedes its ability to improve delivery of health care access to veterans.\u201d\n\nA 2016 report from the congressionally appointed Commission on Care found that VHA doctors and nurses were cleaning offices and doing paperwork because of inadequate numbers of support staff. The commission also detailed a scandal over employees falsifying wait times for service, and some deaths of veterans on waitlists. An understaffed Phoenix administration system struggled to meet a target of 14-day maximum wait times for appointments.\n\nThe report pointed to \u201cstaffing shortages and vacancies\u201d at every level. It also said VHA salaries aren\u2019t competitive, and that the agency \u201ccontinues to use a talent management approach from the last century.\u201d\n\nOther reports have described the effects of those shortcomings. In Washington, D.C., the VA inspector general found conditions so chaotic that sometimes doctors had to borrow equipment from other hospitals during treatment, and surgery was postponed because equipment was discovered missing or broken after the patient was anesthetized. Employees told inspectors the problems were caused by a support staff shortage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, this fall called VHA staffing shortages the most critical issue facing the agency, saying the high rate of vacancies in Montana and elsewhere is hurting care for veterans.\n\n\u201cI continue to hear from veterans across Montana and elsewhere that vacancies and constant turnover in VA facilities impacts how quickly they can get appointments and prevents them from building quality doctor-patient relationships,\u201d Tester, who is running for re-election, wrote in a September letter to Wilkie.\n\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington state, told Wilkie at the hearing that the fast-growing Seattle area has been particularly hard hit by service shortages. A clinic on the Kitsap Peninsula, west of Seattle, took years to approve and build and will likely be at capacity when it opens next year, Murray said.\n\nNearly a quarter of the staff positions were vacant at VHA facilities in Washington, D.C., and Augusta, Georgia, as of July. But U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican who sponsored the Mission Act, said this fall that things seem to be improving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten letters from my district, unsolicited, veterans who used to write me about how we weren\u2019t worth anything because we couldn\u2019t get anything done, [now] thanking me for the efficient way the operation works now,\u201d Isakson said at the September hearing.\n\nWilkie, who was confirmed this year, called the job vacancy data \u201can important step in transparency\u201d but stressed that some vacancies are normal and that some represent new positions created to anticipate future growth. Also, Wilkie said, time to complete a specialist referral has fallen from 19 days in 2014 to about one day this year.\n\nThe agency publishes current wait times for appointments, and some facilities with high vacancy-rates have long waits for appointments: The Augusta, Georgia, veterans hospital had a 34-day wait for primary care. Chillicothe, Ohio\u2019s hospital, with one of the country\u2019s lowest vacancy rates, had only a six-day wait.\n\nBut average wait times are high even in some hospitals with low vacancies \u2014 the Honolulu hospital has only about a 2 percent vacancy rate, the lowest in the country, but its average wait time \u2014 39 days \u2014 is one of the highest."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "HBO's \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 Discriminates Against Blind People", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hbo-discriminates-against-blind_us_5be073e1e4b04367a87f1cab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "I\u2019ve watched the trailer for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d the first installment of HBO\u2019s adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, about 30 times.\n\nI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019ve been watching it three to five times in a sitting, ever since it came out. Every time I tear up.\n\nBut the reason I get emotional doesn\u2019t have so much to do with the fact that it\u2019s a book series that I very much relate to and love. What really gets me is that I have Stargardt disease \u2014 a condition similar to macular degeneration, which renders me legally blind, or having low vision \u2014 and probably won\u2019t be able to watch the series.\n\nFerrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were written in Italian before being translated for a global audience and HBO has decided that the dialogue in its hotly anticipated new series will stay true to the source material (not just Italian but a Neapolitan dialect), which means it\u2019ll be entirely in subtitles.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool move, and HBO has patted itself on the back for its devotion to authenticity, especially since other Italy-set series, such as \u201cRome\u201d and \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d had English dialogue.\n\nBut I can\u2019t read subtitles. I can\u2019t even read the notes my loved ones write on my birthday cards without someone\u2019s help or a magnifier. I also can\u2019t read street signs, which caused me to lose my driver\u2019s license, uproot my entire life and move to New York City, which has better public transportation than my hometown, at age 29. It\u2019s a similar story for countless other people with visual disabilities.\n\nMany people with visual disabilities often rely on a feature called video description or audio description when they watch TV. It is a feature in which a narrator tells someone who can\u2019t see well what is happening on the screen.\n\nPeople with low vision don\u2019t use it all the time. For example, I can usually watch TV with relative ease, just as long as I\u2019m sitting a few inches from the screen. But those who are blind and have more severe cases of low vision depend on it. HBO won\u2019t be including audio description for \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d though.\n\nWith HBO\u2019s decision to not feature audio description, the premium cable network has decided to embrace one culture while completely alienating another that already has to navigate life with endless obstacles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t anything new. The network has been ignoring the basic needs of the blind and low-vision community for as long as it\u2019s been in existence.\n\nHBO confirmed to HuffPost that it does not offer video description services for any of its programming. In this case, audio description could also have easily been used to translate the Italian dialogue into English, according to Joel Snyder, president of Audio Description Associates, a company that makes video descriptions.\n\nSnyder said it could be done much like an audiobook. For example, one audio describer or voice actor could read the script\u2019s action lines in one voice or tone and then use a distinctively different voice or tone for the dialogue. It could also be done with multiple voice actors, one of which reads the action lines and another (or others) who read or act out the dialogue.\n\n\u201cA skilled audio describer who has researched pronunciations could even make the subtitles more meaningful,\u201d he told me.\n\nThough it may seem like the final product could be confusing to listen to, Diane Johnson, president and CEO of an audio description company called Descriptive Video that does audio descriptions for Netflix original series such as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cDear White People\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d told me that isn\u2019t the case. For instance, when she was first asked by the streaming service to do audio description for their original series \u201cNarcos,\u201d a show that uses numerous languages, she was concerned there would be \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\nBut after conducting focus groups for people in Spanish and English who listened to the video description for the show, she realized it could be done in a clear manner.\n\nSo, if an audio description company can figure out how to tackle a complicated script and deliver a clear product that aids millions of potential viewers, why wouldn\u2019t HBO want to take advantage of that? Especially since Johnson told me it could be done quickly and it is affordable\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m new to being ostracized by HBO because \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d is the first of its original series in the U.S. to be aired in another language, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nYet, people who are completely blind or have more severe cases of low vision have never been able to watch any HBO series, regardless of its huge presence in American culture, because the network has never really offered audio description. Snyder told me he is aware of just one project that HBO made an audio description for \u2014 2009\u2019s \u201cMonica & David,\u201d a documentary about two people with Down syndrome getting married \u2014 because his company did it. He also noted that it was done only because the producer wanted it.\n\nCould you imagine how isolating it must feel to be hanging out with your friends, family or colleagues and not be able to chime in with your \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories? Or never being able to fully grasp the cultural significance of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cSex and the City\u201d? Or being blind and not being able to engage with an HBO documentary about being blind?\n\nThe decision to simply not include video description has real-life consequences for those who are blind and have low vision.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are unemployed that are blind and vision impaired,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll tell you part of the reason is that they feel like they\u2019re socially inept. \u2026 They feel alienated. Why would we do that to anyone?\u201d\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s insulting, ablelist and reinforces the notion in society that people with disabilities are less than those without.\n\nThe network has received pushback from the community for not including video descriptions. There have been petitions and published mentions of this injustice. Yet HBO won\u2019t budge, nor did it offer me any explanation as to why it does not offer audio description when I reached out to the company.\n\nHBO is not legally required to provide audio description, unfortunately. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed, with help from Stevie Wonder, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, a law that requires advanced technology to be accessible to people with disabilities \u2014 and this includes audio descriptions for television and movies. Yet, the CVAA, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, currently requires only nine television channels \u2014 the top four broadcast networks and top five cable channels \u2014 to provide audio description. The current list includes ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Discovery, HGTV, History, TBS and USA.\n\nA representative from the FCC told me that HBO\u2019s Nielsen ratings are not high enough for it to be required by law to provide video description.\n\nInterestingly enough, HBO does offer closed captioning, which provides subtitles for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThat, to me, is completely confusing. Why would HBO allow some who are disabled to enjoy its shows rather than all disabled people?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "16 Gifts For Fitness Enthusiasts Who'd Rather Be Working Out", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fitness-gifts-for-fitness-lovers-him-her_us_5be8b0d8e4b0e843889944eb", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "DisobeyArt via Getty Images\n\nThey wake up at the crack of dawn, schedule workouts in-between work meetings and book hotels based on their proximity to gyms and studios.

What first drew us together was our love of style. That night I chatted so openly with him because I believed he was gay. He was wearing a purple Lanvin suit with a floral tie, a polka-dotted pocket square and striped socks. I couldn\u2019t believe that a man who dressed so well could actually be straight.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after our third \u201cdate\u201d (he wore a blue window-paned suit and red shoes) that I began to realize that he wasn\u2019t interested in being my stylish gay friend, but my stylish boyfriend.\n\nEverything blossomed. We spent weekends vintage shopping, he flew out to join me when I traveled for work, he would stay over at my place for days on end. But something was amiss. He never wanted me to visit his apartment.\n\nI wondered what he was hiding \u2014 a second family, a love of taxidermy, a mother? It all seemed especially odd as this man with such incredible personal style would surely live in the chicest of pads.\n\nTalking him into inviting me over was a lengthy process. He swerved my requests constantly or offered frustrating platitudes like, \u201cOne day, darling.\u201d I could see that it was a sensitive subject for him and, not wishing to rock the love boat, I allowed this dynamic to continue for an entire year before something inside me snapped.\n\nI had an upcoming day filled with Manhattan-based appointments and I asked him if I could use his apartment between meetings rather than schlepping back to my Brooklyn pad in between. I saw the dodge coming as he began to shift in his chair. I broke, my request turning into an infuriated demand. This time he relented. He stood up from his chair and gathered his coat and bag, claiming he needed to \u201ctidy the place up a little\u201d before I arrived the next day. I wondered if I\u2019d ever see him again, but I had his address, or at least the address he\u2019d given me.\n\nEntering the building, I was greeted by a doorman. This boded well. I rode the elevator to the seventh floor and as I stepped out and moved along the corridor, Richard\u2019s face appeared through the crack of an apartment door.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t judge me,\u201d he quietly pleaded.\n\n\u201cOf course I won\u2019t judge you, how bad can it be?\u201d I responded.\n\nStepping inside, I was met by a scene reminiscent of the TV show \u201cHoarders.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried about me saying anything because words truly failed me. The blinds were drawn and no lights were on, but in the darkness I could make out very little floor space underneath endless piles of\u2026 stuff. He had to guide me through it by the hand. He led me into the small galley kitchen, which resembled a community theatre set of a 1980s kitchen. Faux-wood laminate cabinets hung off the walls at crooked angles and a fridge that had presumably once been white was gray. The \u201cMad Men\u201d-style apartment I\u2019d envisioned had been replaced with the reality that this was the apartment of an actual madman.\n\nNone of it made sense. This was a man who matched his eyeglass frames to his socks. This was a man who agreed that leopard print was a neutral. This was a man who once suggested I\u2019d look good in red, to which I scoffed, tried on the red dress he\u2019d picked out, twirled before the mirror and wore the dress to a party the very next day. This was a man of exquisite tastes. Or was he?\n\nFive minutes in that storage-unit-masquerading-as-an-apartment was all I could manage the first time, but I\u2019m no quitter. I came back the next day and made the first of what would turn out to be a string of demands. This one was simple: Turn the lights on.\n\nWith the full scope of the situation revealed to me by a flickering overhead light, I wasn\u2019t really sure how to react. I was horrified, but so was he. What could I say that he didn\u2019t already know? I was standing in the smoldering ruins of a marriage, a compulsive shopping habit stemming from his diagnosed OCD, and a giant relationship hurdle I wasn\u2019t sure I could clear. We shut the door on the apartment and I didn\u2019t return for a month.\n\nHumans are very adaptable, and it\u2019s true that you can get used to anything given enough time. Little by little, I started to stay over at his chaotic apartment. I couldn\u2019t find anything in the mess so it meant that I was waited on hand and foot by my continually embarrassed boyfriend. The surroundings were insufferable, but it was fun to be brought coffee and sandwiches as I tapped away on my laptop in the middle of the bed, the only area that was clear.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Ruthie Darling\n\nIf outwardly I was understanding, inside I was plotting. I just needed a window of opportunity to enact my dastardly plan, and that moment arrived one weekend when Richard announced he\u2019d be heading out of town for the day to visit his family. I knew what this meant for me: hours alone in this nightmarish place and access to cleaning products. What I was planning was risky, but someone needed to break the hex on this apartment. I didn\u2019t have a sage stick, but I did have Fantastik.\n\nAs he left the apartment he eyed me suspiciously. \u201cThere\u2019s coffee in the pot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGreat. Should I ever find it, I\u2019ll drink it,\u201d I replied with a wink.\n\nHe sighed and moved toward the elevator wearing an eggplant-colored vest over a Pucci shirt with burnt-orange pants, an ensemble only he could pull off so nonchalantly. As the apartment door clicked shut, I spun around like a Bond villainess. I think I was actually rubbing my hands together.\n\nIt took me 45 minutes to locate the vacuum cleaner, but once I found it I was cleaning those floors like a drugged-up 1950s housewife. I put clothes in the closets, I put books on shelves and wiped years of dust off of old photo frames. Anything clearly garbage was bagged up and slowly but surely, parquet floor tiles began to emerge before me.\n\nI wish I could say that my cleaning spell resembled one of those montage scenes in the movies, the kind where we see a whirlwind of activity underscored by Survivor\u2019s \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and that ends in a sparkling apartment. Alas, this would take more than one afternoon, plus I\u2019d run out of Windex.\n\nLater that evening, when I heard the key in the lock, I braced myself. I had no idea what his reaction would be. I hoped he\u2019d fall to his knees in gratitude, but I\u2019m a realist and change is hard.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d was his first question, his face full of anxiety. \u201cI had a system! How will I find anything now?\u201d\n\nI almost laughed, but thought better of it. An evening of sulking and heavy sighing on his part ensued, and I figured I had gone too far. I left for my own apartment that night and realized that my actions were perhaps invasive and cruel. I sent an apology text that went unanswered. Concerned for the state of our relationship, I returned to his apartment the next day with a rehearsed apology speech, only to run into him in the lobby pulling a handcart piled high with boxes. He smiled at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking all of these to Housing Works,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since my \u201ccleaning spell\u201d and progress has been made. Not only can we now walk about without falling over things, but some treasures have been unearthed.\n\nOne thing I will say in praise of never throwing anything away is that his apartment is truly a museum of his life, even if mostly the life he had before we met. I\u2019ve spent evenings with him reading through sweet love letters from 30 years ago, leafing through his art school projects and holding old slides up to the (now clean) windows. We even found an article a former girlfriend had written about him in Cosmopolitan in 1981 titled \u201cThe Terribly Tidy Man.\u201d The irony was not lost on us, and I\u2019m considering contacting her to collaborate on a before and after book.\n\nI know more about Richard through sifting the contents of his apartment than I ever could have hoped to by simply hearing him reminisce. Though photos of his ex-wife now reside in drawers, I would never have him throw them out. He loved her once, and who am I to discard love? All the experiences he\u2019s had in his life have formed him into the sweet, nutty man I love now. I don\u2019t wish to destroy this museum, only curate it. Some things on display, others in the archives.\n\nThe place also needs to be repainted. This will be difficult for him, I predict, but we\u2019ll do it together, not when he\u2019s out of town."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "See The Stirring Anti-Palm Oil Ad Deemed Too Political For TV", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/palm-oil-ad-too-political-for-tv_us_5be830dbe4b0e8438898e8d0", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "A stirring television ad that highlights palm oil\u2019s massive wildlife destruction has been barred from TV broadcast in the U.K. after it was deemed too political.\n\nThe animated film shows an orangutan making a child\u2019s bedroom its home after its mother and rainforest habitat were destroyed by growers of palm oil, a vegetable oil that\u2019s found in roughly half of all packaged products sold in supermarkets.\n\nSuch destruction has contributed to orangutans being classified as critically endangered.\n\nBritish grocery store Iceland released the video titled \u201cRang-tan\u201d last week as its Christmas advertisement.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013.

And he equates his political success with that of Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor whose campaign was taken over by Trump aides, as well as with that of Mr. Scott, whose victory he believes he ensured by campaigning across the state and pulling him over the finish line. Mr. Trump sees the recounts, one person close to him said, as akin to a personal attack.\n\nMr. Trump has been more combative and unrestrained in slinging claims of fraud and unfairness than Mr. Scott or Mr. DeSantis. The recount story hits many of the president\u2019s sore spots, including his frequent insistence that his political opponents cheat against him and his unproved belief that American elections are tainted with illegal voting, especially by undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut with such aggressive, unyielding attacks on Democrats, Mr. Trump and his Republicans risk treading into territory that is a minefield of tension over race. Their repeated allegations of subterfuge and fraudulent ballots are a blunt appeal to a political base motivated by the notion that elections are often stolen by Democrats. And in this case, some of the central players are African-Americans, including Mr. Gillum and the Broward County supervisor of elections, Brenda C. Snipes, whom Republicans like Mr. Scott have called out by name for enabling \u201crampant fraud,\u201d as the governor put it last week.\n\nIn the face of the Republican cries of ballot fraud and political mischief, Judge Tuter in Broward County refused a request by Mr. Scott to order the county police to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use. The judge was also critical of comments made by Mr. Scott\u2019s lawyers on television and social media perpetuating the unsubstantiated rumors of fraud."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Bipartisan Sentencing Overhaul Moves Forward, but Rests on Trump", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/prison-sentencing-criminal-justice-reform.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-13 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "[Read the bill language here.]\n\n\u201cWe have the clearest path forward that we have had in years,\u201d said Holly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition arguing for an overhaul. \u201cThis would be the first time that these members have voted on a piece of legislation that turns away from the lock-\u2019em-up-and-throw-away-the-keys policies of the 1990s.
