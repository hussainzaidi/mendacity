His move complicated a difficult, highly sensitive investigation that is being closely watched in Afghanistan and could even have implications down the road for the security of American soldiers serving in a dangerous environment.\n\nTrump also fired off a weekend tweet accusing the FBI of breaking in to the office of Michael Cohen, his ex-lawyer who is headed to prison next year. The raid was carried out on a court endorsed warrant.\n\nRemember, Michael Cohen only became a \"Rat\" after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE! Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked's office?\n\nAnd last week, Trump raised doubts over the apolitical independence of the legal system by suggesting he coul d use a top Chinese executive awaiting extradition from Canada on fraud charges as a chip in his trade war.\n\nHis comment put Canada, who first arrested Huawei's Meng Wanzhou, in a tough diplomatic spot, raised questions about whether she would receive due process and could undermine US critiques of the way judicial systems in China and other totalitarian states are subordinate to politics.\n\nBut Trump's challenge to legal norms is not new.\n\nIn two years in office, Trump has built a mountain of tweets, remarks and actions that do not just test institutional restraints on presidential power but appear to undermine the constitutional norms he is sworn to uphold.\n\nHis willingness to use the weight of his office in such a way appears to be increasing the prospect of a constitutional imbroglio at a time when multiple areas of Trump's public, political and business life are under investigation.\n\nAnd it risks lingering damage to the infrastructure of American justice and the public support that is essential for democratic and judicial institutions to retain legitimacy even after he has left office.\n\nThat possibility seems to lie behind Comey's concern.\n\n\"This is not about Republicans and Democrats. This is about what does it mean to be an American,\" Comey said after testifying on Capitol Hill Monday.\n\n\"We have to stop being numb to it, whether you're Republican or Democrat, stand on your feet, overcome your shame and say something.\"\n\nNo let up\n\nTrump started to jolt America's judicial and legal system as soon as he moved into the White House, castigating judges who slowed his agenda and piling pressure on the Justice Department over the Russia probe.\n\nThere's been no let up since.\n\nThe President's unconventional relationship with the law goes far beyond the numerous legal challenges to his presidency, transition and campaign and the unusual number of associates who have fallen foul of prosecutors.\n\nHe's sued and been sued countless times, often using the legal system and bankruptcy courts as a tactical tool as a real estate tycoon.\n\nTrump has so far not been found guilty of any wrongdoing by Mueller or prosecutors elsewhere. He denies he has done anything wrong.\n\nBut it is extraordinary that he has been indirectly implicated by federal prosecutors in New York in cooperating with Cohen to pay hush money to women who accused him of affairs, in violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nAnother former Trump aide, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, will learn on Tuesday whether he will go to prison for lying to the FBI.\n\nUnprecedented for at least 40 years\n\nMany presidents have had frustrations with the legal system and criticized court rulings and irksome judges. Tensions between branches of government are inherent in the US political system.\n\nBut no modern president has racked up a record like Trump, who has risked the integrity of the justice system of which he is the titular head for apparently personal and political reasons.\n\n\"I think that at least going back 40 years there is no comparison that you can make in terms of degree,\" said Rudy Mehrbani, senior counsel at the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.\n\n\"He really doesn't respect the judiciary and the rule of law as we expect and need Presidents to. ... He just weighs in for what I think are clear partisan political purposes.\"\n\nThe President has publicly appeared to dangle the possibility of a pardon in front of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort who faces years in jail.\n\nIn tirades more typical of a despot, he has demanded his political foes be investigated by the Justice Department. He beams when crowds chant \"lock her up\" in reference to Hillary Clinton at his rallies.\n\nHis pardons of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and conservative polemicist Dinesh D'Souza were criticized as a pure partisan play to please his base.\n\nIn November, he slammed a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as an \"Obama judge\" after he contravened the administration's asylum policy. In an exceedingly rare move, C hief Justice John Roberts issued a statement contradicting the President's remarks.\n\nTrump responded by proposing the break up of the Ninth Circuit.\n\nIn 2017, Trump accused judges of thwarting the fight against terrorism by overturning his executive orders on immigration.\n\nTrump didn't even wait to become President to slam the judiciary: in 2016 he singled out American-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel over the Trump University civil suit, arguing his Mexican heritage meant he could not deliver a fair verdict.\n\nPresidential pressure\n\nTrump's challenge to the rule of law has not been confined to the judiciary.\n\nFor two years he has leaned hard on the Justice Department. His beef with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was that he recused himself over the Russia probe in accordance with departmental norms.\n\nThen there has been the incessant effort to demean Mueller and the FBI, in an apparent campaign to devalue any eventual critical conclusions out of the Russia investigation. According to Comey, the President asked him to go easy on Flynn. The former FBI chief's firing triggered the appointment of Mueller and an investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nTrump has often given the impression that he views the Justice Department as owing loyalty to him rather than the rule of law.\n\n\"So often, the President would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it,\" former secretary of state Rex Tillerson said in one of his first public appearances since leaving the administration.\n\n\"And I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can't do it that way. It violates the law,' \" Tillerson said.\n\nTrump supporters often argue that his critics take his tweets and comments too seriously. And they reject any criticism by Comey, who many conservatives accuse of giving Clinton a pass on her email server.\n\nDemocrats are still fuming at the former FBI chief because they believe he handed the White House to Trump by reopening the Clinton probe days before the election.\n\nTrump backers, who chose someone to shake up what they saw as a corrupt political establishment either do not perceive a threat to the rule of law -- or really don't care that much. Their perceptions of Trump's behavior are also filtered through the conservative media machine. And the President's approval ratings of 80% and higher among Republicans offer him a safety net with his political base.\n\nBut there is an increasing expectation of a legal reckoning in Washington as Mueller appears to be aiming directly at the President as he approaches the end of his investigation.\n\nThat means that Trump has likely yet to pose his most grave test to the legal system and the rule of law."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Don Lemon: So much for the 'law and order' President", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/MtccMIhbrwc/dons-take-trump-flynn-comey-cohen-giuliani-don-lemon-ctn-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

There is a truth and they're not telling it. Their silence is shameful.\"\n\nComey's comments came after he spent more than five hours behind closed doors on Monday with Republicans and Democrats. He was questioned on the FBI's handling of both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia investigation.\n\nComey issued a fiery and defiant statement as he left Monday, charging Trump and Republicans with damaging the FBI's reputation and asserting that \"damage has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n\"The FBI's reputation has taken a big hit because the President of the United States has lied about it constantly,\" Comey said.\n\nBehind closed doors, Comey defended the FBI, saying he and the bureau made the right call in 2017 when he rebuffed Trump's requests to announce publicly that the President wasn't under investigation, a source familiar with the interview told CNN.\n\nUnder questioning from Democrats, Comey said that he didn't want to declare publicly that Trump wasn't under investigation because of a concern that the situation could change and the FBI would have to make another announcement. And he told lawmakers that he was proven right because it now appears Trump was in fact under investigation, the source said, though Comey said that he was only basing that from public reporting and not any inside knowledge.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders responded to Comey's comments by tweeting Monday evening: \"Republicans should stand up to Comey and his tremendous corruption - from the fake Hillary Clinton investigation, to lying and leaking, to FISA abuse, and a list too long to name. The President did the country a service by firing him and exposing him for the shameless fraud he is.\"\n\nFlynn's FBI interview under scrutiny\n\nComey also defended the FBI's interview with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was later charged with lying in the January 2017 interview, and he slammed Trump's labeling his former attorney Michael Cohen a \"rat.\"\n\n\"This is the President of the United States calling a witness, who has cooperated with his own Justice Department a rat,\" Comey said. \"We have to stop being numb to it; whether you're Republican or Democrat, stand on your feet, overcome your shame and say something.\"\n\nRepublicans had a different view of Comey's interview, not to mention his tenure as FBI director, raising questions about his handling of the opposition research dossier on Trump and Russia among other topics, including the January 2017 FBI interview with Flynn.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows said going into the Comey interview Monday that he felt there were inconsistencies in the former FBI director's testimony earlier this month.\n\n\"I think that the knowledge of when the FBI and specifically Director Comey became aware of the involvement of the DNC, Perkins Coie, Fusion GPS as it relates to their hiring of Christopher Steele, the whole FISA application. At what point did he become aware of that?\" Meadows said.\n\n\"He seemed to indicate the other day that he wasn't aware of that until he read reports long after he was gone,\" Meadows added. \"I find that very hard to substantiate based on other evidence. So hopefully we'll give him a chance today to clarify that. I can tell you when you look at his public statements and also his testimony, those don't seem to reconcile, so we're going to give him a chance to hopefully reconcile his remarks.\"\n\nRepublicans spent the first part of Monday's interview with a lengthy discussion on the FBI's interview with Flynn, which eventually led to his charges by special counsel Robert Mueller. The Republican questioning over Flynn was going on at the same time Monday that charges were announced by the Justice Department against two of Flynn's associates, according to the source familiar with the interview.\n\nAfter the interview, Comey defended the FBI's interview with Flynn, including his decision not to inform then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates about it ahead of time.\n\n\"Oh come on. Think about what's happening in the Republican Party. They're up here, attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who (pleaded) guilty to lying to the FBI,\" Comey said when asked to respond to the criticism. \"I'm very proud of the way the FBI conducted itself.\"\n\nComey returns\n\nComey sat down with lawmakers from both parties for another six-hour interview earlier this month. The committees are also interviewing former Attorney General Loretta Lynch behind closed doors on Wednesday.\n\nMonday's sequel with Comey was odd in at least one respect because the 235-page transcript of the first part of Comey's interview was released the day after he testified, giving the public an opportunity to Monday-morning quarterback the proceedings before they concluded.\n\nRepublicans left that previous interview saying they were frustrated with the questions that Comey couldn't answer, and they noted after the interview how many times Comey had responded that he did not know or recall an answer to their questions.\n\nBut Democrats have criticized bringing Comey back. Rep. Lacy Clay, a Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, called the interview so far a waste of time, saying it amounted to the \"last gasp\" of the Republican majority.\n\nTrump also took the opportunity to weigh in on Twitter to attack Comey and the special counsel investigation.\n\n\"Leakin' James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day,\" Trump tweeted last week, without providing evidence for his claim. \"His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!\"\n\nComey offered his own assessment after the first round of questions had concluded, tweeting that the interview \"wasn't a search for truth, but a desperate attempt to find anything that can be used to attack the institutions of justice investigating this president. They came up empty today but will try again. In the long run, it'll make no difference because facts are stubborn things.\"\n\nLast chance for House GOP\n\nComey's two interviews are part of the Republican-led congressional investigation into the FBI's conduct during the 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton's email and Russia.\n\nThe interviews with Comey and Lynch are likely to be among the last for the Republican-led investigation, as incoming Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-New York, has already made clear he has no interest in continuing the Republican FBI probe once Democrats take control of the House.\n\nGowdy and outgoing Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte are also retiring from Congress. They haven't yet said what they plan to do to summarize their findings in the yearlong investigation into the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nIn the transcript of Comey's interview earlier this month, the former FBI director defended the FBI's investigations as well as Mueller's integrity.\n\n\"There are not many things I would bet my life on. I would bet my life that Bob Mueller will do things the right way, the way we would all want, whether we're Republicans or Democrats, the way Americans should want,\" Comey said.\n\nMuch of the content of the interview was similar to the questions that the Justice Department inspector general probed in a report released earlier this year that faulted Comey for his actions in the Clinton email case.\n\nComey was quizzed about his interactions with Trump and a potential obstruction of justice case that would involve Trump's comments to him about the investigation into Flynn.\n\nThere also were some tidbits in the interview about the Russia investigation, a topic in which an FBI lawyer limited what Comey could discuss.\n\nBut Comey, for instance, said that the FBI's counterintelligence investigation opened in July 2016 was an investigation into four individuals and not the Trump campaign itself.\n\nNew information about Flynn interview, dossier\n\nThe two-part interview has one benefit for lawmakers: Two new documents have been released since Comey last appeared earlier this month.\n\nThe FBI on Friday released a redacted version of the memo that Comey and other top intelligence officials used to brief Trump about the dossier in January 2017. The memo discloses how Steele was described, and Republicans are likely to press Comey on why it didn't include the fact he was paid by Democrats.\n\nIn addition, the special counsel's office last week released memos from the FBI about Flynn's interview when he lied about the content of calls with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe memos were released to push back on an assertion from Flynn's attorneys that the FBI caught Flynn off guard with the January 2017 interview.\n\nThey're also relevant to Comey's congressional testimony, as lawmakers asked him about his assessment of the FBI's interview with Flynn during Comey's first round of testimony. Trump and some Republicans have also suggested that the FBI didn't initially believe Flynn lied after the interview.\n\n\"They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didn't lie and they overrode the FBI,\" Trump tweeted Thursday. \"They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. Sad!\"\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who was fired over anti-Trump text messages, wrote that the agents who interviewed Flynn had \"the impression that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.\" But the memos did not say whether the FBI made any judgments that day about whether Flynn was lying.\n\nAnd Comey pushed back on that notion in his testimony.\n\n\"My recollection was he was -- the conclusion of the investigators was he was obviously lying, but they saw none of the normal common indicia of deception: that is, hesitancy to answer, shifting in seat, sweating, all the things that you might associate with someone who is conscious and manifesting that they are being -- they're telling falsehoods,\" Comey said. \"There's no doubt he was lying, but that those indicators weren't there.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with developments throughout Monday."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Opinion: Best move is to charge Trump and seal indictment", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/aorFZdQMGXs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and of counsel to the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases.

Future historians might view the maudlin scene as the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\n\nPaul Callan\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Cohen's guilty pleas suggest that special counsel Robert Mueller and Southern District of New York federal prosecutors believe Cohen and Trump broke the law in paying hush money to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels. The clear purpose was to protect the president's reputation as a political candidate.\n\nIt is even possible that the president already has been indicted by a federal grand jury in a secret, sealed indictment that will be revealed only when he leaves the presidency. Of course, this is necessarily speculative, as prosecutors seal indictments to keep them secret.\n\nProsecutors generally use sealed indictments in three situations. The first is when they fear a suspect, upon hearing of his indictment, might destroy evidence before his arrest. The second is when they fear the suspect might flee. Neither of those applies to Trump. Even though he has the use of two well-equipped planes (Air Force One & Trump Force One), he is unlikely to flee the US and has no place to hide. But the third reason could be a factor: when the statute of limitations might expire before the suspect can be arraigned on the indictment.\n\nMueller and the New York Southern District prosecutors are bound by a Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Mueller releases memo summarizing FBI's interview with Flynn", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Ln4DKz4h1gw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:04", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has released a January 2017 memo detailing the FBI's interview that month with Michael Flynn -- a moment that led to a high-profile criminal case against the former Trump national security adviser.\n\nIn the interview described in the memo, Flynn lied about his contact during the presidential transition in 2016 with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. At times, Flynn offered the FBI agents more benign descriptions of what he and Kislyak had said about Russian policy.\n\nIn all, the newly released memo shows clear examples of Flynn denying he had made policy requests of Russia, and the agents prodding him toward fuller descriptions of the calls.\n\nThe release of the memo Monday night -- on the eve of Flynn's criminal sentencing for lying to investigators -- sets up a clearer picture of what he said to the FBI agents in January 2017. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in that interview and about his lobbying for the Turkish government. He will likely face zero to six months in prison, though Mueller's team has asked the judge to give him no prison time because he has helped their investigation, along with other federal probes.\n\nWhether the FBI decided Flynn was lying at that moment has become a touch point in President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Mueller investigation. Trump has latched on to whether Mueller pursued Flynn on a criminal charge at odds with the FBI's initial findings. Former FBI agent Peter Strzok's participation in the Flynn interview -- and the fact that Flynn was not warned he could be prosecuted for lying and had no lawyer in the room with him when he met with the FBI at the White House -- has also cast political shadows on the case.\n\nTrump has alleged the FBI determined that day that Flynn hadn't lied. Yet the memo from January 24, 2017, that was released Monday night does not say the FBI agents made any determinations at that time. The memo only outlines what Flynn said in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe subsequent criminal complaint, filed by Mueller's office in December 2017, outlined how Flynn's retelling of the conversations was wrong.\n\nA memo released by Mueller's office last week described how the FBI had known the facts of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak before the agency approached him in the West Wing. A separate memo filed with the court last week summarized how Strzok recalled he \"had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.\"\n\nTwo lies\n\nThe memo describes how Flynn downplayed the approach he had taken in his discussions with Kislyak when FBI agents asked about the discussions in the January 2017 interview. He told the agents that \"no,\" he had not sought to influence Russia's vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution about Israeli settlements.\n\nBut investigators knew, according to charging documents filed last year, that Flynn had asked for Russia to vote against or delay the resolution.\n\nFlynn's second lie, as described in the FBI memo, came in response to the agents asking him about the US's expulsion of Russian diplomats or closing Russian properties following the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election. They asked him if he had encouraged Kislyak not to retaliate.\n\n\"Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.' It wasn't, 'Don't do anything,' \" the memo said.\n\nBut the FBI knew that Flynn had asked Russia on that call not to escalate its response to the US.\n\nThat call came among a series of phone calls between Flynn and Trump officials, including some who were at Mar-a-Lago along with the President-elect. Those calls between Trump advisers and Flynn were revealed in Flynn's charging document and not described in the January 2017 FBI memo released Monday.\n\nFlynn made the calls around Christmas 2016 from the Dominican Republic, where he was vacationing with his wife. Kislyak had texted Flynn on December 28, 2016, asking him to call, which set off the series of calls in the following days.\n\nThe FBI memo also describes Flynn's interactions with Russian officials, trips to the country and the relationship he developed with Kislyak through when he became national security adviser. Those events date back to 2013, when he was the first Defense Intelligence Agency director to visit the Russian military intelligence headquarters, and another visit years later.\n\nTwice in late 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to express condolences, after the assassination of a Russian ambassador in Turkey and the crash of a Russian military plane.\n\n\"Flynn does not know if Putin and Trump will get along, but it is Flynn's job to figure out paths to work with Russia to fight terrorism,\" the FBI memo said.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Japan says it will have first aircraft carriers since WWII", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/7_48wGxglIQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "Tokyo (CNN) Japan is poised to put its first aircraft carriers to sea since World War II, refitting its Izumo-class warships to carry US-designed F-35B fighter jets, the government announced Tuesday.\n\nIn its 10-year Defense Program Guidelines, Tokyo said it will buy 42 of the stealthy F-35Bs, which are designed for short-run take offs and vertical landings.\n\nThose planes will be available for deployment aboard two flat-top ships, the JS Izumo and JS Kaga, which at more than 800 feet long and displacing 27,000 tons are the largest ships in the Japanese fleet.\n\n\"Under the drastically changing security environment around Japan, the government will take all possible measures to protect the lives and assets of Japanese people,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday in announcing the plan.\n\n\"The review of the new defense guideline is extremely meaningful to show the Japanese people and the world what is truly necessary in our defense to protect the people and to serve as the cornerstone of the future (for the Japan Self-Defense Forces).\"\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Life in jail over Gandhi assassination riots", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/qWFALtmmL8M/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:05", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An Indian court has sentenced a former politician to life in prison for inciting anti-Sikh violence in riots after the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi which claimed thousands of lives.\n\nSajjan Kumar was a key leader of Gandhi's then-ruling Congress Party when she was gunned down by two of her Sikh bodyguards.

But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Mom of child on life support can't see him because of Trump's travel ban, group says", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/FIfoVowVHog/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The family of a 2-year-old boy on life support is working with the US State Department to get an expedited visa for his mother so she can see him one last time.\n\nAbdullah Hassan is suffering from a genetic brain condition.

His family contends the air rifle was in a plastic bag, but the bag blew off as he walked home.\n\nJermaine McBean stands with his grandmother at his graduation in June 2007 at New York's Pace University.\n\nSomeone called 911 to report McBean walking around with what appeared to be a gun. Peraza and two other deputies arrived behind him and commanded him to stop, but McBean kept walking. His family said he kept walking because he was wearing ear buds and listening to music.\n\nWhat happened next is in dispute.\n\nIn a pretrial evidentiary hearing, a judge found that McBean, after walking into his apartment complex with the deputies still behind him, brought the air rifle over his head, turned toward the deputies and pointed the gun at them.\n\nPeraza, perceiving the rifle was being aimed at him, fired his gun three times and shot McBean twice, killing him, the trial judge found.\n\nHis family, citing at least one witness, contended that McBean never pointed the gun, but rather always had the gun cradled in his arms behind his head, across his shoulders, while the officers were behind him. The gun still was cradled in this way when McBean was shot as he turned to see what was happening behind him, the family contends.\n\nThe trial judge rejected the witness' testimony, and resolved factual disputes in favor of Peraza's arguments of self defense.\n\nThe case never went to trial because Peraza argued, and the judge agreed, that he should be granted pretrial immunity through Florida's \"stand your ground\" self-defense law.\n\nDifference between 'stand your ground' and police self-defense\n\nThe \"stand your ground\" law says \"a person\" is justified in using deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, or to prevent a forcible felony.\n\nAnd, the law says, the person using deadly force does not have to retreat, and indeed has the \"right to stand his or her ground\" if he or she \"is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.\"\n\nCritically in Peraza's case, someone found to be using deadly force consistently with that law is generally \" immune from criminal prosecution and civil action ,\" Florida statutes say. For a prosecution to happen, a prosecutor has to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" the shooter is not entitled to this immunity.\n\nFlorida law also provides a self-defense case for police specifically. It says officers cans use any force they reasonably believe to be necessary to defend against bodily harm while making an arrest.\n\nThe police law also says officers don't have to retreat from efforts to make a lawful arrest because of resistance.\n\nBut the police-specific law doesn't allow pretrial immunity from prosecution when facts are in dispute.\n\nWhen the trial judge granted Peraza immunity, the state appealed, arguing Peraza's wasn't eligible for \"stand your ground\" immunity because police have their own justifiable-force law.\n\nFlorida's Fourth District Court of Appeals sided with Peraza, but noted that a different appeals court previously ruled against a different police officer's claim. So, the Fourth District asked the Florida Supreme Court to resolve the issue.\n\nThat led to Thursday's ruling.\n\n\"Put simply, an officer is a 'person,' whether on duty or off, and irrespective of whether the officer is making an arrest,\" Florida Supreme Court Justice Alan Lawson wrote, referring to who the \"stand your ground\" statute covers as written.\n\n'Groundbreaking' for police, lawyer says\n\nPeraza's attorney, Eric Schwartzreich, said this is the first time a police officer has successfully used \"stand your ground\" in defense of a manslaughter or homicide allegation.\n\n\"I think it is groundbreaking,\" Schwartzreich said. \"This allows police to go to work without fear that they're going to be indicted (wrongfully).\"\n\nHe said Peraza \"never should have been indicted.\" Peraza was suspended after his indictment, but has been back at work with the sheriff's department since the Fourth District appellate decision.\n\nThursday's ruling won't eliminate the use of the police-specific law, said Jeffrey Swartz, a former Florida judge who now is a law professor at the Tampa Bay campus of Western Michigan University's Cooley Law School.\n\n\"Reliance on (the police self-defense law) to justify the actions of the officer in the initial investigative and charging decision stages will still play an important role,\" Swartz wrote to CNN in an email. \"Officers, their counsel and the unions that support them will still argue to state attorneys and investigators the facts of the case to prevent the charges being brought in the first place.\"\n\nIf an officer is charged, and if a court denies \"stand your ground\" immunity and the officer must go to trial, \"the use of (the police-specific law) in conjunction with self-defense theories will still be relevant,\" Swartz wrote Friday.\n\nA critic of the \"stand your ground\" law, University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks, said the high court's ruling itself was not surprising, because the law affords immunity to any \"person\" acting in self-defense, and police officers indisputably are people.\n\nBut, she wrote in an email to CNN on Friday, the ruling \"only lays bare the heart of this problem: It overwhelmingly serves the interest of those who already have the law on their side.\"\n\n\"It is clear, after more than a decade of 'stand your ground' in Florida, that the law is affirmatively evil,\" she wrote. \"It encourages people, including police officers, to use deadly force as a first rather than a last defense, with entirely predictable consequences: a steady increase in preventable and unnecessary deaths and a culture of cowardice and impunity.\n\n\"Police officers already kill members of the public, and particularly minority men, at alarming rates, with little or no consequences. The last thing they need is more encouragement to do so.\"\n\nThe Florida Attorney General's Office didn't immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on the ruling.\n\n'An absolute disgrace'\n\nMcBean's family is pursuing a civil lawsuit against Peraza, the two deputies who were with him and the county sheriff in federal court. The suit argues in part that McBean couldn't hear the deputies' commands because he was listening to music, that he didn't point the air rifle, and that he was wrongfully shot.\n\nThe family attorney, David Schoen, said Peraza's immunity from criminal prosecution \"is an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nSchoen said the indictment should have led to a criminal trial. In the 30 years preceding the case, more than 160 people had been killed by police officers in Broward County, but no officer had been indicted.\n\nPeraza's indictment shows \"how serious and how clear-cut this case was,\" Schoen said.\n\nHe noted that the Florida Supreme Court, in upholding the immunity, was bound by the trial judge's determination of facts\n\nLeaving such decisions in one judge's hands without a trial is dangerous, he said.\n\n\"The implications are huge. It's a slap in the face to every honest police officer,\" Schoen said. \"If ... the grand jury hears all the evidence and indicts him, the case should go to trial. Let the trial jury decide if he's entitled to claim (a police officer's self defense).\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Couple inspires Mattel to consider creating a same-sex Barbie wedding set", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/WFrh_PhSTrY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) They just wanted to give their niece a toy that matched their reality, but their makeshift doll set may be on its way to bringing more diversity to toy aisles everywhere.\n\n\"They look exactly like you,\" Natalie, 8, shouted with excitement when she opened the same-sex couple doll set her uncles gave her.\n\nMatt Jacobi and Nick Caprio, of Scottsdale, Arizona, have been a couple for more than 11 years, and they're planning a May wedding, with their two nieces as flower girls.\n\nNatalie, one of the girls, was celebrating her birthday on December 8, and because she loves dolls, her uncles were hoping to get her a doll wedding set.\n\nMatt Jacobi, right, and fianc\u00e9 Nick Caprio want stores to carry doll wedding sets that represent the LGBT community.\n\n\"We really wanted to give her something that she could enjoy, but also something that would be meaningful to her and somehow connected to the wedding she will be a part of,\" Jacobi said.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Mueller releases memo summarizing FBI's interview with Michael Flynn", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Ln4DKz4h1gw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller has released a January 2017 memo detailing the FBI's interview that month with Michael Flynn -- a moment that led to a high-profile criminal case against the former Trump national security adviser.\n\nIn the interview described in the memo, Flynn lied about his contact during the presidential transition in 2016 with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. At times, Flynn offered the FBI agents more benign descriptions of what he and Kislyak had said about Russian policy.\n\nIn all, the newly released memo shows clear examples of Flynn denying he had made policy requests of Russia, and the agents prodding him toward fuller descriptions of the calls.\n\nThe release of the memo Monday night -- on the eve of Flynn's criminal sentencing for lying to investigators -- sets up a clearer picture of what he said to the FBI agents in January 2017. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in that interview and about his lobbying for the Turkish government. He will likely face zero to six months in prison, though Mueller's team has asked the judge to give him no prison time because he has helped their investigation, along with other federal probes.\n\nWhether the FBI decided Flynn was lying at that moment has become a touch point in President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Mueller investigation. Trump has latched on to whether Mueller pursued Flynn on a criminal charge at odds with the FBI's initial findings. Former FBI agent Peter Strzok's participation in the Flynn interview -- and the fact that Flynn was not warned he could be prosecuted for lying and had no lawyer in the room with him when he met with the FBI at the White House -- has also cast political shadows on the case.\n\nTrump has alleged the FBI determined that day that Flynn hadn't lied. Yet the memo from January 24, 2017, that was released Monday night does not say the FBI agents made any determinations at that time. The memo only outlines what Flynn said in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe subsequent criminal complaint, filed by Mueller's office in December 2017, outlined how Flynn's retelling of the conversations was wrong.\n\nA memo released by Mueller's office last week described how the FBI had known the facts of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak before the agency approached him in the West Wing. A separate memo filed with the court last week summarized how Strzok recalled he \"had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.\"\n\nTwo lies\n\nThe memo describes how Flynn downplayed the approach he had taken in his discussions with Kislyak when FBI agents asked about the discussions in the January 2017 interview. He told the agents that \"no,\" he had not sought to influence Russia's vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution about Israeli settlements.\n\nBut investigators knew, according to charging documents filed last year, that Flynn had asked for Russia to vote against or delay the resolution.\n\nFlynn's second lie, as described in the FBI memo, came in response to the agents asking him about the US's expulsion of Russian diplomats or closing Russian properties following the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election. They asked him if he had encouraged Kislyak not to retaliate.\n\n\"Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.' It wasn't, 'Don't do anything,' \" the memo said.\n\nBut the FBI knew that Flynn had asked Russia on that call not to escalate its response to the US.\n\nThat call came among a series of phone calls between Flynn and Trump officials, including some who were at Mar-a-Lago along with the President-elect. Those calls between Trump advisers and Flynn were revealed in Flynn's charging document and not described in the January 2017 FBI memo released Monday.\n\nFlynn made the calls around Christmas 2016 from the Dominican Republic, where he was vacationing with his wife. Kislyak had texted Flynn on December 28, 2016, asking him to call, which set off the series of calls in the following days.\n\nThe FBI memo also describes Flynn's interactions with Russian officials, trips to the country and the relationship he developed with Kislyak through when he became national security adviser. Those events date back to 2013, when he was the first Defense Intelligence Agency director to visit the Russian military intelligence headquarters, and another visit years later.\n\nTwice in late 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to express condolences, after the assassination of a Russian ambassador in Turkey and the crash of a Russian military plane.\n\n\"Flynn does not know if Putin and Trump will get along, but it is Flynn's job to figure out paths to work with Russia to fight terrorism,\" the FBI memo said.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Mueller memo summarizing FBI's interview with Michael Flynn", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/0j1uHU35fk0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: Retired Army Lt.

One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.\n\nBut the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.\n\nAn impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.\n\nYet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.\n\nA fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.\n\nObamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.\n\nAnd the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.\n\nThe President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility.\n\nWhite House 'absolutely' ready for a shutdown\n\nThe possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.\n\n\"We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,\" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nAsked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, \"If it comes to it, absolutely.\"\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.\n\n\"President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,\" Schumer said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nSigns that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January.\n\nNew trouble for Obamacare\n\nAmericans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.\n\nThe move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.\n\nImmediate legal opinion \u2014 even from some conservatives \u2014 suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.\n\nThe decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.\n\nBut Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.\n\n\"I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,\" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle.\n\nSwamp creatures\n\nTrump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.\n\nPossible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.\n\nMulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.\n\n\"He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,\" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nStill, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year.\n\nRussia to overshadow Trump's Christmas\n\nTrump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.\n\nThe President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.\n\nCooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.\n\nSpeculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.\n\nThings are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on \"State of the Union\" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.\n\nThere were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.\n\nSince his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Comey blasts Trump over tweet about FBI raid of Michael Cohen's office", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/JCR_XuBYLhE/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey slammed President Donald Trump for a tweet Sunday accusing the FBI of breaking into the office of his former attorney, Michael Cohen, earlier this year and called on Republicans to speak out in defense of the agency.\n\n\"This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge,\" Comey tweeted Sunday afternoon. \"Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment \u2014 for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth.\"\n\nTrump had lashed out at his estranged former attorney and the FBI in a series of tweets that blasted the Russia investigation.\n\n\"Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started,\" Trump tweeted . \"They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!

But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teen vaping continues to rise while other drug use declines, survey finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/SzhAf6dLfsw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Vaping among America's teenagers continues to climb, while the use of other substances -- such as alcohol and opioids -- has declined in recent years, according to a new report.\n\nMonday's report, called Monitoring the Future , comes from the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and is based on an annual survey of drug and alcohol use and attitudes among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders in the United States. This year's survey included 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools across the country.\n\nBehind drinking alcohol, vaping was the second-most common form of substance use, the study showed, with 17.6% of eighth-graders, 32.3% of 10th-graders and 37.3% of 12th-graders reporting vaping in the past year. Last year, the annual survey found that prevalence of vaping was 13.3% among eighth-graders, 23.9% among 10th-graders and 27.8% among 12th-graders.\n\nVaping involves using an electronic cigarette , hookah or similar device to inhale certain vapors or aerosols, which could contain substances such as nicotine, marijuana or flavoring.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a change in the patterns of drug taking among teenagers in that they are the lowest that we've seen for many years,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have very good news,\" she said, \"but at the same time, we have to be vigilant, because of this very high uptake and embracing of vaping by teenagers that could lead them then to the administration of other drugs.\"\n\nVaping: 'A real problem'\n\nThis year is the second in which the Monitoring the Future survey asked high schoolers about vaping specific substances: nicotine, marijuana or \"just flavoring.\"\n\nFlavoring was the most commonly reported substance among eighth-graders at 15.1%, followed by nicotine at 10.9% and then marijuana at 4.4%.\n\nTenth-graders reported identical rates for flavoring and nicotine, but 12.4% reported vaping marijuana. Among 12th-graders, 29.7% reported vaping nicotine, 25.7% flavoring and 13.1% marijuana.\n\n\"You're seeing right now that 30% of 12th-graders last year were exposed to nicotine,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"Another issue of concern is, these devices are very efficient at delivering drugs rapidly into your brain and, in so doing, deliver the drugs in ways that make them more addictive -- and so it's not just nicotine. Now we also know that they are using it for 9THC,\" or tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid chemical in marijuana, she said.\n\n\"However, since MTF doesn't appear to separate out vaping vs. Juuling in their survey, it is hard to know what the youth are using,\" Halpern-Felsher said of the new report.\n\n\"The overall decline or stabilization of other drug use is promising, although the increase in vaping marijuana is concerning,\" she said. \"Clearly, youth drug prevention messages needs to go beyond conventional drugs and include all forms of nicotine and vaping.\"\n\nThe overall increase in vaping in the survey appears to be consistent with data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a 78% increase in youth vaping between 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Pamela Ling, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco , who works with the school's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and was not involved with the new report.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration \"has also recognized an 'epidemic' of youth vaping. The consistency of these data suggests this is a real problem,\" Ling said.\n\n\"While we see declines in cigarette smoking among youth, the increases in vaping may lead to overall rates of tobacco or nicotine use increasing. We also know from many longitudinal studies of youth that those who use e-cigarettes are about three times more likely to start smoking cigarettes ,\" she said. \"The increase in vaping goes against the trends for all other drugs and alcohol, which are declining. That's a problem.\"\n\nIn historical context, \"the absolute increases in the prevalence of nicotine vaping among 12th-graders and 10th-graders are the largest ever recorded by Monitoring the Future in the 44 years that it has continuously tracked dozens of substances,\" the authors of the report wrote in a letter to the editor Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional use of cigarettes remained at the lowest levels in the survey's history.\n\nDaily cigarette use was reported by 0.8% of eighth-graders, 1.8% of 10th-graders and 3.6% of 12th-graders in 2018, the survey showed. Lifetime cigarette use among 12th-graders went down from 26.6% in 2017 to 23.8% in 2018, and past-month use declined from 9.7% to 7.6%.\n\nIn general, substances at historic low levels of use in 2018 were alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, prescription opioids, MDMA (ecstasy or Molly), methamphetamine, amphetamines, sedatives and ketamine, according to the report.\n\nAlcohol and opioid use dropping among teens\n\nEven though alcohol and binge drinking rates appeared to be on the decline, alcohol was still \"the most frequently used substance\" in the report, Volkow said.\n\nPast-month use of alcohol was reported by 8.2%, 18.6% and 30.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the survey. Yet the percentage of teenagers who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" Volkow said.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Why are opioids so addictive? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why are opioids so addictive? 00:55\n\nThe new report also showed a significant drop over the past five years in the percentage of teenagers, particularly 12th-graders, using opioids despite the ongoing epidemic among adults in the United States\n\n\"It's fascinating that despite the fact that we have very high rates of opioids and heroin among adults, adolescents have the lowest rates that we have seen since the inception of the survey,\" Volkow said.\n\nFor instance, Vicodin use dropped by 58.4% in eighth-graders, 75.4% in 10th-graders and 67.2% in 12th-graders over the past five years, according to the report.\n\nThe survey also showed a shift in how easy teens think opioid drugs are to access.\n\nOne in three 12th-graders, or 32.5%, said in this year's report that prescription opioids were easily available, compared with more than 54.2% in 2010.\n\n\"Intriguingly, when they go off to college or go to work, you see the highest rates of opioid use among 18 to 24 years of age. So there is a big gap between the patterns of consumptions of opioids in teenagers and then when they go into young adulthood,\" Volkow said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe added that the difficulty youths face in accessing opioid drugs could explain this stark difference in use between teenagers and young adults.\n\n\"I think many of the campaigns that are trying to make it harder to get access to prescription opioids have had an effect,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"This has been decreasing the number of prescription opioids given in our country, of the number of tablets given, and as a result of that, there are less tablets in parents' cabinets, and they are actually harder to get even in the black market,\" she said.\n\n\"Also, perhaps educational campaigns about the high risk of overdoses that are associated with the use of these substances, and the high risk of addiction to these substances, all of these factors may have had a positive impact (on) teenagers.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Check your fridge and pantry for food products recalled this week", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/PuVurUELcBs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Before the family gathers for a holiday meal, here's all the food you should purge from your pantry.

Some people encourage her to \"calm down\" and \"keep it quiet.\" Others scold her for wearing a mini-skirt. One man accuses her of being a drug addict.\n\nManal is an actor in a social experiment organized by the Lebanese women's rights group ABAAD last month. During the nine or so hours when Manal emulated a rape victim, not a single bystander called the police.\n\nThe aim of the experiment -- part of a weeks-long campaign called #ShameOnWho -- was to expose the stigma attached to rape victims, activists say.\n\n\"In general, people think that she's the loose one, she's the one to blame and she's the one who should be held accountable,\" says ABAAD's founder Ghida Anani.\n\n\"We're trying to encourage women who are survivors of rape to speak up, to get out from the cycle and culture of victim-blaming,\" says Anani.\n\nA women's rights protester holds a #ShameOnWho campaign banner at Beirut's yearly marathon this November.\n\nDespite concerted movements by Lebanese civil society to tackle gender-based violence, the problem is growing. In 1994, 30% of women in Lebanon said they experienced some form of violence, according to United Nations figures. Today that figure is closer to 60%, according to data compiled by ABAAD from various ministries, the police and media reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if the increase in claims is due to a greater willingness to report the violence or an actual rise in the number of attacks or a mix of both, Anani says.\n\nBut activists have pushed hard against the trend. Awareness campaigns promoting gender equity are prominent and hard-hitting, and activists have kept up sustained pressure on government to introduce legislation to protect women.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon's parliament passed its first-ever law criminalizing domestic violence. In 2017, it repealed a legal loophole that acquitted rapists who marry their victims. Still, Lebanon's penal code has some way to go. No minimum legal age for marriage exists in the country and marital rape remains legal.\n\nSpeaking up\n\nIn five Beirut locations, artists volunteering with ABAAD have painted black and white murals of rapists' faces, sketched out from the memories of the survivors.\n\n\"These are wanted men,\" says Anani. \"Today, the spotlight should be on the people who are doing this kind of behavior and not those who are subject to it.\"\n\nNot yet willing to step out of the shadows, survivors are speaking out through artists and activists.\n\nOne woman, identified as Reham, recorded her story on an audio file. Reham was repeatedly sexually assaulted by her older brother from the age of 8 to 28. When she finally spoke up, her mother called her a \"liar.\"\n\nSitting on a chair in a sparsely furnished room, actress Hiba Sleiman listens to Reham's recording through an ear piece, retelling the moment of confrontation between mother and daughter.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to tell you how she tore off my hijab, how she tore off my clothes and inspected me from head to toe while she beat me and insulted me repeatedly. When it was over, I said 'did you get what you wanted?' ... I carried my torn clothes and cried and screamed, and cried and screamed. And nobody heard me.\"\n\nHiba describes audiences going from room to room at Zico House, a cultural center in Beirut, listening to six actors tell survivors' stories as part of an immersive play, organized by #ShameOnWho.\n\n\"It was moving. It was intense. A lot of people cried. Some people couldn't watch all of the scenes. Some people walked out of specific scenes in the middle of them,\" says Hiba.\n\nFigures representing women killed by male relatives in Lebanon during a rally organized by the women's rights group KAFA this January.\n\n\"We don't have the space for telling these stories so often. We hear these stories on Facebook, or on TV but we never really encounter these people in our lives.\"\n\nBut Lebanon's civil society appears determined to give women a larger platform and counter social practices perceived as sexist.\n\nLast month, women's rights activists called for the boycott of the television channel MTV Lebanon after it aired an interview with Mohammed al-Nheily, the husband and convicted killer of 33-year-old Manal Assi, in a program on Lebanese prisoners called Out of Freedom. Activists criticized what they said was an overly sympathetic portrayal of the man who bludgeoned Assi to death. In his tearful interview, Nheily said he \"regretted\" the 2014 murder and longed to \"turn back time so that neither (he) nor Manal had done wrong.\"\n\nThe episode also featured an actress depicting Manal from beyond the grave, urging non-profit organizations and lawyers to \"stop speaking on her behalf\" and suggesting that the murder could have been avoided if only she and Mohammed had \"talked about (their) feelings.\"\n\n\"It is clear beyond doubt that the aim of this episode -- however much you deny it -- was to justify the murder by having the interview focus on the anger that possessed Mohammed Al-Nheily,\" wrote women's rights group KAFA in a Facebook post addressing MTV.\n\n\"The case was summed up as a crime in which both parties bore equal responsibility,\" it added.\n\nMTV said it gave Nheily \"the same treatment\" as previous prisoners it interviewed in Out of Freedom.\n\n\"The program gave an opportunity to the killer of Manal al-Assi to speak in the same way that it gave an opportunity to 90 prisoners before him. They all provided the reasons and circumstances that led them to commit the different crimes, including domestic crimes,\" said the program's presenter Samir Youssef in a statement to CNN.\n\n\"The case of Manal Assi coincided with the efforts of non-profit organizations to develop women's rights laws. So, it was natural that this episode would have caused reactions, especially since the murderer Mohamad al-Nheily was speaking to the media for the first time since he committed the crime.\"\n\nShamed into silence\n\n\"I called it a rape of my rights,\" says one woman, who requests anonymity to avoid personal repercussions.\n\nShe says an ex-lover once secretly videotaped a sexual encounter between them and blackmailed her with it.\n\nShe says he threatened to send the sex tape to her colleagues and family.\n\n\"He said ... 'I'm going to send it to the whole society for them to see what a bad person you are,'\" the woman recalls.\n\nFor two months, the woman cried herself to sleep until she mustered the courage to confront her harasser.\n\n\"I told him 'you can show the video to whoever you want ... This is my body and I'm free to do whatever I want. I'm free to sleep with whoever I want,\" she says.\n\nShortly after that, she had the video deleted after one of her male friends took her harasser's phone away from him.\n\nWomen hold placards denouncing domestic violence during a rally on the \"International Women's Day\" on March 8, 2014 in front of the National Museum in the capital Beirut.\n\nThroughout her ordeal, she never resorted to the police or her family. \"They would have told me it was my fault for going to the hotel with him, for being so easy, for doing whatever I felt like doing,\" she says.\n\nStill unable to drop the veil of anonymity, she nevertheless calls on other women to \"face their fears.\"\n\n\"We should always know we are victims, we are not the ones who did wrong. The ones who did wrong are the ones who failed to gain our trust.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Gun deaths in US reach highest level in nearly 40 years, CDC data reveals", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/WXP7yEI9Td0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Nearly 40,000 people in the United States died by guns last year, marking the highest number of gun deaths in decades, according to a new analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER database.\n\nA similar analysis was first conducted by the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence , a non-profit gun policy advocacy group.\n\nCNN replicated that analysis and found that 39,773 people died by guns in 2017, which is an increase of more than 10,000 deaths from the 28,874 in 1999.

About 19 million people use one each year.\n\nSome banks also have unarranged overdrafts, with extra or higher charges for going beyond this limit or going into the red without permission, used by 14 million people a year.\n\nPrevious research by the FCA has shown that overdrafts are lucrative for banks, generating an estimated \u00a32.4bn in revenues in 2017.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nOverdrafts in numbers\n\nThose aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft\n\nA total of 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the last 12 months\n\nSource: FCA, Financial Lives, October 2017\n\nFor customers, the charges and fees are difficult to compare - with a mix of interest rates, daily fees, or monthly fees among banks. Those costs could be high even with a small debt. For example, someone could be charged \u00a35 a day for borrowing \u00a3100 overdraft.\n\nThe majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers. They paid about \u00a3450 a year in fees and charges, the FCA said.\n\nOn average, consumers in more deprived areas paid twice as much in charges for unarranged overdrafts than consumers living in less deprived areas, the FCA found.\n\nWhat is the regulator suggesting?\n\nThe overdraft system would be overhauled, in what the FCA calls the \"biggest intervention in the overdraft market for a generation\".\n\nInstead of arranged and unarranged overdrafts, the regulator is proposing a simple, single interest rate for customers going into an overdraft.\n\nThere would no longer be any monthly or daily fees - like the ones charged to Mrs Toth.\n\nUnder the plans, banks would have to advertise their overdraft rate as a single annual interest rate, or APR.\n\nA series of alerts and calculators would have to be offered to customers, and banks must identify anyone who looks as though they are getting into financial trouble and help them.\n\nBanks will still be able to refuse to make a payment if a customer does not have the funds to cover it, but any resulting fee for the customer must reflect that cost.\n\nAndrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said: \"It is clear to us that the way banks manage and charge for overdrafts needed fundamental reform.\"\n\nHe added that the FCA's \"radical\" proposals would \"make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage\".\n\nWill overdrafts become cheaper?\n\nThe FCA wants the changes to come into force by April, after which it would expect banks to start competing on their overdraft rate.\n\nThat could push down the cost, if customers choose to move their current account provider as a result.\n\nHowever, analyst Andrew Hagger, from Moneycomms, said that \"the end of free banking could become much more of a reality because of this move\" because banks could start charging a monthly fee to everyone with a current account.\n\nHe said: \"It will be interesting to see how the banks react - will they charge sky high interest rates for overdrafts, instead of hiding behind complex tariffs or will they look to recoup lost revenue by charging monthly fees?\"\n\nWhy not simply cap the cost of overdrafts?\n\nThe FCA is no stranger to price caps. It is introducing a rule for so-called rent-to-own products that means, from April 2019, customers will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself.\n\nCampaigners have said a cap on the cost of payday loans, introduced by the FCA in 2015, should be a template for overdrafts. Other sectors - such as energy - have seen price caps brought in.\n\nHowever, financial regulators have a chequered history when attempting to put a cap on overdraft charges.\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court overturned earlier court rulings that allowed the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the fairness of charges for unauthorised overdrafts. In effect, this halted more than a million claims from bank customers for refunds of unarranged overdraft fees.\n\nHave you had problems with bank overdrafts and debt?

You would be encouraged to use it but not be forced to do so.\n\nThe introduction of food waste containers may mean getting your main rubbish bin emptied less often.\n\nYou would have to pay a bit extra as a deposit on drinks containers, including coffee cups. You would get the deposit back if and when you recycled it.\n\nYou may have to be more careful which trader you employ to get rid of your old fridge or unwanted mattress - because they could be electronically tracked to ensure they do not dump it.\n\nThe goods that you buy may last longer and be more easily repaired, if government plans are effective.\n\nHow are people reacting to the plans?\n\nLibby Peake from the Green Alliance responded: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good in the policy \u2013 it\u2019s on the right lines. But we need to see the detail of exactly how things will work.\u201d\n\nShe, and others, worry that major retailers will persuade the government during its consultation phase to exclude large drinks bottles from the deposit return scheme.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium says most of the problem with beach litter is \u201con-the-go\u201d containers, not one litre bottles from supermarkets.\n\nThey also fear the cost of installing the \u201creverse vending\u201d machines that pay people for returning their containers.\n\nShadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said: \"You can't aim to prevent fly tipping without ending cuts to the councils. And we need a plan for stopping the export of UK recycling and waste plastics to countries where they currently end up in landfill or polluting our oceans.\n\n\"Rather than a vision for building our recycling infrastructure, it talks about voluntary action and distant target deadlines, while talking up the value of more incinerators.\"\n\nCouncils fear that if aluminium cans are part of the deposit scheme they will no longer appear in household bins, where they are the most lucrative item for recycling.\n\nMartin Tett from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, welcomed plans for companies to pay the cost of recycling their products.\n\nHowever he warned: \"Moves to standardise waste services, including weekly food collections, need to be fully funded.\"\n\nSamantha Harding, from the green group CPRE, told BBC News she welcomed some proposals in the report. She said: \u201cSeparating food waste is essential \u2013 because decomposing food in general household bins reduces the value of other material sent for re-cycling.\u201d\n\nThere is some frustration among campaigners that key issues are still not tied down after many months of debate.\n\nBut sources suggest the Treasury is resisting measures that might increase costs, and industry is warning that rushed policies could backfire.\n\nToday\u2019s plans build on the Autumn Budget, which announced a world-leading tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content - subject to consultation.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter.\n\nWhat's your experience of recycling in your area?

It reduces muscle loss in the body, if you stay in bed too long you lose muscle mass.

It is second only to water as the most-consumed resource on the planet.\n\nBut, while cement - the key ingredient in concrete - has shaped much of our built environment, it also has a massive carbon footprint.\n\nCement is the source of about 8% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to think tank Chatham House.\n\nIf the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world - behind China and the US. It contributes more CO2 than aviation fuel (2.5%) and is not far behind the global agriculture business (12%).\n\nCement industry leaders were in Poland for the UN's climate change conference - COP24 - to discuss ways of meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change. To do this, annual emissions from cement will need to fall by at least 16% by 2030.\n\nSo, how did our love of concrete end up endangering the planet? And what can we do about it?\n\nIn praise of concrete\n\nAs the key building material of most tower blocks, car parks, bridges and dams, concrete has, for the haters, enabled the construction of some of the world's worst architectural eyesores.\n\nIn the UK, it helped the massive wave of post-World War Two development - much of it still dividing opinion - with several of the country's major cities, such as Birmingham, Coventry, Hull and Portsmouth, largely defined by the concrete structures from that building push.\n\nImage caption Birmingham is known for its concrete structures\n\nBut concrete is also the reason some of the world's most impressive buildings exist.\n\nSydney Opera House, the Lotus Temple in Delhi, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as well as the magnificent Pantheon in Rome - boasting the largest unsupported concrete dome in the world - all owe their form to the material.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The unreinforced concrete dome of the Pantheon in Rome has yet to be beaten in size\n\nA mix of sand and gravel, a cement binder and water, concrete is so widely embraced by architects, developers and builders because it is a remarkably good construction material.\n\n\"It's affordable, you can produce it almost anywhere and it has all the right structural qualities that you want to build with for a durable building or for infrastructure,\" explains Felix Preston, deputy research director at the Energy, Environment and Resources Department at Chatham House.\n\nDespite known durability problems with using steel reinforcement, which can crack concrete from the inside, it is still the go-to material across the world.\n\n\"Building without concrete, although it is possible, is challenging,\" says Mr Preston.\n\nGrowth of cement industry\n\nIt is these unrivalled attributes of concrete that have helped boost global cement production since the 1950s, with Asia and China accounting for the bulk of growth from the 1990s onwards.\n\nProduction has increased more than thirtyfold since 1950 and almost fourfold since 1990. China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US did in the entire 20th Century.\n\nBut with Chinese consumption now appearing to level off, most future growth in construction is expected to happen in the emerging markets of South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - driven by rapid urbanisation and economic development.\n\nThe floor area of the world's buildings is projected to double in the next 40 years, say Chatham House researchers, requiring cement production to increase by a quarter by 2030.\n\nConcrete has a long history\n\nImage copyright Leeds Library\n\nWhile many of us assume concrete is a recent addition to our cities, architects and builders have actually been using it for millennia.\n\nThe earliest use of concrete is believed to have been more than 8,000 years ago, with traders in Syria and Jordan creating concrete floors, buildings and underground cisterns.\n\nLater, the Romans were known to be masters of concrete, building the Pantheon in Rome in 113-125AD, with its 43m-diameter free-standing concrete dome the largest in the world.\n\nBut the concrete used in our modern-built environment owes much of its make-up to a process patented in the early 19th Century by bricklayer Joseph Aspdin of Leeds.\n\nHis new technique of roasting limestone and clay in an oven and then grinding it to a powder to make \"artificial stone\" is now known as Portland cement - still the key ingredient in almost all modern concrete.\n\nBut, despite its ubiquitous presence, concrete's environmental credentials have come under increased scrutiny in the last couple of decades.\n\nNot only does the production of Portland cement involve quarrying - causing airborne pollution in the form of dust - it also requires the use of massive kilns, which require large amounts of energy.\n\nThe actual chemical process of making cement also emits staggeringly high levels of CO2.\n\n'Action needed'\n\nThe sector has made progress - improvements in the energy-efficiency of new plants and burning waste materials instead of fossil fuels has seen the average CO2 emissions per tonne of output fall by 18% over the last few decades, according to Chatham House.\n\nThe newly-established Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), currently representing about 35% of the world's cement production capacity and with a focus on sustainable development, was at COP24.\n\nChief executive Benjamin Sporton says the fact the organisation now exists \"is a demonstration of the commitment of the industry to sustainability, including taking action on climate change\".\n\nThe GCCA is due to publish a set of sustainability guidelines, which its membership will have to follow.\n\n\"By bringing together global players to provide leadership and focus, as well as delivering a detailed work programme, we can help ensure a sustainable future for cement and concrete, and for the needs of future generations,\" Mr Sporton says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Shanghai, like many Chinese cities, has seen a rapid rise in development\n\nBut despite the promise, Chatham House argues that the industry is reaching the limits of what it can do with current measures.\n\nIf the sector has any hope of meeting its commitments to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, it will need to look at overhauling the cement-making process itself, not only reducing the use of fossil fuels.\n\n'Clinker' - the big polluter\n\nIt is the process of making \"clinker\" - the key constituent of cement - that emits the largest amount of CO2 in cement-making.\n\n1. Raw materials, mainly limestone and clay, are quarried and crushed\n\n2. They are ground and mixed with other materials - such as iron ore or ash\n\n3. They are fed into huge, cylindrical kilns and heated to about 1,450C (2,640F)\n\n4. The process of \"calcination\" splits the material into calcium oxide and CO2\n\n5. A new substance called clinker emerges as marble-sized grey balls\n\n6. The clinker is cooled, ground and mixed with gypsum and limestone\n\n7. The cement is transported to ready-mix concrete companies\n\nIn 2016, world cement production generated around 2.2 billion tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 8% of the global total. More than half of that came from the calcination process.\n\nTogether with thermal combustion, 90% of the sector's emissions could be attributed to the production of clinker.\n\nBecause of this, Mr Preston and his colleagues argue the sector urgently needs to pursue a number of CO2 reduction strategies.\n\nFurther efforts on energy efficiency, a move away from fossil fuels and pursuing carbon capture and storage will help, but can only do so much.\n\n\"We've got a long way to close the gap,\" Mr Preston says.\n\nWhat the industry really needs to do is plough efforts into producing new types of cement, he argues. In fact, low-carbon cements and \"novel cements\" might do away with the need for clinker altogether.\n\nNew cements\n\nOne of those trying to drum up greater support for such alternative cements is Ginger Krieg Dosier, co-founder and CEO of BioMason - a start-up in North Carolina that uses trillions of bacteria to grow bio-concrete bricks.\n\nThe technique, which involves placing sand in moulds and injecting it with microorganisms, initiates a process similar to the one that creates coral.\n\n\"I have a long fascination with marine cements and structures,\" explains Ms Krieg Dosier, a trained architect who was surprised to find no real green alternatives to bricks and masonry when she began research at an architectural firm more than 10 years ago.\n\nThe discovery led her to create her own solution, which, after years of development, now takes only four days. It happens at room temperature, without the need for fossil fuels or calcination - two of the main sources of the cement industry's CO2 emissions.\n\nMs Krieg Dosier believes green cements and technologies such as hers offer a solution to the sector's emissions issue.\n\n\"Traditional Portland-based cement production practices will continue to release CO2 due to its fundamental chemistry,\" she says, adding that rather than turning to carbon capture and storage, we should be investing more in techniques that actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n\"Alternative cements and binding technologies go beyond evolutionary CO2 capture to revolutionary methods that fundamentally sequester CO2.\"\n\n'Disruptive forces'\n\nAlongside such alternative cements, other \"disruptive\" forces are also beginning to drive change. Digitalisation, machine learning and an increasing awareness of sustainability are all having an impact on the cement industry's culture.\n\n\"It's partly changing because of how people want to live, but also because of our ability to dream up new and innovative structures and test those with computer models,\" says Mr Preston. \"There's also the ability to build things more cheaply with robots - with automation.\"\n\nBut changing processes quickly enough to meet the cement industry's obligations will be a challenge.\n\nImage copyright BioMason Image caption Bio-cement start-up BioMason grows bricks out of sand and bacteria\n\nThe sector is dominated by a small number of major producers who are reluctant to experiment or change business models. Architects, engineers, contractors and clients are also, rather understandably, cautious about using new building materials.\n\n\"This quite slow-moving, difficult-to-change sector is starting to bump against these quite profound disruptions that we're starting to see in the built environment,\" says Mr Preston.\n\nBut, with very few low-carbon cements reaching commercialisation, and none being applied at scale in an industry where bigger and taller is often the ambition, it looks likely that sustained government support will be needed.\n\nWithout governments applying pressure on the industry or providing funding, it may not be possible to get the next generation of low-carbon cements out of the laboratory and into the market within the required timescale.\n\nAnd the timescale is ever-shrinking.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the leading international body on global warming - last month argued the global average temperature rise needed to be kept below 1.5C - not 2C as noted in the Paris Agreement. This means CO2 emissions need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.\n\nLike other young companies, Ms Krieg Dosier describes the difficulties of simultaneously developing and marketing her products and scaling up manufacturing processes to compete within the wider construction industry.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Concrete is the chosen material for most large-scale projects\n\nBut she thinks there are reasons to be optimistic.\n\n\"I do believe the construction industry is approaching a point where alternative materials will be more widely adopted,\" she says. \"This is in part due to market demand, other innovative technologies and wider concern for climate change.\"\n\nThe cement industry, too, points to more optimistic assessments of the industry's progress on emissions and suggests that, across its lifetime, concrete could make a net climate benefit when all possible action is taken into account.\n\nThis includes re-carbonation (or the re-absorption of CO2 by cement), concrete's contribution to the energy efficiency of buildings, and innovation in the way cement is manufactured - including carbon capture and storage.\n\nThe GCCA says such innovation is its key priority in the months and years ahead. Projects are already underway and showing promise, it added.\n\nBut Mr Preston says it is imperative that governments and industry now act quickly at a time when global development is expected to rise but CO2 emissions need to fall.\n\n\"There's a desperate need for quality, affordable homes,\" he says. \"There's a need for new infrastructure. We can only square this circle if we can dramatically improve the way that we build, so that overall these buildings are constructed with, as close as possible, net zero emissions.\"\n\nDesign by Lilly Huynh."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "Maria Butina Pleads Guilty To Russian Scheme To Influence Conservatives", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/maria-butina-pleads-guilty-to-russian-scheme-to-influen-1831157633", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "In a deal with federal prosecutors, Maria Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent as part of a broader effort to incline notable members of the NRA and other conservatives towards Russia.

The conflict lasted nearly four years and took the lives of thousands of Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats.\n\nMarchers were protesting against a worsening rift between the three main nationalist parties sharing power in Bosnia-Herzegovina - the Muslim SDA, the Serb SDS and a branch of the Croatian HDZ.\n\nI felt safer when I came to the hotel than on the streets of Sarajevo ... but no, we didn't feel safe there [either]. There is no way we could have felt safe. Samir Koric, former Reuters translator and fixer\n\nAs the protesters reached the Vrbanja Bridge, snipers fired into the crowd killing two women: Sauda Deberovic and Olga Sosic. The next day, the number of protesters outside Parliament grew and Serb snipers began shooting into the crowds.\n\nSome of the snipers had been targeting people from inside the Holiday Inn hotel, which Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had made his temporary headquarters.\n\n\"Snipers who were using the hotel were facing the Parliament building. They were shooting at innocent people who gathered in front of the Parliament to protest against the war. That was a prelude to the war,\" recalls Hajro Rovcanin, who worked at the Holiday Inn from the start and is now the hotel's executive director.\n\nJournalists rushed to Sarajevo to cover the escalation of tensions, and although there was other more comfortable accommodation, the Holiday Inn soon became the centre of media coverage during the war. A significant amount video and still pictures of the war was filmed from the hotel.\n\n\"I think maybe the Holiday Inn became the war hotel in Sarajevo because of a kind of an accident but also by design. Because of its unique location in the centre of the city, almost like a fortress that you can look out from all the sides,\" recalls photographer Paul Lowe who was among hundreds of correspondents, photographers and crews that set up base in the Holiday Inn to cover the siege.\n\n\"It had infrastructure, it had a safe basement, safe garage, had plenty of rooms and somehow, we are not sure how, the hotel management to keep the supplies of food coming in ... So there was a sense that this being a concrete cocoon, which is completely false because people were shot dead on the entrance of the hotel,\" says Lowe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Holiday Inn was subjected to shelling and hit directly several times by heavy fire from Serb positions in the residential area of Grabvica and on Mount Trebevic. Eventually, parts of the hotel were uninhabitable due to destruction and shelling. And getting in and out of the hotel every day was extremely dangerous, remembers the BBC's Martin Bell.\n\n\"I thought to myself I've got a better chance to survive if I don't enter the hotel through the main door which is on the line of fire from the Serbs opposite, but walking in through the broken frontage,\" says Bell. \"I was always [to] walk to my room in the clockwise direction however long it took rather the anti-clock direction - and it sort of helped to keep me alive.\"\n\nThe main street between the hotel and the parliament became known as Sniper Alley, which was \"one of the most dangerous intersections in Sarajevo\" 25 years ago, according to Kenneth Morrison, Professor of Modern European History. \"Snipers were particularly active in this area.\"\n\nAccording to 1995 UN figures, 225 people were killed there and over a thousand injured.\n\n\"I spent a lot of time outside anyway. I felt safer when I came to the hotel than on the streets of Sarajevo, but no, we didn't feel safe. There is no way we could have felt safe,\" says Samir Koric, former Reuters translator and fixer.\n\nDespite the danger, the hotel continued to house the media until the siege was lifted on February 29, 1996 - following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the Bosnian conflict. More than 11,000 civilians had been killed.\n\nThe Holiday Inn still stands today, albeit under a new name, a symbol of the endurance and fortitude of the people of Sarajevo - and a shelter for those bringing their story to the world when the people of Sarajevo needed them the most.\n\nLead image: Paul Lowe\n\nSource: Al Jazeera"}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Trump travel ban keeps Yemeni mother from seeing dying son in US", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/trump-travel-ban-yemeni-mother-dying-son-181218072328444.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:15", "body_paragraphs": "Two-year-old Abdullah Hassan is dying in a California hospital, but his Yemeni mother cannot travel to the United States to say goodbye to him.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Run-up to Flynn Sentencing Tinged with Unexpected Drama", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/run-up-to-flynn-sentencing-tinged-with-unexpected-drama/4705239.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Flynn may have given extraordinary cooperation to prosecutors, but the run-up to his sentencing hearing Tuesday has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which the former national security adviser lied about his Russian contacts.\n\n\n\nFlynn's lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie. Prosecutors shot back, \"He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.\"\n\n\n\nThe mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time. The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.\n\n\n\n\"It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge \u2014 and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,\" said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.\n\n\n\nUntil the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn \u2014 who pleaded guilty to lying about conversations during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador \u2014 was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.\n\nProsecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.\n\n\n\nFlynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.\n\n\n\nThen came his sentencing memo.\n\n\n\nAlthough Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI. They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents \u2014 rather than involve lawyers.\n\n\n\nThey also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.\n\n\n\nMueller's team has rejected any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in a sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.\n\n\n\n\"A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, \"They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.\"\n\nTrump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them. He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a \"great person\" and asserting erroneously last week that the FBI said he didn't lie.\n\n\n\nFlynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.\n\n\n\nArun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's \"inconsistent\" with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.\n\n\n\n\"You also wonder in this very unusual situation,\" he said, \"whether it is a play for a pardon.\"\n\n\n\nIt's possible at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview. That included portions of the notes from Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 interview with FBI agents.\n\n\n\nResponding to Sullivan's order, prosecutors filed a redacted copy of the FBI interview notes Monday evening. The notes show FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his Russian contacts, including past trips to the country and his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the U.S.\n\n\n\nLast year, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about the contents of his conversations with Kislyak during the presidential transition.\n\n\n\nThe notes show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak not to escalate Russia's response to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over election interference. But Flynn admitted as part of his guilty plea that he did.\n\nThe notes also show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution involving Israeli settlements. But last year he admitted having asked Kislyak to see if Russia would vote against or delay the resolution. Court papers show Flynn made the request at the direction of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\n\n\nSullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, \"I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.\"\n\n\n\nIn an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the experience inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n\nBut while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.\n\n\n\n\"To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap \u2014 it's an absurd allegation,\" he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "GOP Waits on Trump as Clock Ticks Toward Partial Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gop-waits-on-trump-as-clock-ticks-toward-partial-shutdown/4705250.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "The fight over President Donald Trump's $5 billion wall funds deepened Monday, threatening a partial government shutdown in a standoff that has become increasingly common in Washington.\n\nIt wasn't always like this, with Congress and the White House at a crisis over government funding. The House and Senate used to pass annual appropriation bills, and the president signed them into law. But in recent years the shutdown scenario has become so routine that it raises the question: Have shutdowns as a negotiating tool lost their punch?\n\nMonday brought few signs of progress. A partial shutdown that could occur at midnight Friday risks disrupting government operations and leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay over the holiday season. Costs would be likely in the billions of dollars.\n\nTrump was meeting with his team and getting regular updates, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump was also tweeting Monday to keep up the pressure.\n\nExiting a Senate Republican leadership meeting late Monday, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said, \"It looks like it probably is going to have to build for a few days here before there's a solution.''\n\nThe president is insisting on $5 billion for the wall along the southern border with Mexico, but he does not have the votes from the Republican-led Congress to support it. Democrats are offering to continue funding at current levels, $1.3 billion, not for the wall but for fencing and other border security.\n\nIt's unclear how many House Republicans, with just a few weeks left in the majority before relinquishing power to House Democrats, will even show up mid-week for possible votes. Speaker Paul Ryan's office had no update. Many Republicans say it's up to Trump and Democrats to cut a deal.\n\n\u200bSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump talk most days, but the senator's spokesman would not confirm if they spoke Monday about a plan. McConnell opened the chamber hoping for a \"bipartisan collaborative spirit'' that would enable Congress to finish its work.\n\n\"We need to make a substantial investment in the integrity of our border,'' McConnell said. \"And we need to close out the year's appropriation process.''\n\nMeanwhile more than 800,000 government workers are preparing for the uncertainty ahead.\n\nThe dispute could affect nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests.\n\nAbout half the workers would be forced to continue working without immediate pay. Others would be sent home. Congress often approves their pay retroactively, even if they were ordered to stay home.\n\n\"Our members are asking how they are supposed to pay for rent, food, and gas if they are required to work without a paycheck,'' said a statement from J. David Cox, Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the large federal worker union. \"The holiday season makes these inquiries especially heart-wrenching.''\n\nMany agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, are already funded for the year and will continue to operate as usual, regardless of whether Congress and the president reach agreement this week.\n\nCongress already approved funding this year for about 75 percent of the government's discretionary account for the budget year that began Oct. 1.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, wouldn't be affected by any government shutdown because it's an independent agency.\n\nTrump said last week he would be \"proud'' to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a border wall.\n\n\u200bDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico has refused.\n\nDemocratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, in a meeting last week at the White House, suggested keeping funding at its current level, $1.3 billion, for improved fencing. Trump had neither accepted nor rejected the Democrats' offer, telling them he would take a look.\n\nSchumer said Monday he had yet to hear from Trump. Speaking on the Senate floor, Schumer warned that \"going along with the Trump shutdown is a futile act'' because House Democrats would quickly approve government funding in January.\n\n\"President Trump still doesn't have a plan to keep the government open,'' Schumer said Monday. \"No treat or temper tantrum will get the president his wall.''\n\nOne option for lawmakers would be to provide stopgap funding for a few weeks, until the new Congress convenes Jan. 3, when Pelosi is poised to become House speaker.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who is in line to become the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, suggested a stopgap bill could be one way to resolve the issue or a longer-term bill that includes money for border security.\n\nGOP leaders, though, were frustrated as the clock ticked away. Leaving the weekly leadership meeting, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said any planning was a \"very closely held thing. That's why we should never let this happen. We should pass the bills the way we're supposed to pass them.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Senate Advances Criminal Justice Reform", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-advances-criminal-justice-reform/4705171.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. Senate advanced a bipartisan bill Monday that would decrease America's large prison population by lowering some mandatory federal sentences and giving prisoners added opportunities to earn reductions in jail time.\n\nWith the 82-12 procedural vote, the Senate formally took up the First Step Act, which is backed by President Donald Trump but has fewer than two weeks to reach his desk before the end of the current Congress.\n\n\"This landmark legislation restores fairness in sentencing by ensuring that penalties fit their crimes, gives low-level, non-violent offenders a better chance to turn over a new leaf upon release from prison, and ultimately reduces crime and makes our streets and neighborhoods safer,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement.\n\n\"These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars,\" Trump tweeted. \"It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.\"\n\nThe First Step Act would retroactively end the discrepancy in federal sentences for drug offenses involving crack and the powder form of cocaine, reducing jail time for thousands of prisoners already serving time for crack offenses.\n\nThe bill also would reduce some mandatory sentences, give federal judges more flexibility to make exceptions to mandatory prison terms, and allow prisoners to earn greater sentence reductions through good behavior and vocational training.\n\n\"The vast majority of prison inmates will one day be released back into our communities after serving their sentence,\" Grassley said. \"It is in everyone's best interest to equip inmates with the skills and training needed to be become productive citizens, rather than returning to a life of crime.\"\n\nProponents say the bill aims to correct a failed 1980s-era attempt to deter illegal drug use that established long mandatory prison sentences for drug convictions.\n\n\"Since 1980, the federal prison population has grown by over 700 percent,\" Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin said. \"Today, the United States of America holds more prisoners by far than any country in the world, more than Russia or China.\"\n\nDurbin added that existing law has unfairly targeted people of color, saying, \"The majority of illegal drug users and dealers in America are white.

Even if it becomes law, the First Step Act would have a modest impact on incarceration numbers, as the bill only applies to federal inmates, who account for less than 10 percent of the national total. Other initiatives seek to achieve similar results at the state level.\n\nSupport for bill\n\nA wide array of law enforcement organizations support the bill, as do both right-leaning and left-leaning advocacy groups.\n\nDurbin hailed \"the most extraordinary political coalition I've ever witnessed in the time I've been in Washington\" joining forces to back the legislation.\n\n\"Every once in a while, the stars line up, and the Democrats and the Republicans, and the conservatives and the progressives, and the president and the Congress agree on something,\" the Illinois Democrat said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "CBS Fires CEO Leslie Moonves and Denies $120M Severance", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/cbs-fires-ceo-leslie-moonves-and-denies-120m-severance/4705173.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "CBS said on Monday it has fired Leslie Moonves for cause and has denied a $120 million severance package as it girds for a likely legal battle with its former chief executive who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault that allegedly took place before and after he joined the company.\n\nThe decision to deprive Moonves of his severance follows a board of directors review of the findings of an investigation into Moonves' behavior and the CBS culture conducted by two law firms, Debevoise & Plimpton and Covington & Burling, hired by CBS.\n\n\"We have determined that there are grounds to terminate for cause, including his willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract, as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the company's investigation,\" CBS's board of directors said in a statement that did not disclose details of the investigation.\n\nA draft report of the investigation was leaked to the New York Times this month.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.\n\n\n\n\"It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge \u2014 and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,\" said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.\n\n\n\nUntil the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn \u2014 who pleaded guilty to lying about conversations during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador \u2014 was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.\n\nProsecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate. Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him. And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.\n\n\n\nFlynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.\n\n\n\nThen came his sentencing memo.\n\n\n\nAlthough Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI. They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents \u2014 rather than involve lawyers.\n\n\n\nThey also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves. Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak. Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.\n\n\n\nMueller's team has rejected any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in a sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.\n\n\n\n\"A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, \"They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.\"\n\nTrump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them. He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a \"great person\" and asserting erroneously last week that the FBI said he didn't lie.\n\n\n\nFlynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.\n\n\n\nArun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's \"inconsistent\" with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.\n\n\n\n\"You also wonder in this very unusual situation,\" he said, \"whether it is a play for a pardon.\"\n\n\n\nIt's possible at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview. That included portions of the notes from Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 interview with FBI agents.\n\n\n\nResponding to Sullivan's order, prosecutors filed a redacted copy of the FBI interview notes Monday evening. The notes show FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his Russian contacts, including past trips to the country and his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the U.S.\n\n\n\nLast year, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about the contents of his conversations with Kislyak during the presidential transition.\n\n\n\nThe notes show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak not to escalate Russia's response to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over election interference. But Flynn admitted as part of his guilty plea that he did.\n\nThe notes also show Flynn told agents he didn't ask Kislyak to see if Russia would vote a certain way on a United Nations resolution involving Israeli settlements. But last year he admitted having asked Kislyak to see if Russia would vote against or delay the resolution. Court papers show Flynn made the request at the direction of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\n\n\nSullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, \"I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.\"\n\n\n\nIn an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the experience inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n\nBut while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.\n\n\n\n\"To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap \u2014 it's an absurd allegation,\" he said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "GOP Waits on Trump as Clock Ticks Toward Partial Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/gop-waits-on-trump-as-clock-ticks-toward-partial-shutdown/4705250.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The fight over President Donald Trump's $5 billion wall funds deepened Monday, threatening a partial government shutdown in a standoff that has become increasingly common in Washington.\n\nIt wasn't always like this, with Congress and the White House at a crisis over government funding. The House and Senate used to pass annual appropriation bills, and the president signed them into law. But in recent years the shutdown scenario has become so routine that it raises the question: Have shutdowns as a negotiating tool lost their punch?\n\nMonday brought few signs of progress. A partial shutdown that could occur at midnight Friday risks disrupting government operations and leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay over the holiday season. Costs would be likely in the billions of dollars.\n\nTrump was meeting with his team and getting regular updates, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump was also tweeting Monday to keep up the pressure.\n\nExiting a Senate Republican leadership meeting late Monday, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said, \"It looks like it probably is going to have to build for a few days here before there's a solution.''\n\nThe president is insisting on $5 billion for the wall along the southern border with Mexico, but he does not have the votes from the Republican-led Congress to support it. Democrats are offering to continue funding at current levels, $1.3 billion, not for the wall but for fencing and other border security.\n\nIt's unclear how many House Republicans, with just a few weeks left in the majority before relinquishing power to House Democrats, will even show up mid-week for possible votes. Speaker Paul Ryan's office had no update. Many Republicans say it's up to Trump and Democrats to cut a deal.\n\n\u200bSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump talk most days, but the senator's spokesman would not confirm if they spoke Monday about a plan. McConnell opened the chamber hoping for a \"bipartisan collaborative spirit'' that would enable Congress to finish its work.\n\n\"We need to make a substantial investment in the integrity of our border,'' McConnell said. \"And we need to close out the year's appropriation process.''\n\nMeanwhile more than 800,000 government workers are preparing for the uncertainty ahead.\n\nThe dispute could affect nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests.\n\nAbout half the workers would be forced to continue working without immediate pay. Others would be sent home. Congress often approves their pay retroactively, even if they were ordered to stay home.\n\n\"Our members are asking how they are supposed to pay for rent, food, and gas if they are required to work without a paycheck,'' said a statement from J. David Cox, Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the large federal worker union. \"The holiday season makes these inquiries especially heart-wrenching.''\n\nMany agencies, including the Pentagon and the departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, are already funded for the year and will continue to operate as usual, regardless of whether Congress and the president reach agreement this week.\n\nCongress already approved funding this year for about 75 percent of the government's discretionary account for the budget year that began Oct. 1.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, wouldn't be affected by any government shutdown because it's an independent agency.\n\nTrump said last week he would be \"proud'' to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a border wall.\n\n\u200bDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico has refused.\n\nDemocratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, in a meeting last week at the White House, suggested keeping funding at its current level, $1.3 billion, for improved fencing. Trump had neither accepted nor rejected the Democrats' offer, telling them he would take a look.\n\nSchumer said Monday he had yet to hear from Trump. Speaking on the Senate floor, Schumer warned that \"going along with the Trump shutdown is a futile act'' because House Democrats would quickly approve government funding in January.\n\n\"President Trump still doesn't have a plan to keep the government open,'' Schumer said Monday. \"No treat or temper tantrum will get the president his wall.''\n\nOne option for lawmakers would be to provide stopgap funding for a few weeks, until the new Congress convenes Jan. 3, when Pelosi is poised to become House speaker.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who is in line to become the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, suggested a stopgap bill could be one way to resolve the issue or a longer-term bill that includes money for border security.\n\nGOP leaders, though, were frustrated as the clock ticked away. Leaving the weekly leadership meeting, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said any planning was a \"very closely held thing. That's why we should never let this happen. We should pass the bills the way we're supposed to pass them.''"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Senate Advances Criminal Justice Reform", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-advances-criminal-justice-reform/4705171.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "The U.S. Senate advanced a bipartisan bill Monday that would decrease America's large prison population by lowering some mandatory federal sentences and giving prisoners added opportunities to earn reductions in jail time.\n\nWith the 82-12 procedural vote, the Senate formally took up the First Step Act, which is backed by President Donald Trump but has fewer than two weeks to reach his desk before the end of the current Congress.\n\n\"This landmark legislation restores fairness in sentencing by ensuring that penalties fit their crimes, gives low-level, non-violent offenders a better chance to turn over a new leaf upon release from prison, and ultimately reduces crime and makes our streets and neighborhoods safer,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement.\n\n\"These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars,\" Trump tweeted. \"It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.\"\n\nThe First Step Act would retroactively end the discrepancy in federal sentences for drug offenses involving crack and the powder form of cocaine, reducing jail time for thousands of prisoners already serving time for crack offenses.\n\nThe bill also would reduce some mandatory sentences, give federal judges more flexibility to make exceptions to mandatory prison terms, and allow prisoners to earn greater sentence reductions through good behavior and vocational training.\n\n\"The vast majority of prison inmates will one day be released back into our communities after serving their sentence,\" Grassley said. \"It is in everyone's best interest to equip inmates with the skills and training needed to be become productive citizens, rather than returning to a life of crime.\"\n\nProponents say the bill aims to correct a failed 1980s-era attempt to deter illegal drug use that established long mandatory prison sentences for drug convictions.\n\n\"Since 1980, the federal prison population has grown by over 700 percent,\" Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin said. \"Today, the United States of America holds more prisoners by far than any country in the world, more than Russia or China.\"\n\nDurbin added that existing law has unfairly targeted people of color, saying, \"The majority of illegal drug users and dealers in America are white. But three-quarters of the people serving time in prison for drug offenses are African-American or Latino.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a similar version of the bill earlier this year. Now, the Senate is racing to complete work on the legislation before the chamber adjourns for the Christmas holiday.\n\nCriticism of bill\n\nThe First Step Act has robust but not universal Senate support in its current form. Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton is demanding the bill stipulate that some prisoners will be barred from early release.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the bill still has major problems & allows early release for many categories of serious, violent criminals,\" Cotton tweeted. \"This includes felons who commit violent bank robberies with dangerous weapons, who assault children, & who commit carjacking with the intent to cause death.\"\n\nCotton and several other Republicans are pressing an amendment that would specify which offenders are ineligible for sentence reductions, something that proponents of the First Step Act say the bill already sets forth.\n\n\"This bill will not allow dangerous, violent criminals to be released early \u2014 that [assertion] is pure fiction,\" said the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas. \"It's important that we look at people who are low risk of recidivism [committing more crimes] and low risk to public safety, because what we can do is use the resources \u2014 not to keep people like that behind bars unnecessarily \u2014 but to focus on the truly violent criminals.\"\n\nAmerica's prison population exceeds 2 million people, and incarceration consumes vast resources within the nation's justice system. Even if it becomes law, the First Step Act would have a modest impact on incarceration numbers, as the bill only applies to federal inmates, who account for less than 10 percent of the national total. Other initiatives seek to achieve similar results at the state level.\n\nSupport for bill\n\nA wide array of law enforcement organizations support the bill, as do both right-leaning and left-leaning advocacy groups.\n\nDurbin hailed \"the most extraordinary political coalition I've ever witnessed in the time I've been in Washington\" joining forces to back the legislation.\n\n\"Every once in a while, the stars line up, and the Democrats and the Republicans, and the conservatives and the progressives, and the president and the Congress agree on something,\" the Illinois Democrat said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Ex-FBI Chief Comey: Trump Undermines Rule of Law with 'Lies'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-fbi-chief-comey-says-trump-undermines-rule-of-law-with-lies-/4705172.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "Former FBI Director James Comey on Monday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of undermining the rule of law in the United States by lying about the FBI, and he urged Republican lawmakers to \"stand up and speak the truth\" about Trump's behavior.\n\nComey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017 while he was leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible Trump campaign collusion, made his remarks after his second appearance this month before two House of Representatives committees.\n\nComey said lawmakers had again asked about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails and a dossier that Republicans claim was used to justify a warrant to conduct secret surveillance of a Trump presidential campaign aide.\n\n\"This while the president of the United States is lying about the FBI, attacking the FBI and attacking the rule of law in this country.

Pterosaurs were only distantly related to dinosaurs and birds.\n\nBirds need feathers to fly. That was not the case with pterosaurs. Short, hair-like feathers covered their bodies and wings but lacked the strong central shaft of avian flight feathers, the researchers said. They may have provided insulation and other benefits, as hair does for mammals.\n\n\"They were not flight feathers,\" said paleontologist Baoyu Jiang of Nanjing University, who led the research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. \"They looked fuzzy, and they didn't have complicated feathers.\"\n\nThe researchers examined beautifully preserved Jurassic Period fossils roughly 160 to 165 million years old of two small pterosaurs called anurognathids from northeastern China.\n\nApparently forest dwellers and insect eaters, they possessed 18-inch (45 cm) wingspans, short tails and superficially frog-like faces.\n\nPterosaurs were the first vertebrates to master flight, followed much later by birds and bats.

The researchers said the appearance of feathers in both groups suggests feathers first evolved perhaps 250 million years ago in a common ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs.\n\nPterosaurs, the biggest of which had 35-foot (10.7-meter)wingspans, went extinct along with the dinosaurs after an asteroid impact 66 million years ago."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Scientists Spot Solar System's Farthest Known Object", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-spot-solar-system-s-farthest-known-object/4705203.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "Astronomers have spotted the farthest known object in our solar system \u2014 and they've nicknamed the pink cosmic body \"Farout.\"\n\n\n\nThe International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center announced the discovery Monday.\n\n\n\n\"Farout\" is about 120 astronomical units away \u2014 that's 120 times the distance between Earth and the sun, or 11 billion miles.

The new campus will be the main location for Google's advertising sales division, the Global Business Organization.\n\nGoogle hopes to start moving into two Hudson Street buildings by 2020, followed by a Washington Street in 2022 and will have the capacity to more than double its New York headcount, currently more than 7,000, in the next 10 years.\n\nThe company's plans to invest outside its home base mirror those of other U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc, which said last week it would spend $1 billion to build a new 133-acre campus in Austin, Texas.\n\nLast month, Amazon.com Inc said it would open offices in New York and the Washington, D.C. area, creating more than 25,000 jobs.\n\nMountain View, California-based Google's move to invest in prime real estate on the lower west side of Manhattan also underscores the growing importance of New York as a hub for innovation and an incubator for technology companies.\n\nWith a plethora of white-collar workers and good infrastructure, the city provides a better option to other places that would require more investment.\n\n\"We're growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it,\" said Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google.\n\nIt is a \"fairly sensible\" move for Google given the amount of available talent pool, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.\n\nIt also makes sense for Google as New York has been the center for their core advertising business, Cordwell added.\n\nU.S. corporations are also under pressure from the Trump administration to create more jobs domestically. Companies that have moved jobs overseas or closed factories have drawn sharp rebukes from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that Google was nearing a deal to buy or lease an office building in New York City that could add space for more than 12,000 new workers.\n\nGoogle's first New York office at 111 Eighth Avenue is one of the city's largest buildings that it bought in 2010 for $1.77 billion.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced a $2.4 billion purchase of the Manhattan Chelsea Market.

Kim Nace says they collect about 26,000 liters a year, thanks to a loyal group of dedicated donors.\n\n\u201cWe now have people who have some source-separating toilets in their homes.

We\u2019re trying to apply technologies to reduce odor, and we\u2019re trying to deal with trace contaminants like the pharmaceuticals,\u201d she said.\n\nDealing with pharmaceuticals is an important issue. Heat urine kills germs but has no effect on chemicals like drugs that pass through our bodies.\n\n\u201cWe know pharmaceuticals are a problem for aquatic organisms and water systems,\u201d Love said. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable about the impact on human health at very, very low levels. Independent of that, I think most people would prefer that they not be in their food.\u201d\n\n21st century infrastructure\n\nFor Love, this is all about redesigning our wastewater infrastructure for the 21st century. Too many nutrients in the water leads to poor water quality by causing hazardous algal blooms.\n\n\u201cOur water emissions are going into very sensitive water bodies that are vulnerable to these nutrient loads,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to change that dynamic.

The assassins have been linked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nU.S. Senators last Thursday passed the measure that blamed the prince for Khashoggi\u2019s killing and called on Riyadh to \u201censure appropriate accountability.\u201d Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nIn a lengthy statement early Monday, Saudi Arabia said the Senate\u2019s resolution \u201ccontained blatant interferences\u201d in the kingdom\u2019s internal affairs and undermines its regional and international role. The resolution was based on \u201cunsubstantiated claims and allegations,\u201d the statement also said.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,\u201d it said.\n\nSuch language is usually reserved for those who criticize the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, such as Sweden in 2015 after the public flogging of a blogger, and Canada this year over the arrests of women\u2019s rights activists.\n\nBut the statement was also tempered in saying the kingdom \u201creaffirms\u201d its commitment to relations with the United States and describing the Senate as \u201can esteemed legislative body of an allied and friendly government.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been reluctant to condemn the crown prince, despite U.S. intelligence officials concluding that Prince Mohammed must have at least had knowledge of the plot.

Other major agencies facing a shutdown include the departments of state, treasury and interior. Many of the affected employees would be deemed essential and be forced to work anyway. None would be paid during the shutdown and would have to get by on savings or short-term loans.\n\nRick Tyler, a former aide to the man who engineered the last extended government shutdown in 2013, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that Trump will cave in the days to come.\n\n\u201cThe only leverage in shutting down the government is who gets the blame for it.

And he\u2019s already taken the blame for it. Rick Tyler, former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)\n\nFor now, Trump and his key immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, have once again been talking up the possibility of a partial government shutdown to force Congress to appropriate billions of dollars to pay for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall, to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,\u201d Miller said Sunday to CBS News, adding that that would include, \u201cif it comes to it,\u201d a shutdown.\n\nTop White House communications adviser Mercedes Schlapp was somewhat less assertive while talking to reporters Monday but insisted that Congress had to come up with more than the $1.6 billion that Democrats have agreed to spend on border security enhancements \u2015 but not a \u201cwall\u201d \u2015 to resolve the problem.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to get to the point where we shut down the government,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to find increased spending for border security.\u201d\n\nBut House Republicans appear to lack the votes to pass a bill with the $5 billion in wall funding that Trump is demanding without Democratic help, while Senate Republicans need at least nine Democrats to pass a spending bill.\n\nHow Trump will react if Democrats do not give him what he wants is unclear.\n\nTrump enjoying his favorite pastime at his private club while those sworn to protect his life with their own deal with cash-flow problems in their households would be tough to defend, meaning that Trump likely would cancel or postpone his golf vacation until a new spending bill is approved. Conversely, though, his love of golfing probably makes a shutdown unlikely to begin with.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get mad and then sign it and claim the military is going to build the wall, which it won\u2019t,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd then everybody will forget about it.\u201d\n\nBuilding a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times from June 2015 to Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.\n\nBut the \u201cmaking Mexico pay\u201d part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexico\u2019s president at the time, Trump told Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.\n\nSince that January 2017 conversation, Trump has signed a half-dozen spending bills that cover DHS even though they included no money to build his wall. He appeared to come closest to vetoing one and forcing a shutdown last March, after he watched Fox News evening hosts criticize him for planning to approve a $1.3 trillion spending bill with zero dollars for his wall. He signed it anyway the following morning and said he did so because of all the money it contained for the military.\n\nHeading into the summer, Trump again started threatening to shut down the government at the end of the budget year in September if he didn\u2019t get his wall money, but then he started backing down as that deadline approached. He began arguing that he would have more leverage after the November midterm elections because of all the additional Republicans who would be elected.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it immediately after the election,\u201d he said in a Fox News interview conducted from one of his rallies on Sept. 7. \u201cWe do it right after the election where, hopefully, frankly, it will be easy because we\u2019ll have more Republicans, not less.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and Republicans got clobbered in the November midterms, picking up just two seats in the Senate despite having the most favorable map in decades while losing 40 seats in the House and control of that chamber.\n\nWhich means that instead of gaining leverage by waiting until after the election, Trump lost a good deal of it \u2015 an altered dynamic made clear during a meeting last week with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Both told him they were not interested in building the sort of wall he promised and urged Trump not to go forward with the shutdown."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Roger Stone Admits To Lying On Infowars, Must Publicly Apologize", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-infowars-lawsuit_us_5c1846b7e4b0432554c36af0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Roger Stone, former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump, settled a defamation suit on Monday, agreeing to publicly apologize for publishing false information on the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars.\n\nThe settlement, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks the culmination of a $100 million lawsuit filed against Stone by Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, a vocal critic of Beijing whom Stone, a contributor to Infowars, falsely claimed had been convicted of financial crimes by donating to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon.\n\nIn lieu of paying the damages, Stone must publish a retraction of the false statements on social media and run ads in the Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post apologizing for his claims about Guo, who applied for asylum in the U.S. last year after the Chinese government grew hostile toward him.\n\nStone, whose actions during the election are being eyed by special counsel Robert Mueller, said in a statement Monday that his false statements were based on information he received in 2017 from Sam Nunberg, another adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Republicans Are Having A 'No Exit' Moment On A Government Shutdown", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-government-shutdown_us_5c18150be4b0432554c335ce", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump says he\u2019s willing to shut down government if he doesn\u2019t get border wall money, Democrats are unwilling to give it to him and congressional Republicans are just looking for a way out.\n\nFour days until a partial government shutdown, no one on Capitol Hill seems to know what will happen by the end of this week.

But Trump has shown a total willingness to accept a shutdown this time around. He made no qualms last week about saying he\u2019d accept the blame during a meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and he sent one of his most hard-line advisers \u2015 Stephen Miller \u2015 on the Sunday news shows to further suggest that he would not be caving.\n\nBut the consensus on Capitol Hill is that this eventually ends with Republicans caving, one way or another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not winning this fight, and he\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d one senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Monday.\n\nAnother senior Republican aide said that, if Trump were smart, he\u2019d take a short-term CR and fight the Democrats in January. \u201cOtherwise, we shut it down over Christmas and Democrats are the heroes sending him clean CRs all of January and reminding everyone he shut the government down,\u201d the aide said.\n\nAnd if you were looking for a sense of how likely a shutdown is at this point, this aide added that he had not bought a plane ticket home for Christmas yet.\n\nCapitol Hill sources said the White House was divided internally over whether Republicans should just agree to a CR or whether they should shut down government over Democrats not giving Trump border wall funding.\n\nAgain, no one sees this ending with border wall money. Democrats have even backed off earlier offers to give Trump a sizable amount of funding in exchange for a renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program. But there\u2019s a real question whether Trump and other Republicans think they need a shutdown to show the GOP base that they\u2019re fighting for their campaign pledges and that Democrats are standing in the way.\n\nTrump has repeatedly signaled he would shut down the government over a lack of border wall funding, only to reluctantly sign a bill at the last minute when GOP leaders assure him this is the best deal he\u2019ll get.\n\nLast spring, Trump was ready to shut it down until aides told him he wouldn\u2019t be able to go to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida for the weekend because of bad optics. \u201cFuck that,\u201d Trump said, according to The Wall Street Journal, before calling a news conference to trash the bill that he had decided to sign.\n\nBut this time Trump seems like he\u2019ll be harder to convince.\n\nHouse Republican leaders had debated passing a funding bill \u2015 either for the Department of Homeland Security or for all the remaining agencies \u2015 that included $5 billion for the wall. But they decided it would likely be too tough of a haul with all the GOP members who have decided not to show up for the lame-duck session, and that the bill would just further bring them down a rabbit hole. (For a bill to reach the president\u2019s desk, it needs 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats in that chamber looked ready to block a bill if it got through the House, which was uncertain in the first place.)"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Trump Defender Alan Dershowitz Argues That Lying To The FBI Isn't A Crime", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-defender-alan-dershowitz-argues-that-lying-to-fbi-isnt-a-crime_us_5c17d292e4b0b1ea387f2bbc", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "On the eve of Michael Flynn\u2019s sentencing for lying to the FBI, retired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz joined the chorus of hyperventilating President Donald Trump supporters who claim that Flynn may have lied to the feds, but that doesn\u2019t mean he broke the law.\n\n\u201cFlynn did not commit a crime by lying,\u201d Dershowitz said during a Fox News interview Monday. \u201cThe lie has to be material to the investigation.

In a memo last week, Flynn\u2019s lawyers said he was not explicitly told there would be penalties for lying.

In reality, it noted, legal experts haven\u2019t found Flynn\u2019s treatment to have been unusual or unfair.)\n\nAmong those preaching the story are right-wingers like Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and Fox News\u2019 Judge Jeanine Pirro, who\u2019ve taken part in a sort of myth-making.

The state board announced Friday it was pushing back the date for a public evidentiary hearing in the probe as it continues to gather evidence and now plans to hold the hearing on Jan. 11, eight days after the new Congress is seated.\n\nThe resolution from the GOP executive committee in the 9th District came Monday after Harris, who leads McCready by 905 votes, suggested Republicans weren\u2019t supporting him the way Democrats were backing his opponent. The GOP-controlled legislature passed a law last week that would require a new primary if the state board orders a do-over, leading to speculation that Republicans were trying to distance themselves from Harris.\n\nMuch of the evidence that has emerged during the investigation so far suggests that McCrae Dowless, an operative working on Harris\u2019 behalf, improperly collected absentee ballots from voters in Bladen and Robeson counties in the district. In those two counties, there was an unusually high number of absentee ballots that went unreturned to state officials.\n\n\u201cAbsent clear and convincing evidence presented in public by the State Board of Elections that any alleged voting irregularities changed the outcome of the race or there is a substantial likelihood it could have been changed, the law requires Dr. Harris to be certified as the winner,\u201d the resolution says.\n\nThe state board does not have to show irregularities could have changed the outcome of an election to order a new one.

The parents said they don\u2019t plan to return to the parish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him do that to anybody else what he did to us,\u201d Jeff Hullibarger told WXYZ-TV.\n\nHistorically, Catholic doctrine taught that suicide was a mortal sin and that those who killed themselves could be exempt from eternal salvation.\n\nBut in 1992, a revision to the church\u2019s catechism, a list of core Catholic teachings, acknowledged that \u201cgrave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide\u201d and that God can offer those who die by suicide a chance to repent.\ufeff\n\nWXYZ-TV Detroit | Channel 7 / YouTube Maison Hullibarger's funeral took place at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in Temperance, Michigan, on Dec. 8.\n\nThe archdiocese said that LaCuesta was attempting to \u201coffer a message of confidence in salvation\u201d that aligned with the teachings of the Catholic Church. However, it acknowledged that the family was expecting a homily based on the teen\u2019s life, not one addressing how he had died.\n\n\u201cThe family was hurt further by [LaCuesta\u2019s] choice to share Church teaching on suicide, when the emphasis should have been placed more on God\u2019s closeness to those who mourn,\u201d the archdiocese said.\n\nLaCuesta himself apologized for the sermon in a statement published on the archdiocese\u2019s website, admitting that he had \u201cadded\u201d to the family\u2019s pain during a time when they needed comfort. He said he\u2019s hoping to stay at the parish and has pledged to work on being a better minister.\n\n\u201cThis work will involve some deep interior reflection \u2015 by myself and with the help of others \u2015 on how I could have missed the mark so completely in this case,\u201d the priest said.\n\nRev. James Martin, a Jesuit author and editor at large of the Catholic website America, wrote Monday on Twitter that this was \u201cindeed a pastoral disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe role of the priest here is to console the family, and offer hope, not scold the deceased,\u201d Martin wrote."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "J.K.

An estimated 740,000 children and adolescents in the U.S. may qualify for diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.\n\nOne hot summer day in July 2013, a teenage boy with delicate lips and pale blue eyes gathered up his pillows, comforter and sheets and dumped them in the hallway.\n\nLogan was angry and feeling unwanted, he later told doctors. He was also bored. He had lost his privileges for not doing his homework and was cooped up alone in his family\u2019s ranch-style house in Allen, Texas.\n\nHis mother, Amanda Brown, and stepfather, Delton Brown, both software systems engineers, were away at work. His younger brother, Elijah, was in day care.\n\nMaking his way to the kitchen, Logan found some matches on top of a cabinet and set the pile of bedding ablaze.\n\nWhen the fire marshals finally arrived, they found some smoldering linens and a 4-by-4-foot patch of damaged carpet exposing the concrete foundation. Logan was led away by police in handcuffs to a psychiatric facility, triggering a chain of events already familiar at the Brown household.\n\nHe was home about a week later.\n\nThe attending physician at Green Oaks Hospital in Dallas, Dr. Walter Elliston, recommended residential treatment, saying at the time of discharge that Logan had \u201climited insight into the dangerousness of his behavior.\u201d But the insurer for the health plan provided by Amanda Brown\u2019s employer declined to cover full-time care under her policy.\n\nInstead, a doctor evaluating the case on behalf of United Behavioral Health said Logan\u2019s \u201cacute psychiatric symptoms\u201d were resolved and offered coverage for partial hospitalization of Logan \u2015 a recommendation that Elliston strongly supported. His mother worried this treatment would be insufficient for Logan\u2019s needs and would require her to shield Elijah, who had begun to develop a stress response to the environment at home. But she was unable to quickly arrange full-time residential treatment that she could afford.\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2013, Logan was discharged.\n\nCracks And Loopholes In The Path To Treatment\n\nAmerica is in the throes of an epidemic of mass and interpersonal violence, often carried out by young men stewing in a mix of unaddressed mental health and behavioral problems. Sometimes the challenges these young men face are noticed too late.\n\nBut just as frequently, they are spotted early, but various factors \u2014 including inadequate coverage of mental illnesses by insurance companies \u2014 mean that children don\u2019t get the help they need soon enough to make a difference.\n\n\u201cEvery young person I see in prison, particularly those who are there for violent crimes, if we paid attention to the red flags and intervened earlier, [wouldn\u2019t be there],\u201d said Adam Foss, who served as assistant district attorney in the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office in Boston from 2008 to 2016.\n\nMost kids with mental health or behavioral conditions never commit violence. But the health care system was not designed to help those who do pose a danger to themselves or their families, and it often neglects them.\n\nBrandon Thibodeaux Logan at his mother's home in Allen, Texas, where in 2013 he set fire to a pile of linens. He was sent to a psychiatric facility, where a doctor recommended residential treatment, but insurance wouldn't cover it.\n\nData gathered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and a study by Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions suggest that 1 percent of the nation\u2019s population under age 18, or roughly 740,000 children and adolescents, may qualify as having a psychotic disorder.\n\n\u201cI can tell you horror story after horror story of kids who have been denied additional hospitalization, who have been denied residential [placement], and the kid is running around the kitchen wielding knives,\u201d said Gene Beresin, the executive director at the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \u201cSome families are absolutely terrorized.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, he said, is that \u201cthe treatment of children requires a village, and we don\u2019t have a village. We have silos, and not all these silos are covered by insurance.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Americans are facing a problem brought on by progress. A generation or two ago, children with behaviors that require specialized treatment or accommodation \u2015 ranging from psychopathy to depression to neurological diversity, like autism \u2015 were institutionalized in public and private facilities. Today a more enlightened system tries to keep the mentally ill and developmentally disabled with their families.\n\nBut for those who act out violently and threaten even loved ones, two questions endure: What is the best way to care for them? And who picks up the tab?\n\nWhen Congress passed the Mental Health Parity Act in 1996 \u2015 and then repeatedly extended and expanded it all the way through the Affordable Care Act of 2010 \u2015 it was supposed to level the playing field for mental health ailments. Federal law requires that insurers apply the same criteria in determining coverage for physical and mental illnesses. But the law is not strictly enforced, and insurers have taken advantage of that.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in their ability to circumscribe inpatient care for mental illnesses more narrowly than inpatient care for physical illnesses. Often, insurers will not cover long-term residential treatments for mental health patients, even when doctors think these are optimal and offer the best chance at improvement \u2015 and even when residential treatment is listed as one of the insurance plan\u2019s benefits. Ultimately, laying claim to residential treatment hinges on the interpretation of a few seemingly innocuous words \u2015 \u201cacute\u201d versus \u201ccustodial\u201d services, the latter being the industry\u2019s shorthand for nonskilled care. Amid the parsing of language, families like the Browns can be left in the lurch.\n\nMost kids with mental health or behavioral conditions never commit violence. But the health care system was not designed to help those who do pose a danger to themselves or their families, and it often neglects them.\n\nAmanda Brown is one of about 155 million Americans covered by an employer-sponsored health plan. In her case, the coverage comes through UnitedHealth Group, one of the country\u2019s largest health insurers.\n\nYet, as she discovered, even for people like her \u2015 and perhaps especially for people like her \u2015 it is mind-numbingly difficult to access coverage for the long-term treatment of behavioral disorders.\n\nWealthy families can afford to pay out of pocket for the services their children need. And the expansion of Medicaid in more than 30 states under the Affordable Care Act has meant that impoverished individuals have greater access to inpatient treatment and intensive community-based services than in the past.\n\nBut \u201cif you are middle class, it is damn near impossible to do anything for a mentally ill child,\u201d Brown said.\n\nFrom the time he was a toddler, Logan was a mystery to his mother. While academically on track, he acted out in surprisingly violent ways. At age 2, he was asked to leave his first day care facility for \u201cerratic behavior and uncontrolled defiance,\u201d she said.\n\nAt age 5, Logan went up behind her, Brown remembered, and struck her with a rubber snake in anger over her request that he put away his toys.\n\nAt first, she thought, \u201cI can fix this,\u201d she said.\n\nSeparated from his father when Logan was born, Brown remarried in 2005, and her son\u2019s rages eased for a time. He bonded with her new husband, whom Logan called \u201cDad.\u201d The two shot hoops, played video games and tossed footballs. When she got divorced a few years later, the boy took the split badly.\n\nBrandon Thibodeaux Logan's mother, Amanda Brown, has fought with her insurance company to secure full-time care for him and has feared for the safety of her younger son, Elijah.\n\nOver the years, Logan alternated between savagery and sweetness. His family \u2015 which eventually included a new father figure, Delton Brown, and a baby brother, Elijah \u2015 lived in a constant state of surveillance. Silverware and sharp knives were locked in the laundry room. External doorknobs were installed on the doors to the parents\u2019 and Elijah\u2019s bedrooms so Logan couldn\u2019t enter without a key.\n\n\u201cI was taken aback the first time I saw him go into a rage. There was this blank stare,\u201d remembered Delton Brown, whom Amanda Brown married in 2011. \u201cI had never been in an environment where I had to lock myself away from a kid,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, his mother said that she and Logan fought over unfinished homework as she cooked dinner. An agitated Logan paced, yelled and threw things at her and Elijah, then 21 months old.\n\nLogan tried to pour lighter fluid over the toddler\u2019s head. Brown snatched the container away, but then Logan balanced a 10-pound bowling ball over Elijah. She put one hand under the bowling ball and with the other pushed Logan away.\n\nEventually she phoned the police, who took Logan to a juvenile facility for the night. He received six months\u2019 probation.\n\nBrown lived in a perpetual state of paranoia over what her older son might do next. After finding a dead rabbit in the yard, she called the police, worried that Logan might have dismembered it. The officer who responded said it was partly eaten by a hawk.\n\nThe disharmony at home weighed on Elijah too. When he was 11 months old, he started pulling out his hair and eating it \u2015 a stress response, his pediatrician told her. She shaved his head after the pediatrician warned that the clumps of hair could calcify in his stomach and need to be surgically removed.\n\nThe Semantics Of Care\n\nIn 2011, the year Logan turned 12, Brown began to look closely into the benefits offered by United Behavioral Health, the subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that administers and rules on mental health claims under her self-funded health plan. She was relieved to read that her policy covered inpatient mental health care and services at residential treatment facilities.\n\nShe didn\u2019t pay much attention to it at first, but her policy also noted that the insurer \u201cdetermines coverage for all levels of care.\u201d\n\nPolice officers arrived shortly after a neighbor called 911 about the fire. They knew the Brown house well. Ten months before he set the blaze, Logan held a butcher knife to his own stomach. The police took him to a psychiatric hospital in handcuffs. He was given inpatient care for five weeks.\n\nAt that point, United Behavioral Health determined that he was not eligible for coverage of additional inpatient care under Brown\u2019s health plan.\n\n\u201cAlthough he continues to have challenges at times using more appropriate coping strategies when he is frustrated, he does not appear to require the kind of services of an acute residential rehabilitation care setting at this point,\u201d a doctor evaluating the case for United Behavioral Health wrote in a letter to Brown dated Oct. 19, 2012.\n\nThe doctor said the care Logan was receiving was considered \u201ccustodial,\u201d which was defined in the letter as the delivery of clinical or nonclinical services that do not seek to cure and that are provided during times when a patient\u2019s behavioral health condition is not changing. Such services don\u2019t need to be implemented by trained clinical personnel, wrote the doctor, who offered the Browns treatment for Logan with outpatient providers.\n\nArriving at the scene of the fire in July 2013, the police officers phoned Brown at work and asked her to return home. \u201cShe refused to come,\u201d said Allen Police Department Sgt. John Felty. \u201cShe said, \u2018Take him to the hospital.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had previously had such a horrible time trying to get the child care, I wanted him to be transported to the hospital via police, not by me,\u201d Brown explained. \u201cI had hoped that the insurance and the hospital would take things more seriously that way.\u201d\n\nFelty said that under Texas law, the police didn\u2019t have cause to take Logan to the hospital. He would have to be imminently suicidal or homicidal, the officer said.\n\nAccording to Felty, Logan suddenly declared, \u201cI have changed my mind. I want to hurt myself. Take me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nBut again, it would not be for long.\n\nBrandon Thibodeaux Logan began acting out as early as age 2. At various times, he has been diagnosed with mood disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.\n\nDoctors at Green Oaks Hospital diagnosed Logan with mood disorder (not otherwise specified) \u2014 a malady he was first labeled with at age 10 \u2015 as well as oppositional defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to the hospital\u2019s discharge summary. Diagnoses like these are common among boys who in previous generations would have been called troubled or delinquent. They can also be stand-ins for diagnoses such as bipolar disorder (with which Logan was eventually diagnosed) that the psychological establishment typically hesitates to apply to children.\n\nIn Logan\u2019s case, his mother\u2019s health insurance included a generous menu of mental health benefits. But accessing these benefits hinged on criteria that Brown said were never made explicit in her benefits book.\n\nCoverage of inpatient and residential care appeared to be predicated on the presence of acute symptoms of mental illness. In denying coverage for residential treatment after the fire-setting episode, a United Behavioral doctor said in a letter to the family that Logan had been \u201cmedically cleared for acute medical issues and does not require the 24-hour monitoring provided at the residential rehabilitation level of care.\u201d\n\nThe doctor acknowledged that Logan still needed \u201can environment that provides safety and daily care needs.\u201d Again, however, such nonacute care fell under the catch-all term of custodial or nonskilled services. Custodial services were not covered by Brown\u2019s plan, United Behavioral Health said.\n\nThat is simply not a defensible line to draw, according to Dr. Henry Harbin, a former CEO of behavioral health care companies Magellan Health Services and Greenspring Health Services who reviewed United Behavioral Health\u2019s letters to Brown. \u201cMost mental health and medical diseases are not acute. They require long-term, episodic treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe advises the Parity Implementation Coalition, which seeks to ensure that mental and physical health benefits are comparable from a quantitative standpoint, such as number of doctor visits, and a nonquantitative standpoint, such as the setting of medical necessity criteria that can restrict the duration of inpatient care.\n\nIf you are middle class, it is damn near impossible to do anything for a mentally ill child. Amanda Brown, whose son has been in and out of psychiatric care\n\nUnder the parity law, Harbin said, if the insurer doesn\u2019t limit inpatient care coverage for those with physical illnesses to acute situations, then it can\u2019t so limit coverage for mental health patients. It is possible that UnitedHealth pays only for acute care for physical illnesses, he said, but \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it in my career. What employer would buy a policy that says, \u2018Sorry, this is only for acute care. If you have cancer, you are not covered\u2019?\u201d\n\nDr. Martin Rosenzweig, the chief medical officer at Optum Behavioral, a UnitedHealth brand, defended the company\u2019s decisions to limit coverage in Logan\u2019s case in an April 2017 interview. \u201cHonestly, there are no parity issues present in this case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe challenge with behavioral health, he said, is it lacks the clear guidelines or treatment paths that exist on the physical side.\n\nFor all kinds of disorders, both mental and physical ailments, the insurer looks at \u201cmedical necessity\u201d in assessing coverage, Rosenzweig said. The focus on acuity of symptoms, he added, is meant to \u201cmatch the intensity of symptoms with the intensity of service.\u201d\n\nIn other words, not every symptom requires inpatient care. What the insurer\u2019s doctors are doing is weighing the risks that a patient\u2019s symptoms will worsen.\n\n\u201cYou will hear the symptom someone is suicidal, but there is a continuum there. How imminent is that? What is the [patient\u2019s] intent?\u201d said Rosenzweig. \u201cSome people may have vague thoughts that they would be better off dead or they feel hopeless or they are a burden, all the way to someone who is actively planning [to kill him- or herself].\u201d\n\nFor some people, chronic self-destructive thoughts are part of their illness, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep them in hospital until it completely goes, because it is not necessarily helpful,\u201d he added.\n\nBesides, he said, the decisions to discharge Logan after various episodes were made by the clinicians, not the insurer. \u201cWe don\u2019t make discharge decisions.\u201d\n\nRosenzweig disagreed with the suggestion that United Behavioral Health effectively made that decision when it stopped paying. \u201cIt is about what is covered under a plan and how we determine that versus the decision of whether you stay in the hospital or not.\u201d\n\nFighting For Coverage\n\nRefusing to cover mental health care on medical necessity grounds is not unique to United Behavioral Health. Nearly one-third of respondents to a survey conducted in 2014 by the advocacy group National Alliance on Mental Illness said that they or a family member had been denied mental health coverage because of such criteria. That was more than twice the percentage who said they had been denied medical care coverage.\n\nIn some states, frustrated families have set up support networks to advocate for change. A few years ago, New Jersey parents formed Denied Treatment, a group pushing the state to investigate claims that the federal parity law is not being followed.\n\nSometimes patients and their families go to court \u2015 and sometimes this helps. State regulators and aggressive state attorneys generals such as New York\u2019s have also brought cases that attempt to fill the void left by lack of federal enforcement of the parity law. This year, California\u2019s Blue Shield and Magellan Health Services, which handles the insurer\u2019s mental health claims, agreed to pay a $7 million settlement in a class action lawsuit accusing them of improperly using medical necessity standards to restrict coverage for residential and intensive outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n\nAn ongoing class action against United Behavioral Health in a California court alleges that the insurer has been changing its level-of-care guidelines \u201cto make them even more focused on the presence of acute symptoms (and therefore more restrictive).\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople rely in good faith on managed care companies to be honest with them,\u201d said attorney Meiram Bendat, whose Los Angeles\u2013based firm, Psych-Appeal, filed the suit. United Behavioral Health is \u201credefining the member\u2019s benefits, saying they are limited to acute residential care when they are not.\u201d\n\nThe Browns have received a notice saying they may be part of the class covered by the lawsuit filed by Psych-Appeal. A spokeswoman for the insurer said it believes the suit is without merit.\n\nBrandon Thibodeaux Logan puts his hand on his head in frustration as he and his mother tackle his schoolwork. He spent nearly two years at a therapeutic boarding school but left because of \"lack of progress\" and safety concerns about his aggressive behavior, according to his exit report.\n\nDuring the first weeks of August 2013, after he returned home from Green Oaks Hospital, Logan trashed the house \u2015 overturning a recliner, kicking barstools and ripping up carpet that had been patched up after the fire, Brown said. Fearful for Elijah, she moved her younger son into her bedroom.\n\nAnd she searched for the long-term residential care that the doctors had recommended for Logan. Some facilities refused to take him because of his aggression, while others were too pricey. Desperate, she approached Texas Child Protective Services.\n\nBut CPS focuses on abused and neglected children. At that time, the only way the agency would take Logan into state care, Brown learned, was if she refused to pick him up from a hospital or otherwise abandoned him.\n\n\u201cCPS would take him into custody, and the state would sue us \u2026 but he\u2019d have the care he needed,\u201d Brown recalled. \u201cIt was a terrifying choice. I obviously never even want to seem as if I am abandoning a child. The thought makes me want to cry. But at the same time, Logan needed care that we were not able to get through our insurance.\u201d\n\nEventually, she secured a spot for him at Resolution Ranch Academy, a therapeutic boarding school for troubled teenage boys, a four-hour drive away in Cameron, Texas. To cover the family\u2019s mounting expenses, she drained his 529 college savings plan and took out a $60,000 loan. After long days at her primary job, she began moonlighting as a copy editor to try to make a dent in the debt.\n\nA spokeswoman for United Behavioral Health said that it empathizes with the Browns and believes Logan has received \u201call medically necessary care.\u201d Over the years, the insurer has approved claims totaling more than $71,000 for him.\n\nBrown has documented more than $135,000 that she has spent out of pocket on her son\u2019s care. She suspects that sum significantly understates the total expense because at some point she stopped counting.\n\nWhen he arrived at Resolution Ranch, Logan was expected to stay six to eight months. He remained there for 22 months, costing the Browns $68,306.\n\nIn June 2015, he left the facility because of \u201clack of progress, safety concerns due to continued aggression, and medical concerns due to recent seizures requiring two hospitalizations,\u201d according to his exit report. \u201cLogan is in need of a higher level of medical and psychological care.\u201d\n\nUnited Behavioral Health approved a request that Logan next be admitted to the Meridell Achievement Center, a residential treatment facility northwest of Austin.\n\nFor a time, Brown felt optimistic. Her son had been on a cocktail of drugs since he was 10. At Meridell the doctors tapered off his dosages of mood stabilizers like Depakote, the antipsychotic Risperdal and the antidepressant Zoloft and put him on a couple of new medications \u2015 Trileptal, an antiepileptic, and amantadine, which is typically used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease but is also given to children with disruptive mood disorders.\n\nThe new medicines seemed to work better, she said.\n\nBut after a little less than a month, United Behavioral said it would stop approving coverage for inpatient care at Meridell. At that point, it had approved more than $15,000 in claims from the facility.\n\nBrandon Thibodeaux Logan spent over a month in jail after posting a menacing comment and photo on social media. \"I said something I shouldn\u2019t have,\" he admitted.\n\nIn one physician-to-physician review conducted with Gary Rosenberg of United Behavioral Health, Meridell psychiatrist James Hageman noted that \u201cwe discussed continuing reports of suicidal ideation with a plan to \u2018get a gun and shoot myself\u2019 upon leaving treatment.\u201d\n\nHageman alleges in his discharge notes that Rosenberg said, \u201cI hear what you say but this is a patient who has been inpatient or in residential treatment for the last three years. He will need to be in treatment for many years. I do not think suicidal ideation is enough to warrant residential treatment.\u201d\n\nRosenberg said that while he didn\u2019t remember details of the case, the discharge notes are \u201ca blatant misquoting of what I was intending to say. I am certainly not in favor of people leaving treatment at whatever level of care until they have accomplished what they need to accomplish at that level of care and there is a structured treatment plan in place for the next level of care.\u201d He said if he had recommended that the patient leave residential treatment, then it was because the clinical evidence supported that the individual had \u201cbenefited from that level of care.\u201d\n\nIn a letter dated July 1, 2015, doctors for United Behavioral Health told the Browns that the insurance company would no longer authorize coverage for Logan\u2019s treatment. They said he had received \u201cextensive\u201d inpatient and residential treatment since 2011 and yet he \u201ccontinues to make threats to harm himself at home and shows no motivation to be safe in the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no expectation that continuing acute mental health residential care is going to make your child be able to be safe in the community within a reasonable time period,\u201d they concluded.\n\nLogan appeared to \u201crequire long-term residential care,\u201d the doctors said, and that was not covered under Brown\u2019s health plan. The doctors suggested continued treatment with outpatient providers consulting with a long-term state facility.\n\nA subsequent letter noted that Brown could seek an independent external appeal, but she did not. She said she figured that if Logan\u2019s doctors couldn\u2019t persuade the insurance company to cover more days at the facility, then she certainly couldn\u2019t.\n\nI can tell you horror story after horror story of kids who have been denied hospitalization and are running around the kitchen wielding knives. Gene Beresin, executive director at the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital\n\n\u201cI know in my situation I should have been sent away,\u201d Logan told a reporter in the fall of 2016, two months after returning from a therapeutic boarding school in Utah. \u201cI needed to go.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d for a child to be sent away, he said. \u201cIt has to be at a point where you can\u2019t help him no more.\u201d\n\nWhen Logan returned home that fall, Brown initially noticed an improvement. He continued to lash out verbally, but he rarely turned violent.\n\nThe teenager even handled a major disappointment well. After a girl who had asked him to the homecoming dance canceled, he was invited to join a male friend who also lacked a date. At the last moment, the friend refused to enter the dance hall, which meant Logan couldn\u2019t attend either.\n\n\u201cI have to say, he handled it admirably,\u201d his mother said.\n\nLast year Logan turned 18 and moved away, living at first with his grandfather in Arkansas. This July he was arrested by local police and taken to Sebastian County Adult Detention Center in Fort Smith.\n\nCommunicating via Smartjailmail in August, he wrote that he doesn\u2019t believe he has bipolar disorder or any other mental illness diagnoses that doctors have given him. He thinks that his real ills start and stop with a withholding family that doesn\u2019t try to understand him. \u201cI just have been done wrong too many times by the ones I thought I could rely on, including my own family,\u201d he said.\n\nHis crime was posting a photo of himself on Instagram holding a knife with a caption that read, \u201cTime to shoot up a school.\u201d\n\nHe recognized that it was a mistake \u2015 \u201cI said something I shouldn\u2019t have\u201d \u2015 but insisted it was just words \u2015 \u201cI have too big of a heart to do anything like that.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 09:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said.

The social media apparatus that Russia exploited in 2016 \u2014 feeds engineered to show users emotionally engaging content, paired with viral sharing mechanisms and self-service advertising platforms \u2014 has been enormously profitable for these companies, and remains largely intact.\n\nTo the extent that social media giants\u2019 incentives align with America\u2019s national security interests, it is because they fear the wrath of lawmakers and regulators, and because the reputational damage associated with Russia\u2019s 2016 exploitation has dragged down their stock prices and made it harder to recruit.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t hold our breath for these companies to voluntarily self-regulate. Instead, to contain this amorphous threat, we\u2019ll almost certainly have to look elsewhere for help.\n\nFirst, while pressuring social media companies to take information warfare seriously, the public and the media will need to take steps to make ourselves less vulnerable to influence campaigns, by increasing our fluency with disinformation and media manipulation tactics. As long as tools for targeted digital mass persuasion exist, Russian-style influence operations will be with us. And any new social network competing with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter will need to consider, from Day 1, how propaganda can be kept at bay. It is no longer enough to build a platform, attract millions or billions of users, and then deal with the consequences.\n\nSecond, Congress will need to act. Since the 2016 election, we have learned about Russia\u2019s disinformation campaigns in incredible detail, but lawmakers have done virtually nothing to prevent future influence operations.

And although relationships between Silicon Valley tech companies and American intelligence agencies have reportedly improved, there is still more work to be done.\n\nIf anything has changed since 2016, it\u2019s that social media is no longer seen as just a useful tool for influencing elections. It\u2019s the terrain on which our entire political culture rests, whose peaks and valleys shape our everyday discourse, and whose possibilities for exploitation are nearly endless.

On Saturday aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become the next speaker of the House, said she would move quickly to notify the Trump administration that House Democrats intended to step in to defend the law in the case.\n\nAs the legal showdown plays out, efforts to protect the A.C.A. are also underway in the courts. Earlier this year the state attorney general of Maryland sued the Trump administration for attempting to gut the act. The case is pending.\n\nNicholas Bagley, a health law expert at the University of Michigan, suggested that Judge O\u2019Connor may not yet be done with the case. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr. Bagley noted that the judge had not yet addressed a handful of central issues in the suit, nor had he issued a final ruling indicating whether the act should fall immediately. Judge O\u2019Connor could indeed hold onto the case before an appellate court takes it up.\n\nBut if he lets the case move forward, a likely timeline, according to many legal experts, is that the case will be taken up by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans this spring. If the Fifth Circuit upholds Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court is likely to agree to hear the case in its term that starts in October 2019, with a decision in 2020. If the Fifth Circuit overturns the judge\u2019s ruling and upholds the law, there is a good chance the Supreme Court would decline to even take the case, legal scholars said."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: The World Needs a Urine Test for TB.

It\u2019s inexpensive and has been recommended by the World Health Organization since 2015. But it is hardly used in the countries that most need it.\n\n\u201cThere is a $3.50 rapid test that works on urine, for crying out loud, and the fact that it\u2019s not being utilized is just ridiculous,\u201d said Sharonann Lynch, a policy adviser at the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPart of the problem, Ms. Lynch says, is that the W.H.O.\u2019s recommendation for the test is too limited.

We would assume that they do so from a strong base of evidence.\n\nBut with respect to heart failure, there is a shockingly small amount of evidence.\n\nHeart failure occurs when the heart can\u2019t pump enough blood to the rest of the body. About 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from it. Chronic high blood pressure can force the heart to work too hard over time, weakening it and leading to heart failure. Treatment usually involves trying to strengthen the contractions of the heart muscle with drugs, or reducing the volume of blood with other drugs (like diuretics) or by restricting salt intake.\n\nRecently, researchers searched for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of reduced sodium intake to treat heart failure. In all the literature, they found nine studies that involved 479 patients. One of them was published only in abstract form. None involved more than 100 patients. Over all, none were considered at low risk for bias.\n\nThere were no data that showed that salt restriction reduced mortality or cardiac disease; affected whether someone was admitted to the hospital; or influenced how long they had to stay if admitted. Of four outpatient studies, two showed no improvement in heart function, and two did."}]
