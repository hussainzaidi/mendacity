The President also pressed the commanding officer of a Coast Guard ship in Bahrain on trade before touting his trade policies and arguing that \"every nation in the world is taking advantage of us.\"\n\nUS Presidents have traditionally called troops stationed abroad during the holidays to boost morale and remind the country of their service, making Trump's rhetoric yet another striking break from the norms of presidential behavior. After the call wrapped, Trump entertained more than two dozen questions from reporters and once again discredited a CIA assessment about the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"This was, sadly, predictable and avoidable,\" said retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, a CNN military and diplomatic analyst. \"The President's conduct on that call, the manner in which he politicized it, demonstrated an utter and complete disregard for what military service means.\"\n\nTrump has not shied away from politicizing the military in the past, and on Thursday, he drew on US men and women in uniform to justify his controversial deployment of nearly 6,000 US troops to the southern border. Without evidence, he painted Air Force Gen. David Lyons as a proponent of his hardline immigration policies after Lyons said US troops are fighting in Afghanistan to prevent terrorists from reaching \"our shores again.\"\n\n\"Large numbers of people are forming at our border and I don't even have to ask you, I know what you want to do, you want to make sure that you know who we're letting in. And we're not letting in anybody essentially because we want to be very, very careful,\" Trump said, speaking to Lyons over the phone. \"You're right, you're doing it over there. We're doing it over here.\"\n\nThe topic brought Trump to another familiar airing of grievances, as he complained over the phone to the general that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has \"become a big thorn in our side.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace,\" Trump said. \"It's a disgrace.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: I'm thankful for the difference I made Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I'm thankful for the difference I made 00:34\n\nEarlier this week, a judge from the Northern District of California -- where cases get appealed to the 9th Circuit -- issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from barring migrants who cross into the US illegally from seeking asylum.\n\nAfter the call wrapped, Trump continued to focus on the 9th Circuit and his administration's efforts to prevent the group of migrants -- many of whom are seeking asylum -- from crossing into the US illegally.\n\nAs he continued to lambaste 9th Circuit rulings that have skewed against him, Trump called on Congress to \"get together and stop it.\" And he threatened to shut down the entire US-Mexico border over the approach of the few thousand migrants.\n\n\"If we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or our people are going to get hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,\" Trump warned. \"The whole border.\"\n\nTrump also once again undermined the CIA's assessment that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Khashoggi, insisting the agency did not conclude bin Salman was responsible.\n\n\"They have not concluded. Nobody's concluded. I don't know if anybody's going to be able to conclude that the crown prince did it,\" Trump said. \"They said he might have done it. That's a big difference.\"\n\nTrump continued to defend his decision not to blame the crown prince or issue more severe punishments on a series of false or unsubstantiated claims, suggesting diminished relations with Saudi Arabia would cause \"a global depression,\" result in the loss of \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\" and leave Israel defenseless.\n\nTrump also defended his daughter, Ivanka, after it emerged earlier this week that she had used a private email account to discuss or relay official White House business, a practice evocative of the one for which Trump harshly criticized Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.\n\nHe called her use of personal email -- which appears to have violated federal records laws -- \"very innocent\" and dismissed the comparison to Clinton, saying his daughter's private emails contained no classified information and were never deleted.\n\nAt one point, Trump was asked what he was most thankful for on this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"For having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country,\" Trump said. \"I've made a tremendous difference in the country.

The US Judiciary has strived to be above the political fray that has only been exacerbated by Trump.\n\nRoberts' response stems specifically from Trump's comments on Tuesday on District Court Judge Jon Tigar's Monday night decision to temporarily block an executive order that would have scaled back US asylum policy. Trump criticized the San Francisco-based Tigar, nominated in 2012, as an \"Obama judge.\" Of the regional US circuit court that would oversee any appeal of the case, Trump declared, \"an automatic loss\" for the administration and \"the 9th Circuit is very unfair.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, made public because of a query from The Associated Press, Roberts said, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Roberts had been asked to comment, but it was the first time he decided to go public. A 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, Roberts did not explain his timing.\n\nBut it may arise from the combination of Trump's specific insult -- portraying Tigar in a political realm based on the president who appointed him -- as well as the recent confirmation turmoil over new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nRoberts' public concern for the reputation of the federal judiciary comes as the Supreme Court is riven 5-4 along ideological and political lines. The recent retirement of swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy has deepened the split, and Roberts has already signaled an effort to try to lessen the divisions among the nine.\n\nThe chief justice spoke out broadly about judicial independence in October after the tumultuous Kavanaugh hearings. Addressing a University of Minnesota audience, Roberts referred to \"the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\" and then asserted the high court's independence from the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\"I will not criticize the political branches,\" he said. \"We do that often enough in our opinions. But what I would like to do, briefly, is emphasize how the judicial branch is -- how it must be -- very different.\"\n\nRoberts' statement on Wednesday was of a different magnitude, stronger and deliberately echoing back the President's own remark about an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThe chief justice has often expressed dismay when judges are referred to by political affiliation. He has also observed since 2010, with the retirement of liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, an appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, that it may be more difficult to convince the public of justices' impartiality from politics.\n\nSince Stevens was succeeded by Obama-appointee Elena Kagan, and continuing with Trump's choice of Kavanaugh, the court's five conservative justices were named by Republican presidents and the four liberals -- often relegated to the dissent -- were named by Democratic presidents.\n\nWith Kennedy's retirement, Roberts is now ideologically at the middle of the court, and he may be inclined to hedge his own conservative instincts to steady the bench and avoid more polarization.\n\nAs he considered whether to answer Trump's latest affront to the judiciary on Tuesday, Roberts no doubt weighed how much he might provoke Trump. Roberts plainly concluded it was time to defend judiciary's special role in America's democracy.\n\nThe 63-year-old chief was likely not surprised that within three hours, Trump fired back in two consecutive tweets: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is ... are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nRoberts offered no new retort. And given the chief justice's aversion to the appearance of politics, he is unlikely to offer any response any time soon."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Erin Burnett: Trump's remark sounds like a threat", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/78OHsge2U0U/justice-john-roberts-trump-judicial-criticism-ebof-sot-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Two captured adults died of illness while the four children were returned -- perhaps also infected with illnesses that the islanders' immune systems were unequipped to deal with.\n\nExcept for a brief, friendly interaction in the early 1990s, they have fiercely resisted contact with outsiders, even following disaster.\n\nIn 2004, following the Asian tsunami that devastated the Andaman chain, a member of the tribe was photographed on a beach on the island, firing arrows at a helicopter sent to check on their welfare.\n\nTwo years later, members of the tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters surrounding their home island, North Sentinel Island, after their boat drifted ashore, according to Survival International, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection of isolated tribal groups, which calls the tribe the \"world's most isolated.\"\n\n\"The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survive.

He returned with arrow injuries the same day, but set off once again to reach the island on November 17 and never returned. The fisherman later saw members of the tribe dragging his body around, authorities said.\n\nChau knew the island was a restricted area and his mission there was illegal, according to a friend, John Middleton Ramsey.\n\nChau had made a scouting trip to the remote island chain several years ago, and when he returned, Ramsey recalled Chau talked about his plans to go back to the island bearing gifts for the Sentinelese people.\n\nHe said he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life, eventually share the Gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, Ramsey recalled.\n\nAnthropological expeditions were made to tribal groups in the island chain in the 1980s and 1990s, and \"gift-dropping trips\" continued until the mid-90s, but now all contact has ceased.\n\nThe Indian government has adopted an \"'eyes-on and hands-off' policy to ensure that no poachers enter (North Sentinel Island),\" according to India's Ministry of Tribal Affairs.\n\n\"The Sentinelese have shown again and again that they want to be left alone, and their wishes should be respected,\" Survival International said.\n\nThe related Jarawa tribe, which stopped resisting contact with outsiders in 1998, offers a cautionary tale, the group reports.\n\n\"They are now plagued by intruders on their land stealing the animals they hunt, bringing in alcohol and sexually exploiting Jarawa women,\" according to a 2006 report\n\nDwindling numbers\n\nThe Andaman Island tribe is one of the last remaining isolated groups in the world.\n\nIn addition to the Sentinelese, Survival International says there are tribes living away from the influence of the outside world elsewhere in India, including the Tiger Reserve tribes in the Kaziranga National Park and the Dongria Kondh tribe in the Niyamgiri hill range in Odisha state.\n\nThere are thought to be around 100 uncontacted groups in the Amazon rainforest, according to the Brazilian government's Indian affairs department, FUNAI. Little is known about them, beyond their desire to remain isolated.\n\nIt is thought that they have chosen this way of life following the widespread enslavement of indigenous peoples by European settlers, from the conquering of the country in the 1500s for well over 200 years.\n\nTheir way of life remains under threat from loggers, mining concerns, ranchers, dams and road-building.\n\nElsewhere in South America, Survival International has documented isolated tribes in Paraguay, where their ancestral lands are experiencing \"the highest rate of deforestation in the world,\" a 2013 University of Maryland study claims.

The UAE and its bigger regional ally, Saudi Arabia, have led efforts to contain the spread of Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East. To the private irritation of the UAE, London does not classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, and its members are eligible for asylum in the UK if they can demonstrate evidence of persecution.\n\nThe UAE is part of the Saudi-led coalition that is fighting the Iran-backed Islamist rebels in Yemen.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) In October 1918, a swarm of smoldering fires flared and rode rising winds through 1,500 square miles outside Duluth, Minnesota. The flames incinerated cities, killed at least 450 people, and overtook evacuees as they fled in cars. It wasn't the last fire of a cycle that began in 1825 in Maine and migrated through the Lake States before moving on, but it was the last in which the fallen numbered in the hundreds.\n\nThen, over several decades, the scene calmed.\n\nThat former era of firestorms was sparked along the frontier. Settlers and logging companies felled the forests and left lands lathered in slash. They used fires widely to work the land into agriculture. They built houses and towns out of wood, and they lacked much incentive to prevent burning, or the capacity to fight the fires that blew up. Railroads cast sparks with abandon.\n\nYear after year, decade after decade, the sorrowful scenario repeated. But after the 1918 eruption, the rising tide ebbed.\n\nThis did not occur spontaneously. Cities gradually adopted fire and building codes and enforced them. They zoned in ways to halt fire spread and ensure egress. They installed a fire protection infrastructure.\n\nIndividual buildings and a town block burned here and there, but fires in cities no longer spread like fires in forests. The countryside also changed. Settlement ceased, and logging and its slash heaps were more or less domesticated. The wild and the settled were untangled into separate realms, routine burning on the landscape yielded to internal combustion, and firefighting agencies matured.\n\nBy the mid-20th century the horrific fires had faded, replaced with occasional outbreaks more akin to seasonal flu than an epidemic on the order of the Spanish flu (which, incidentally, had begun earlier in 1918).\n\nNow the flames are back. Why? Because the conditions that spawned the era of frontier fires have found modern surrogates. A new wave of settlement is recolonizing our formerly rural lands, this time converting to towns or exurbs, often out of materials similar to that of their surroundings. Building codes and zoning are often feeble, or have come decades after indifferent attention. Fire protection has strengthened, but it also eliminated, as a consequence, the \"good,\" smaller blazes that had formerly pruned back fuels that might otherwise feed a conflagration.\n\nThe countryside matured, sometimes in unhelpful ways because of the success of fire exclusion campaigns. Geographies that had been painfully segregated remixed as suburbs and pushed against wildlands, while urban enclaves and exurbs found themselves amid revanchist woods. Climate change lengthened fire seasons and worsened some of the conditions that allowed vegetation to convert into fuel. It assumed the role of performance enhancer that slash had earlier previously served. The fires mutated from occasional nuisances into menaces.\n\nThe problem manifested itself most dramatically in postwar California and was dismissed as a California quirk. Then it infected much of the American West with flames rushing around Spokane, Reno, the Wasatch Front, and -- with particular venom -- Colorado's Front Range. Then they moved into the Great Plains, then outside Austin, Texas, the coastal plains, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nAt first, the prevailing narrative was one of dumb Californians (or westerners) putting houses where there were bound to be fires. Increasingly, thanks to climate change and land use, the narrative is becoming one of fires going to where the houses are.\n\nWhat can we do to turn the tide again? We can relearn the lessons of that last-century plague.\n\nMost basically, we need to define the problem correctly.\n\nThe \"wildland-urban interface\" is a dumb, geeky name coined in California in the early 1970s. It viewed the problem of wildfires from the perspective of wildlands. By then the wildland fire community -- that is, the federal agencies (such as the National Park Service and Forest Service) and some state and private institutions that were concerned with fire on landscapes -- had admitted the self-destructive folly of trying to exclude all fire from all lands and had committed to restoring \"good\" fire.\n\nIt defined the problem as one of encroaching houses and the loss of a rural buffer zone. It knew it could not eliminate all fires, and couldn't afford to, since in most landscapes fire was both inevitable and necessary. But it saw those fires getting more savage and knew that new houses compromised attempts to contain fires as a wildland issue.\n\nBut we might equally view the problem from the other side of the interface, that is, from cities and sprawling towns. Suburbs and exurbs are fringes and fragments of cities with peculiar landscaping. They are amenable to the methods that tamed America's urban blazes in that earlier era: fire codes, life safety codes, building codes, zoning, an infrastructure for urban fire protection.\n\nSuch a redefinition makes sense because plenty of research, not only in the US but in Australia and elsewhere, points to ember swarms as the primary ignition source in threatened communities. Blizzards of sparks from an advancing fire act on the structure itself and on the flammable material -- shrubs, mulch and pine needles --immediately around it. This \"home ignition zone,\"as it's called, holds the critical points of vulnerability. It's where fire enters the built environment.\n\nJUST WATCHED California Camp Fire sets grim new records Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California Camp Fire sets grim new records 01:20\n\nSimilarly, we know that fires occur in patterns -- as do winds, such as those blasting California -- and like flood plains, they map zones of high risk. They help identify what communities need the most urgent attention. (Malibu has burned so often, for example, it might make sense to highlight decades without a \"disaster\" fire.)\n\nYes, the countryside needs treatment as well. We can dampen the ferocity of the flames -- the size of fires will depend mostly on the winds, but their intensity will depend on the fuel characteristics of the landscape. The home ignition zone has a counterpart around whole communities -- a \"community ignition zone.\" There are lots of techniques for treating such areas, for fashioning the fire equivalent of greenbelts around communities and municipal watersheds.\n\nWe can also begin to substitute prescribed, semi-tame flames for the feral fires that now result from accidents, lightning, and power lines, which function today as railroads did a century ago.\n\nBut we need to choose solutions that make sense in terms of how fire behaves and kindles structures. Felling the woods will worsen the scene, unless you clean up afterwards. This can be expensive and brings its own hazards from burning the slash, which can lead to other fires and noxious smoke.\n\nWe can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires. We can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe can go beyond thoughts and prayers, and the misbegotten sense that mass burnings must echo mass shootings in their random destruction and our helplessness to stop them.\n\nA century ago the horror of the 1918 outbreak marked a tipping point.

The President also pressed the commanding officer of a Coast Guard ship in Bahrain on trade before touting his trade policies and arguing that \"every nation in the world is taking advantage of us.\"\n\nUS Presidents have traditionally called troops stationed abroad during the holidays to boost morale and remind the country of their service, making Trump's rhetoric yet another striking break from the norms of presidential behavior. After the call wrapped, Trump entertained more than two dozen questions from reporters and once again discredited a CIA assessment about the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\"This was, sadly, predictable and avoidable,\" said retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, a CNN military and diplomatic analyst. \"The President's conduct on that call, the manner in which he politicized it, demonstrated an utter and complete disregard for what military service means.\"\n\nTrump has not shied away from politicizing the military in the past, and on Thursday, he drew on US men and women in uniform to justify his controversial deployment of nearly 6,000 US troops to the southern border. Without evidence, he painted Air Force Gen. David Lyons as a proponent of his hardline immigration policies after Lyons said US troops are fighting in Afghanistan to prevent terrorists from reaching \"our shores again.\"\n\n\"Large numbers of people are forming at our border and I don't even have to ask you, I know what you want to do, you want to make sure that you know who we're letting in. And we're not letting in anybody essentially because we want to be very, very careful,\" Trump said, speaking to Lyons over the phone. \"You're right, you're doing it over there. We're doing it over here.\"\n\nThe topic brought Trump to another familiar airing of grievances, as he complained over the phone to the general that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has \"become a big thorn in our side.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border.

Nobody's concluded. I don't know if anybody's going to be able to conclude that the crown prince did it,\" Trump said. \"They said he might have done it. That's a big difference.\"\n\nTrump continued to defend his decision not to blame the crown prince or issue more severe punishments on a series of false or unsubstantiated claims, suggesting diminished relations with Saudi Arabia would cause \"a global depression,\" result in the loss of \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\" and leave Israel defenseless.\n\nTrump also defended his daughter, Ivanka, after it emerged earlier this week that she had used a private email account to discuss or relay official White House business, a practice evocative of the one for which Trump harshly criticized Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.\n\nHe called her use of personal email -- which appears to have violated federal records laws -- \"very innocent\" and dismissed the comparison to Clinton, saying his daughter's private emails contained no classified information and were never deleted.\n\nAt one point, Trump was asked what he was most thankful for on this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"For having a great family and for having made a tremendous difference in this country,\" Trump said. \"I've made a tremendous difference in the country.

The US Judiciary has strived to be above the political fray that has only been exacerbated by Trump.\n\nRoberts' response stems specifically from Trump's comments on Tuesday on District Court Judge Jon Tigar's Monday night decision to temporarily block an executive order that would have scaled back US asylum policy. Trump criticized the San Francisco-based Tigar, nominated in 2012, as an \"Obama judge.\" Of the regional US circuit court that would oversee any appeal of the case, Trump declared, \"an automatic loss\" for the administration and \"the 9th Circuit is very unfair.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, made public because of a query from The Associated Press, Roberts said, \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Roberts had been asked to comment, but it was the first time he decided to go public. A 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, Roberts did not explain his timing.\n\nBut it may arise from the combination of Trump's specific insult -- portraying Tigar in a political realm based on the president who appointed him -- as well as the recent confirmation turmoil over new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nRoberts' public concern for the reputation of the federal judiciary comes as the Supreme Court is riven 5-4 along ideological and political lines. The recent retirement of swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy has deepened the split, and Roberts has already signaled an effort to try to lessen the divisions among the nine.\n\nThe chief justice spoke out broadly about judicial independence in October after the tumultuous Kavanaugh hearings. Addressing a University of Minnesota audience, Roberts referred to \"the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks\" and then asserted the high court's independence from the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\"I will not criticize the political branches,\" he said. \"We do that often enough in our opinions. But what I would like to do, briefly, is emphasize how the judicial branch is -- how it must be -- very different.\"\n\nRoberts' statement on Wednesday was of a different magnitude, stronger and deliberately echoing back the President's own remark about an \"Obama judge.\"\n\nThe chief justice has often expressed dismay when judges are referred to by political affiliation. He has also observed since 2010, with the retirement of liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, an appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, that it may be more difficult to convince the public of justices' impartiality from politics.\n\nSince Stevens was succeeded by Obama-appointee Elena Kagan, and continuing with Trump's choice of Kavanaugh, the court's five conservative justices were named by Republican presidents and the four liberals -- often relegated to the dissent -- were named by Democratic presidents.\n\nWith Kennedy's retirement, Roberts is now ideologically at the middle of the court, and he may be inclined to hedge his own conservative instincts to steady the bench and avoid more polarization.\n\nAs he considered whether to answer Trump's latest affront to the judiciary on Tuesday, Roberts no doubt weighed how much he might provoke Trump. Roberts plainly concluded it was time to defend judiciary's special role in America's democracy.\n\nThe 63-year-old chief was likely not surprised that within three hours, Trump fired back in two consecutive tweets: \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' but if it is ... are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\"\n\nRoberts offered no new retort. And given the chief justice's aversion to the appearance of politics, he is unlikely to offer any response any time soon."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Top Trump officials saved the President from himself", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/pyVrfCWQQck/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Had President Donald Trump been successful in launching prosecutions against Hillary Clinton and James Comey, it could have spelled the end of his presidency, as a clear-cut abuse of power.\n\nIt never happened, apparently thwarted by then-White House Counsel Don McGahn and other senior officials. But that does not mean this is a crisis dodged for Trump and he is now free from fresh legal and political jeopardy. Quite the reverse.\n\nAt the very least, the latest developments underline how Trump's senior subordinates may have shielded a President unschooled in constitutional norms from disastrous steps that could have put his presidency in peril.\n\nAnd it leaves anyone on the outside wondering what other potential disasters top officials like McGahn, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein might have prevented.\n\nThey also raise questions about the capacity of a now-understaffed White House and legal counsel's operation to protect the President from current or future transgressions.\n\nIt will be impossible to confirm, given the habitual silence from the special counsel's office, but the revelations hint at the possibility that Robert Mueller knows much more about what went on in the corridors of the West Wing than has been publicly revealed.\n\nThat will play into rising tensions in Washington amid expectations that the endgame of Mueller's probe is in sight and speculation about possible indictments targeting Trump world and the content of his final report.\n\nBombshell reports by CNN and The New York Times about the President's intentions emerged on another surreal day in Washington that saw shocking disclosures about Ivanka Trump's emails and a huge foreign policy pivot over Saudi Arabia\n\nThey will bolster perceptions that Trump views the Justice Department as an instrument of his personal power rather than an insulated government department responsible for the neutral administration of justice.\n\nTrump had forecast his intentions\n\nCNN reported Tuesday that the President, on multiple occasions, asked Rosenstein and Matt Whitaker, who was then chief of staff to the attorney general, how they were doing in investigating Clinton.\n\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that Trump had asked McGahn to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and fired FBI Director Comey but that he had been rebuffed.\n\nThe paper, lifting the lid on extreme pressure faced by top law enforcement officials in the US government, also said Trump had repeatedly criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray for failing to more aggressively investigate Clinton, calling him weak.\n\nIt is not surprising that Trump would call for such prosecutions. He has frequently said as much on the campaign trail and on Twitter and beamed as his crowds chanted \"lock her up,\" referring to his 2016 election foe.\n\nBut that he would actually believe he has the power to follow through on his demands and such action would be politically acceptable is the most alarming takeaway from the reports.\n\nA prosecution of Clinton -- possibly over her private email server or an Obama-era uranium deal struck with Russia, both while she was secretary of state -- would have challenged the fundamentals of the political system itself. American democracy since George Washington, the first president, has been assured by the peaceful transfer of power between often bitter rivals. In a saga that became embroiled in the 2016 election, the FBI investigated Clinton's email use, but declined to recommend charges.\n\nMobilizing the government's prosecutorial powers against Comey would represent a vindictive swipe against a political enemy, a worrying sign in itself.\n\nBut it could also have led Trump onto perilous legal ground because he fired Comey and then told NBC News he had done so because of the Russia investigation -- which Comey was then leading -- raising concerns that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dean: Even Nixon would say Trump going too far 01:35\n\nThe dismissal made the former FBI director a key witness in the probe, which was taken over by Mueller shortly after Comey was forced out. Using the federal government to target such a witness would risk playing into the obstruction of justice case that Mueller is investigating, since it could offer evidence for the question of whether the President had acted with malicious intent.\n\nJosh Campbell, who served as an aide to Comey at the FBI and is now a CNN analyst, said his former boss was shaking his head at reports that the President wanted the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\n\"This is what had him worried then. This is what he's been so vocal about now and speaking out,\" Campbell said on \"Anderson Cooper 360.\"\n\nComey wrote in his book \"A Higher Loyalty,\" which came out earlier this year, that Trump often reminded him of a mafia boss and sent him back to his days prosecuting the mob, especially with the President's demands for personal loyalty.\n\nRenewed scrutiny of Matt Whitaker\n\nThe latest revelations also cast new scrutiny on Whitaker, who is now acting attorney general, after Trump fired Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's elevation, and past criticism of the Mueller probe, sparked concerns that he was put in place to thwart the Russia investigation.\n\nA source told CNN's Pamela Brown that Whitaker, in his former role, came to meetings with Trump prepared to answer how the Justice Department was pursuing investigations against the Clinton Foundation and on the Uranium One issue, over a mining company whose sale to Russia's atomic energy agency had been approved by the Obama administration while Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe source said Whitaker tried to appease the President and there was no sign that he had crossed a line.\n\nWhitaker is now in a role in which he oversees the Mueller probe, and thus could face intense pressure from a President who has made no secret of his disdain for an investigation he has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhen Trump first requested the investigations in April, McGahn told the President he could not compel the Justice Department to prosecute people, the Times said. The paper also reported that McGahn had gone so far as to have White House lawyers draft a memo listing the consequences of such a request.\n\nIn many ways, the latest reports underline how Trump, a neophyte in Washington when he was inaugurated in January 2017, does not appreciate or respect normal boundaries between the White House and Justice Department.\n\nThey also suggest how if he is not constrained, the President could accidentally stumble into a position that contravenes the Constitution and puts his presidency in jeopardy.\n\nThat possibility seems to be exacerbated by Trump's increasing self-confidence in a White House that may be about to be deprived of many remaining restraining influences in a government reshuffle.\n\nTuesday's reports recalled an exchange in a Clinton/Trump presidential debate in 2016, when the Democratic nominee remarked that it was good that someone with her rival's temperament wasn't running the country.\n\n\"Because you would be in jail,\" Trump replied."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving dinner: How to find common ground on divisive issues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/I70zlsivI3w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It looks like it's going to be a perfect Thanksgiving. The sides are plentiful, and the turkey is juicy.\n\nThen Uncle Seymour brings up politics. Everyone at the table freezes because half the family leans to the left and half leans to the right.\n\nA suave cousin could steer the conversation toward something less controversial, but sometimes you just can't avoid politics.\n\nHere are five thorny issues that could come up on Thanksgiving Day and how you and your family could find common ground:\n\n1. Gun control\n\nGuns are one of the most polarizing issues in our nation. A slight majority (52%) in a recent Pew Research Center poll believed it was more important to control gun ownership than the 44% who said it was more important to protect Americans' rights to own guns. There is a large gender and partisan gap on the issue. It also splits along urban and rural lines.\n\nFar less controversial is preventing people with mental illness from owning guns. In the Pew poll, 89% of Democrats and 89% of Republicans favor this proposal. A Fox News poll, which phrased the question slightly differently, found that 84% of voters (including 89% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans) favor mental health checks for all gun purchases. One of the big changes to Florida law following the Parkland shooting was to beef up mental health checks . This law was passed with bipartisan support and over the objections of the National Rifle Association.\n\n2. Health care\n\nThere has probably not been a more important issue in American politics than health care over the last decade. Democrats passed Obamacare, which played a major role in Republicans taking control of the House in the 2010 midterms. Republicans then tried to repeal Obamacare, which, in part, led to Democrats winning back the House majority in 2018. More Americans like than dislike the law at this point, though it's still divisive\n\nIt's best to focus on the parts of Obamacare that tend to have much higher support. Specifically, Americans of all political stripes are for ensuring that those with pre-existing conditions get covered. In August, the Kaiser Family Foundation asked Americans how important it was to maintain the law that \"prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person's medical history\" and \"prohibits health insurance companies from charging sick people more.\" Overall, 75% and 72% respectively said it was very important. Even among Republicans, 58% and 56% said it was very important.\n\n3. The Republican tax cuts\n\nSome thought Republican tax cuts passed by this Congress were going to help them maintain their House majority. It didn't. The law has remained relatively unpopular , and it may have cost Republicans House seats in places where residents were hurt by them.\n\nIt's best to steer to conversation toward a tax cut most people support. One reason the Republican tax cut wasn't popular was that most voters thought it was aimed primarily at the upper class . Americans are far more in favor tax cuts in which the middle class would benefit more. During the heat of the tax cut debate last year, 60% of Americans said in a CBS News poll that they would like to see taxes on the middle class decreased. Unlike most other proposals CBS News polled, a tax cut for the middle class received bipartisan support with 69% of Republicans, 57% of independents and 56% of Democrats in favor of one.\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThere have been few issues as polarizing as illegal immigration over the last few years. Indeed, when I looked at which issues generated the greatest difference in response from Democrats and Republicans, the yearning to build a wall along the US-Mexico border came in at No. 1. In an October CBS News poll , 76% of Republicans favored building a wall compared to only 9% of Democrats.\n\nFocus instead on legal immigration. Democrats and Republicans do generally agree on this topic: they like it. In a 2018 Gallup poll , 92% of Democrats said legal immigration is a good thing for the country. Among Republicans, 80% said immigration is a good thing for the country. According to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Americans who want legal immigration decreased has dropped to 24% (a low since at least 2001). Decreasing legal immigration is a minority position among Democrats (16%) and Republicans (33%).\n\n5. Washington politicians\n\nBringing up President Donald Trump at a family gathering is like wearing a New York Yankees shirt in Boston. It's bound to set off long stares and start potential fights. Trump is loved by Republicans and despised by Democrats. Mentioning Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is probably not going to end much better."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Thanksgiving: Watch out for these illnesses tied to recalled foods", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/i0SRD3w4u3Y/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is many Americans' favorite holiday because it is a time when family, friends, neighbors and strangers come together to share their favorite foods. Before you prepare your favorite dishes, take a moment to review the food recalls and illness outbreaks identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRomaine lettuce\n\nJust two days before Thanksgiving, the CDC warned US consumers to not eat romaine lettuce , as it may be contaminated with E. coli.\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC. One of the hospitalized people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a potentially life-threatening form of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.\n\nPeople have become sick in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has identified an additional 18 people who have become sick with the same strain of E. coli in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which is also investigating the outbreak, cautions that if you have any romaine lettuce at home, you should throw it away, even if you have eaten some and did not get sick.\n\nNo one distributor or source has been identified, so the FDA is warning consumers to avoid all types and brands of romaine lettuce. Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants also should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nTurkey products\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak. The CDC announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July, but more people have gotten sick, bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died, and 63 people have been hospitalized.\n\nJennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91,388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a September 11 production, and according to the USDA, the rest of the products shipped nationwide.\n\nThe outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from, as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor, the agency said. This could mean that \"it might be widespread in the turkey industry.\"\n\nLab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products, including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.\n\nThe CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey, make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator, not on the counter.\n\nRaw chicken\n\nIn another ongoing investigation, 92 people have been infected with salmonella infantis in 29 states, linked to raw chicken products from a variety of sources, according to the CDC. No deaths have been reported, though 21 people have been hospitalized, the public health agency reports. The USDA is continuing to monitor this outbreak.\n\nPeople who have become sick report eating different types and brands of chicken products purchased in many locations. The CDC has identified salmonella in samples taken from raw chicken products, live chickens and raw chicken pet food. Because the strain is present in live chickens as well as many types of raw chicken products, this is an indication that contamination might be widespread in the chicken industry, according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, the CDC does not advise consumers to avoid eating properly cooked chicken or retailers to stop selling raw chicken products.\n\nInstead, you need to handle raw chicken carefully and cook it thoroughly to prevent food poisoning, the agency recommends. Wash your hands before and after preparing or eating food, and sanitize your kitchen and preparation area. Chicken breasts, whole chickens and ground poultry, including chicken burgers and chicken sausage, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should also be reheated to that temperature.\n\nGround beef\n\nDo not eat, serve or sell recalled beef products that were recalled by JBS Tolleson Inc. of Tolleson, Arizona, because they may be contaminated with salmonella, the CDC advises. As of Thursday, 246 people have been infected with the outbreak strain of salmonella newport in 25 states, the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported, but 59 people have been hospitalized.\n\nCheck your freezer for recalled beef, the CDC recommends. The company recalled 6.9 million pounds of beef products in early October, all produced and packaged between July 26 and September 7. It was shipped to more than 100 retailers across the nation under many brand names, and the establishment number \"EST. 267\" can be found inside the USDA mark of inspection (but may be found elsewhere on the package), according to the CDC. The list of retailers where these products were sold can be found on the USDA website\n\nCook ground beef thoroughly, the CDC recommends, and handle beef products safely to prevent foodborne illness. Never eat raw or undercooked ground beef. To kill germs, it needs to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash your hands and any item that came into contact with raw beef, including countertops, utensils, dishes and cutting boards, with soap and water, the CDC advises.\n\nDuncan Hines cake mix\n\nA recall was issued for four types of Duncan Hines cake mix due to possible salmonella contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said on November 5.\n\nThe recall was issued by Conagra Brands due to \"a positive finding of Salmonella in a retail sample of Duncan Hines Classic White cake mix that may be linked to a Salmonella outbreak that is currently being investigated by CDC and FDA,\" Conagra said in a statement.\n\nThe DNA fingerprint found in that sample of cake mix matches the DNA fingerprint identified by the CDC in five cases of salmonella illness, according to the FDA.\n\nThe illnesses were reported in Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC said Wednesday.\n\nSeveral of the individuals who are sick told health investigators that they consumed cake mix before their symptoms began, according to Conagra.\n\n\"Two ill people reported eating cake in the week before their illness began and one reported eating raw cake mix, but brand information was not available,\" according to the CDC, which added that it is \"working with state health departments and FDA to determine if these ill people ate cake or raw cake mix produced by Duncan Hines.\"\n\nWho's at risk, and what are the symptoms of foodborne illness?\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming sick due to foodborne illness, though when it comes to infections with salmonella, children are the most likely to get sick, according to the FDA. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSymptoms of salmonella illness usually begin 12 to 72 hours after consuming something tainted with the organism and last about four to seven days. They include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Most people recover without treatment. In some patients the diarrhea can be so severe that hospitalization and antibiotic treatment are required to prevent the illness from spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and elsewhere in the body.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Don't eat romaine lettuce, CDC urges amid E. coli concerns", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/L5eJjqoKvEI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned US consumers on Tuesday to not eat romaine lettuce, as it may be contaminated with E. coli .\n\nThirty-two people, including 13 who have been hospitalized, have been infected with the outbreak strain in 11 states, according to the CDC.

Consumers should not eat any romaine lettuce product, including \"whole heads of romaine, hearts of romaine, and bags and boxes of precut lettuce and salad mixes that contain romaine, such as spring mix and Caesar salad.\n\nRetailers and restaurants also should not serve or sell any until more is known about the outbreak.\n\nIllnesses in the current outbreak started in October, and it is not related to another multistate outbreak linked to romaine lettuce this summer.\n\nA similar outbreak caused by contaminated romaine lettuce occurred in December, Gottlieb said, and affected the United States and Canada. \"The strain in 2017 is the same as the strain in this fall 2018 outbreak, and the time of year is exactly the same. So It's likely associated with end of season harvest in California,\" he said.\n\nWhat's different this year is that the FDA has higher confidence that it's romaine lettuce in both countries. \"This year, we're a month earlier, so we're earlier in the process, earlier in the throes of an outbreak,\" Gottlieb said. \"So we're able to actually get real-time information and conduct effective trace back and isolate what the source is.\"\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, which usually begin about three or four days after consuming the bacteria, can include watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC. Most people infected by the bacteria get better within five to seven days, though this particular strain of E. coli tends to cause more severe illness.\n\nPeople of all ages are at risk of becoming infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, according to the US Food and Drug Administration , which is also investigating the outbreak. Children under 5, adults older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with chronic diseases, are more likely to develop severe illness, but even healthy children and adults can become seriously ill.\n\n\"That's why we think it's critical to get this information out,\" Gottlieb said. \"We understand fully the impact this has, not just on the growers and the distributors but also on consumers -- consumers who are preparing meals for the holidays, who have product now that they're going to need to discard, maybe food that they've already cooked.\"\n\nHow does the US prevent foodborne illness?\n\nFoodborne illness hits one in six Americans every year, the CDC says, estimating that 48 million people get sick due to one or another of 31 pathogens. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die annually.\n\nPreventing foodborne illness in the United States is the job of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which oversees the meat, poultry and processed egg supply, and the FDA, responsible for domestic and imported foods.\n\nWith frequent news of outbreaks, which are investigated by the CDC, many people might wonder whether foodborne illness is on the rise -- and whether safety measures across the nation adequately protect our food supply.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the CDC has investigated 21 multistate foodborne illness outbreaks this year, more than any year in the past decade.\n\n\"I think that the issue isn't that there's more unsafe food,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think what's happening is that we have better technology than ever before to link outbreaks of human illness to a common pathogen.\"\n\nIn all 50 states, the CDC has the capacity to do genomic testing on samples from infected patients (such as blood samples). It also can genetically link the identified pathogens in human illness to actual food sources.\n\nWhat is lagging is the ability to do track and trace to a single distributor or grower \"because we don't have as good a technology as we would like in our supply chain,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother recent development in protecting the US food supply is the Food Safety Modernization Act , which became law in 2011. Gottlieb said the act represents a \"paradigm shift,\" as it is based on prevention instead of reaction.\n\n\"I think food is more safe now than it's ever been. We have much more resources and additional tools to do effective surveillance.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "'Romaine' calm: Funny and meaningful memes to 'lettuce' get through this recall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/zR3r1PvT6wg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Spinach.

Hours later he began to feel unwell.\n\n\"My pupils were like pinpricks and I was quite sweaty and hot,\" said the 38-year-old father of two. \"At the time I put that down to being tired and stressed.\"\n\nBy Tuesday he was so unwell, he was rushed to hospital.\n\n\"It was horrendous, I was confused, I didn't know what was going on and it was really, really frightening,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nDet Sgt Bailey was admitted to Salisbury District Hospital, where doctors tried to find the right combination of drugs to fight the poison in his body.\n\nAt the same time, scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory - at nearby Porton Down - worked around the clock to find out what had poisoned him and the Skripals.\n\nWhen experts discovered Novichok was responsible for the poisoning it was \"a jaw-dropping moment\", Professor \"Tim\", the lead scientist dealing with chemical threats, said.\n\n\"Novichok is one of the most dangerous substances known. It's quite unique in its ability to poison individuals at very low concentrations,\" he added.\n\n'People could die from this'\n\nFor the first time, a nerve agent had been used in an attack in Europe.\n\nDoctors had to break the news to Det Sgt Bailey that he had been poisoned with Novichok.\n\n\"It's the fear of the unknown because it's such a dangerous thing to have in your system. Knowing how the other two were [and] how badly they'd been affected by it, I was petrified,\" he said.\n\nIntensive care doctors at Salisbury hospital were faced with something they had not dealt with before and, according to Dr Duncan Murray, there was \"a very real expectation\" all three could die.\n\nDet Sgt Bailey's treatment was both painful and stressful.\n\n\"I was conscious throughout the whole time,\" he said. \"I had lots of injections\u2026 I had five or six infusions at any one time in my arms. Physically, I felt quite numb after a while.\"\n\nImage caption Dawn Sturgess died after finding the bottle containing the Novichok\n\nOne of the Skripals was being treated in the room next door, which he said was guarded by police.\n\n\"One moment you'd have a nurse coming in with a sandwich for you dressed top to bottom in protective gear,\" he said,\n\nHowever, they might be \"closely followed\" by his wife and children, who were \"allowed to just walk in\".\n\n\"It was very confusing.\"\n\nIt took two weeks of painstaking investigation for scientists and police to work out exactly how the Skripals and Det Sgt Bailey had come into contact with Novichok.\n\nWhen they eventually discovered the nerve agent had been sprayed on the Skripals' front door handle, Det Sgt Bailey said the news helped him.\n\nMask and goggles\n\nHe's still not sure how the nerve agent bypassed the protective gloves he was wearing to get into contact with his skin.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"I could have adjusted my face mask and my goggles while I was in the house, with it being on my hand.\"\n\nDet Sgt Bailey and the Skripals weren't the only ones poisoned by the nerve agent.\n\nFour months later, Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after she and her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok in Amesbury, Wiltshire.\n\nMr Rowley survived.\n\n\"My heart goes out to Dawn and her family because I was able to walk out of hospital and, sadly, she wasn't,\" Det Sgt Bailey said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russian spy poisoning: Why was Sergei Skripal attacked?\n\nIt was the tragedy of Dawn's death that helped detectives solve a vital piece of the puzzle. Charlie had found a perfume bottle and given it to Dawn.\n\nBelieving it was a popular brand of perfume, she sprayed some on her wrists. In fact, officers believe the bottle had been used to smuggle the Novichok into Britain.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, who is leading the investigation, said there was a \"significant amount\" of nerve agent in the bottle - probably enough to kill \"thousands\".\n\n\"The amount that was in the bottle and the way it was applied to the Skripals' home address was completely reckless,\" he told BBC Panorama.\n\nThe UK government blames Russia for the attack.\n\nFor Det Sgt Bailey, it is something he has to come to terms with.\n\n\"It's such an outrageous, dangerous way of doing something that it angered me as well because any number of people could have been affected by that,\" he said.\n\n'Emotional battering'\n\nThe effects have not only been on his health. After finishing work on that fateful day, he unwittingly contaminated his home.\n\nHe and his family have so far been unable to return.\n\n\"Physically I think I bounced back pretty well thanks to the hospital,\" he said. He says the fact he was able to walk out of hospital with his wife after two and a half weeks was \"incredible\".\n\nBut the mental scars he has been left with are a \"different kettle of fish\".\n\n\"I describe it as emotional battering,\" he said. \"It's taken longer to deal with just because of everything that's happened to us.

It's just sad that it's taken 18 months,\" he said.\n\nAnother survivor, Robby Potter, who took his 11-year-old daughter Tegan to the concert, said he was considering taking legal action against MI5.\n\nHis injuries from 37 pieces of flying shrapnel have meant he's been unable to return to his job as a drainage engineer, and now drives lorries.\n\n\"I'd have more respect for them if they had said immediately after [the attack] 'we made a mistake - we underestimated this man',\" he said.\n\n\"I love my country but I was let down. This could have been stopped, and we're finding out now that it should have been stopped.\"\n\nIn their highly-critical report, MPs and peers on the committee also found:\n\nMeasures to control access to chemicals needed for bomb-making were \"hopelessly out of date\"\n\nCommunication companies were still failing to meet their social duties to detect terror planning online - and it recommended putting pressure on them by targeting their profits\n\nThere had also been \"fundamental failings\" by the Home Office, police and Surrey County Council over their handling of the teenager who placed a bomb on the London Underground in September 2017\n\nMI5 should rethink how it \"joins the dots\" on some suspects because it had failed to appreciate the potential dangers posed by Khalid Masood, the Westminster Bridge attacker, despite a trail of evidence over six years\n\nThe committee also attacked the Home Office for failing to properly co-operate over its attempts to investigate how the Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, went undetected.\n\nIt had made \"multiple attempts\" to extract the \"full evidence\" from the Home Office - but the information had not been provided in time.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" said the committee. \"From what we have seen to date there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case by the Home Office, the police and Surrey County Council.\n\n\"This litany of errors will require a separate comprehensive review to which the Home Office must be directly answerable.\"\n\nAnalysis: Intelligence on suspects is fragmentary\n\nSalman Abedi was a \"closed subject of interest\" for MI5 - someone who had once been a cause of concern - but there had been an assessment on the available intelligence that he was not going to turn to violence.\n\nThat meant the 22-year-old went into a pool of 20,000 closed SOIs - people who are not under active investigation anymore.\n\nWhat the review makes clear is that the system for triggering a rethink of individuals in that closed group was too slow to react to a changing picture - and the security service has acknowledged its processes didn't, on this occasion, deliver.\n\nThe big problem is that intelligence on suspects is fragmentary. A British-Libyan young man travelling to Libya is not the stuff of red alerts.\n\nBut his visit to a jailed recruiter and facilitator would have been a relevant piece of information for the review of Abedi that had been planned. That information hadn't reached MI5 before the attack.\n\nAnd that's why the committee says there are really serious questions to be answered by all arms of government over whether everyone is learning lessons from every terrorism conspiracy of recent years.\n\nThe committee said that despite these concerns about government, it recognised that MI5 and the police had taken the mistakes seriously.\n\n\"We note that both MI5 and counter-terrorism policing have been thorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes,\" it said.\n\n\"We also know and acknowledge the determination with which they approach their work, which we regard as impressive.\n\n\"However, it has been striking how many of the issues which arose in relation to the 2017 terrorist attacks have been previously raised by this committee in our reports on the 7/7 attacks [in 2005] and on the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby [in 2013].\n\n\"We have previously made recommendations in all these areas yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons of last year's tragic events must now result in real action.\"\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information-sharing with local authorities.\n\n\"We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,\" he added.\n\nScotland Yard said the police and MI5 have foiled 13 plots since the Westminster attack in March 2017.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: \"We will not let the terrorists who carried out these appalling attacks to succeed in scaring and dividing us.\"\n\nThe Met was, he said, doing more now to improve the handling and assessment of intelligence and making better use of data.\n\nIt is currently handling more than 700 live investigations, involving 3,000 people posing the biggest threat and another 20,000 who are also considered a concern.\n\nTerror attacks in 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n22 March: Khalid Masood runs down and kills four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death outside Parliament.\n\n22 May: Salman Abedi, 22, detonates a home-made bomb in Manchester Arena's foyer blowing crowds off their feet as they leave an Ariana Grande concert.

Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.\n\nA few points to remember\u2026\n\nThis is not a legally binding document.\n\nIt's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).\n\nThis is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.\n\nFormal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.\n\nIt contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come.\n\nHere's an initial look at what's in the text:\n\nFuture relationship\n\nA reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours.\n\nBoth sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.\n\nAgain, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like.\n\nAnd no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.\n\nBottom lines\n\nThe bottom line of both parties is included early on.\n\nAnything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\n\nAnd nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.\n\nTrade in goods\n\nSo trade in goods should be \"as close as possible\", but that's not the same as being frictionless.\n\nIt leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome.\n\nThe two sides are committing themselves to an \"ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced\" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement.\n\nBut there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition.\n\nThe more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.\n\nCustoms\n\nWhen the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit.\n\nDominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world.\n\nThe government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as \"rules of origin\".\n\nThe declaration also mentions explicitly an \"independent trade policy\" for the UK in the future.\n\nIrish border\n\nWe are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open.\n\nThat includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long.\n\nThe trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.\n\nRegulations\n\nUK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come.\n\nIt makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between.\n\nBut none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific.\n\nTrade in services\n\nAs expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of \"equivalence\" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020.\n\nThere's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim.\n\nThere are also plenty of aspirational words on \"ambitious and comprehensive\" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.\n\nDigital commerce\n\nThere are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data.\n\nThe UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy.\n\nBut the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nThis fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop.\n\nThe document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.\n\nFishing rights\n\nThere is neutral language here, including the \"best endeavours\" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal.\n\nBut that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters.\n\nExpect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.\n\nSecurity\n\nThere is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation.\n\nThe EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome.\n\nWe can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future.\n\nDisputes and courts\n\nRather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel.\n\nBut once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end.\n\nTiming\n\nThere is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on.\n\nBoth sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Brexit: A guide to where we are", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46192884", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:42", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit: What just happened?\n\nTheresa May has agreed a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement and a political declaration about future relations between the UK and the EU. It hasn't been painless - two cabinet ministers and two junior ministers resigned while some Conservative MPs want to force a leadership contest. What happens now?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice.\n\nMrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, last week. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.\n\nThe deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWhat has been agreed between the UK and EU?\n\nA draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU.\n\nIt is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.\n\nSo what about a trade deal?\n\nAlongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is that 26-page \"political declaration\" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like. This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.\n\nThe political declaration envisages \"a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\". There would be \"ambitious customs arrangements\" that \"build on\" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop. Here's our Reality Check team's view of the key points of the declaration\n\nHave they solved the Irish border issue?\n\nThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nSo they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBut this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.\n\nMrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nThey could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When will Brexit happen?\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nA \"fair financial settlement\" from the UK - also known as the \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nProtection for 3,000 \"geographical indications\" including Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne and Welsh lamb\n\nWho resigned?\n\nDominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over \"fatal flaws\" in the draft withdrawal agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU \"blackmail\".\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department. Others to go were Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara and Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.\n\nIs there going to be a leadership challenge?\n\nA number of Conservatives have said publicly that they have written letters to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee, made up of backbench MPs - saying they have no confidence in Mrs May's leadership.\n\nThese include the head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former minister John Whittingdale. Party rules say that if Sir Graham receives 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of MPs - it will trigger a vote of confidence.\n\nIf Mrs May wins that a secret ballot, she would be immune from another challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Sir Graham will not reveal the number of letters he receives until he gets to that magic number. More than a week after the rebels went public it seems they have failed to get to the 48 figure.\n\nIt is not yet clear how any of this will affect Brexit and the outcome of talks.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nAn emergency EU summit is due to be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.\n\nWhat about the Commons vote?\n\nIf it hasn't been tricky enough already for Mrs May, probably the most difficult part comes if and when the UK government and the EU have agreed on their preferred Brexit deal.\n\nShe then has to persuade MPs to vote for it. Any vote is expected to take place in the first half of December.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.\n\nIf Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out. On Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was \"no question\" of reopening talks.\n\nMrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, \"nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow\" and it would mean taking \"a path of deep and grave uncertainty\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession.\n\n'Fair and transparent trial'\n\nThis came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added.\n\nMs Tejada later told Reuters: \"Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life.\"\n\nUAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had \"confessed in detail to his crimes\" and was \"accorded full rights\" with a \"fair and transparent trial\".\n\nAbdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: \"Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession.\n\n\"The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted.\n\n\"It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand.\"\n\nThe ministry said the UAE was \"determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally\" and added that it hoped both sides could find \"an amicable solution\" to the case.\"\n\nThe UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal.\n\nAnalysis: Sending a spy 'makes no sense'\n\nFrank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News\n\nBritain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally.\n\nThere are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy.\n\nBritain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase.\n\nThe suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly.\n\nThere is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions.\n\nI've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail.\n\nProf Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be \"some kind of moratorium\" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region.\n\nHe said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and \"there was nothing clandestine or covert\" about the material he had.\n\nProf Jones said there had been no \"inkling\" of any danger and Hedges was \"no stranger\" to the UAE, having \"lived there on and off\" since he was nine years old.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is \"shocked\" at the UAE's verdict\n\nProf Jones said: \"He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him.\"\n\nConservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be \"absolutely disgraceful\" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: \"We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad.\"\n\nHe earlier said the case was \"unacceptable\" and \"consequences must be immediate until he is released\"."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Cycling awareness plan could lead to cheaper insurance for drivers", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46294511", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:46", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nMotorists should be offered cheaper insurance if they take a course to make them more aware of cyclists on the roads, the government says.\n\nThe Department for Transport also wants to give councils more powers to tackle parking in cycling lanes.\n\nIt is proposing a series of 50 measures in a bid to reduce the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed.\n\nLast year, 100 cyclists died on UK roads and 470 pedestrians were killed, an increase of 5%.\n\nA new cycling and walking \"champion\" would be appointed by the government as part of the plans, to make sure the DfT's policies meet the needs of road users across the UK.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I'm going to die on this roundabout' - Watch Graham Simmons' helmet-cam footage\n\nLocal authorities will be encouraged to spend about 15% of their local transport infrastructure funding on walking and cycling.\n\nThe DfT also wants to create a new police unit to analyse evidence of dangerous driving that has been caught on camera by other road users.\n\nThe \"back office unit\", as outlined in the two-year plan, would allow police forces to handle video and photographic evidence that has been captured on devices like dash cams.\n\nIt comes after a similar operation was tried out by North Wales Police in October 2016, leading to the force dealing with 129 cases by the following August as a result of submitted footage.\n\nA review of the Highway Code could also be carried out to consider its guidance about how drivers should behave in relation to vulnerable road users.\n\nAn alliance of walking and cycling organisations - Cycling UK, The Ramblers, British Cycling, Living Streets and Sustrans - said they were frustrated the overall strategy did not place more emphasis on speed reduction.\n\n'Helping save lives'\n\nCycling UK chief executive Paul Tuohy said: \"Lowering vehicle speeds around people walking, cycling and horse riding doesn't just reduce the danger to them, but also their perception of the danger.\n\n\"While the DfT's proposals for amendments to the Highway Code will help save lives, ignoring the threat and dangers of speeding is disappointing.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is the 'Dutch reach'?\n\nCycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said: \"Greater road safety - and especially the protection of vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders - is essential.\n\n\"We want to improve air quality, encourage healthy exercise, reduce obesity and boost our high streets and economic productivity.\n\n\"That means more support for cycling and walking, and that's what these new measures are designed to deliver.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers says \"We are unaware of this proposal.

Indeed, they could even be using social media for support.\n\nAdolescence is key\n\nThe majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders.\n\nThese are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time.\n\nUniversity College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: \"Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.\n\n\"Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people.\"\n\nHow many children get help?\n\nThe NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.\n\nThat is fewer than 3% of the population.\n\nThe figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away.\n\nThis could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams.\n\nBut Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them.\n\nHer report also raised concerns about waiting times.

This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.\n\nDoes that lower rise mean that some progress is being made?\n\nNot so much.

Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.\n\nLevels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.\n\nNitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.\n\nWhat are the implications of all these rises?\n\nEssentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.\n\nThe report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.\n\n\"CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.\n\n\"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Climate change is likely to increase wildfire impacts\n\nWill this new study have any impact?\n\nThe scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nThe WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases.\n\n\"The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,\" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee.\n\n\"The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "InSight: Nasa's Mars mission on target for landing", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46298259", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It takes 6.5 minutes to go from the top of the atmosphere to the surface\n\nThe American space agency Nasa says its InSight Mars lander is on a near-perfect Thanksgiving trajectory.\n\nThe probe is due to touch down on Monday at 19:53 GMT, to begin its quest to map the Red Planet's interior.\n\nEngineers can take the opportunity for one last course correction on Sunday to tighten the line to the bulls-eye - but they may not bother with it.\n\n\"Right now we're looking really good, and we might be able to skip it,\" said Nasa's Tom Hoffman.\n\n\"We'll be working on the final parameters we need over the next few days, so while everybody's off having turkey, there'll be a bunch of people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) making sure we land successfully,\" the InSight project manager told reporters.\n\nJPL in Pasadena, California, is mission control for all Nasa's planetary adventures.\n\nInSight, which launched from Earth on 5 May, has to hit a \"keyhole\" at the top of Mars' atmosphere that measures just 24km by 10km.

Mission statistics show Mars to be unforgiving to the ill-prepared. Two-thirds of all landing attempts have failed.\n\nThe reason is simple: A probe will enter the atmosphere at six times the speed of a high-velocity bullet and then somehow have to slow to a controlled stop at the surface - all inside seven minutes. An EDL strategy has to be perfect.\n\nThe most recent effort in 2016 - from Europe - got it hopelessly wrong and slammed into the ground.\n\nThe Americans, though, have a pretty good record, and InSight will use the proven combination of a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to make its drop to Mars.\n\nJulie Wertz-Chen is part of the InSight EDL team: \"We've done everything we can to try and be successful but it's a really, really difficult thing to do, to land on another planet. We never want to go into it saying 'Oh yeah, no problem, this will work easily!', because you just never know what Mars will throw at you.\"\n\nInSight aims to be the first mission to take a detailed look inside the Red Planet. It will use British and French seismometers to listen for earthquakes, or rather \"Marsquakes\".\n\nThese vibrations will help trace the interior rock layers - from the crust to the core.\n\n\"An earthquake is almost like a little flashbulb,\" explains InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt. \"It illuminates the inside of the planet with seismic waves, and the seismometer is like a camera that picks up those waves and helps put together a picture. Pixel by pixel we get to put together a 3D picture of the inside of a planet.\"\n\nScientists know very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:23", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough it is very unusual for a president to personally criticize judges, Trump quickly responded by questioning the independence of federal judges appointed by his predecessor and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' Trump said via Twitter from his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida.\n\nWhile Trump cited the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling that drew his ire came from a district judge in California.\n\n\n\nTrump has been particularly critical of judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and much of the U.S. west coast. Trump tweeted Wednesday the court, considered by many as the country's most liberal, has become a \"terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace.\"\n\n\n\nThe president has maintained the Supreme Court has overruled the 9th Circuit more than other courts, but studies conducted during the past five years show three others have a higher percentage of their rulings overturned.\n\n\n\nThe controversy began Tuesday when Trump attacked U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, who ruled against his migrant asylum order. The ruling prompted Trump to claim again Thursday, as he has in the past, that the 9th Circuit was biased against him.\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace\" he said.\n\n\n\nRoberts had refrained from commenting on Trump's previous attacks on judges. But after a query Wednesday from Associated Press, Roberts defended the independence of the federal judiciary and dismissed the notion that judges are beholden to presidents who appoint them.\n\n\n\nRoberts, who has often expressed concern about attacks on the judiciary's impartiality, has previously been the target of criticism from Trump. Trump often belittled Roberts during the 2016 presidential campaign, at one point calling Roberts an \"absolute disaster\" after Roberts voted along with liberals in 2012 to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nRoberts was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and has compiled a firmly conservative voting record during his 13 years on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe chief justice's statement came as he adjusts to changes on the Supreme Court. The arrival last month of Trump's second appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, pushed Roberts to the court's ideological center, a position that was held by Justice Anthony Kennedy until he retired in July.\n\n\n\nFormer special assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings, told CNN Thursday the ideological shift on the court may have compelled Roberts to defend the courts.\n\n\n\n\"I think what Chief Justice Roberts feels like his job is now is to look out for the integrity of and the reputation of the entire judiciary.

That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough it is very unusual for a president to personally criticize judges, Trump quickly responded by questioning the independence of federal judges appointed by his predecessor and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an 'independent judiciary,' Trump said via Twitter from his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida.\n\nWhile Trump cited the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the ruling that drew his ire came from a district judge in California.\n\n\n\nTrump has been particularly critical of judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and much of the U.S. west coast. Trump tweeted Wednesday the court, considered by many as the country's most liberal, has become a \"terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace.\"\n\n\n\nThe president has maintained the Supreme Court has overruled the 9th Circuit more than other courts, but studies conducted during the past five years show three others have a higher percentage of their rulings overturned.\n\n\n\nThe controversy began Tuesday when Trump attacked U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, who ruled against his migrant asylum order. The ruling prompted Trump to claim again Thursday, as he has in the past, that the 9th Circuit was biased against him.\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace\" he said.\n\n\n\nRoberts had refrained from commenting on Trump's previous attacks on judges. But after a query Wednesday from Associated Press, Roberts defended the independence of the federal judiciary and dismissed the notion that judges are beholden to presidents who appoint them.\n\n\n\nRoberts, who has often expressed concern about attacks on the judiciary's impartiality, has previously been the target of criticism from Trump. Trump often belittled Roberts during the 2016 presidential campaign, at one point calling Roberts an \"absolute disaster\" after Roberts voted along with liberals in 2012 to uphold President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nRoberts was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush and has compiled a firmly conservative voting record during his 13 years on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe chief justice's statement came as he adjusts to changes on the Supreme Court. The arrival last month of Trump's second appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, pushed Roberts to the court's ideological center, a position that was held by Justice Anthony Kennedy until he retired in July.\n\n\n\nFormer special assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings, told CNN Thursday the ideological shift on the court may have compelled Roberts to defend the courts.\n\n\n\n\"I think what Chief Justice Roberts feels like his job is now is to look out for the integrity of and the reputation of the entire judiciary.

With just a few more weeks to go before Congress adjourns for the year, he has teed up a vote on the nomination of Thomas Farr, 64, to serve as a district court judge in North Carolina.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Farr\u2019s confirmation with a party-line vote back in January, meaning McConnell has waited about 10 months and until after the midterm elections to hold a vote on the floor.\n\nSenators tend to save their biggest fights in the judicial arena for Supreme Court and appeals court nominees, but Farr\u2019s nomination has proved an exception.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe President Trump nominated him, and it\u2019s even harder to believe the Senate Republicans are considering it again,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York in one of about 20 tweets he has sent out in recent days concerning Farr.\n\nFarr has the backing of home-state Sens. Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both Republicans. They have noted that Farr was also nominated to the same position by former President George W. Bush and has a \u201cwell qualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association. They have protested the implication that Farr is racially insensitive or biased.\n\n\u201cI think absolutely destroying a good man\u2019s reputation is inappropriate,\u201d Tillis said before the committee advanced Farr\u2019s nomination.\n\nIn introducing Farr last year, Burr said the judiciary needs good people and he \u201cfills every piece of the word good.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., described Farr as \u201cprobably the worst of the litter\u201d when it comes to Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\n\u201cCould this administration have picked an individual who is more hostile to the rights of minorities than this man? It is hard to imagine,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in the same committee hearing.\n\nGOP leaders in charge of the North Carolina Legislature hired Farr and others at his firm to defend congressional and legislative boundaries that the Legislature approved in 2011. A federal court eventually struck some boundaries down as racial gerrymanders and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision.\n\nFarr also helped defend a 2013 law that required photo identification to vote, reduced the number of early voting days and eliminated same-day registration during that period.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans said that requiring voter ID would increase the integrity of elections. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state provided no evidence of the kind of in-person voter fraud the ID mandate would address. The Richmond, Virginia-based court said the law targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201d\n\nFarr told lawmakers that, as an advocate, he vehemently disagreed with the argument that the North Carolina Legislature sought to curtail the voting rights of people of color or any other voter. But, said, \u201cI am obligated to follow the decision by the 4th Circuit and pledge that I will do so.\u201d\n\nThe history of the particular judicial opening Farr would fill has also contributed to the acrimony.\n\nPresident Barack Obama nominated two African-American women to serve on the court, but neither was granted a hearing and their nominations stalled. If confirmed, they would have been the first blacks to serve in that particular district, which is about 27 percent black.\n\nFarr also served as a lawyer for the re-election campaign of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in 1990. The Justice Department alleged that about 120,000 postcards sent overwhelmingly to black voters before that election was intended to intimidate them from voting.\n\nFarr said he was not consulted about the postcards and did not have any role in drafting or sending them. He said that after he had been asked to review the card, \u201cI was appalled to read the incorrect language printed on the card and to then discover it had been sent to African Americans.\u201d\n\nThe explanation has failed to win over the NAACP.\n\n\u201cThe courts are supposed to be where we can find and seek justice. But Farr\u2019s lifetime crusade is to disenfranchise African Americans and deprive them of their rights,\u201d said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau. \u201cHe belongs nowhere near a bench of justice.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers called on the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, to schedule Farr for another round of testimony about his role in the Helms\u2019 campaign, but Grassley declined.\n\nWith a 51-49 majority, Republicans will have little margin for error in confirming Farr.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has already pledged to oppose all judicial nominees until he gets a vote on legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Migrants in Tijuana Hopeful About Entering US Despite Homeland Security Warnings", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-in-tijuana-hopeful-about-entering-us-despite-homeland-security-warnings/4669043.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has warned Central American migrants seeking political asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico that the Trump administration will not tolerate \"frivolous asylum claims\" or illegal entry.

Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision that established that women have a constitutional right to have abortions.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Ohio House of Representatives last week approved a measure that would ban abortions at six weeks, while an Iowa law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected is tied up in a court battle.\n\nSuch laws are designed to end up before the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative following President Donald Trump's appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe CDC study also showed 91.1 percent of abortions performed in 2015 were in a woman's first 13 weeks of pregnancy.

Questions these days aren't so much about whether she'll run for the Senate or even president, but whether she ought to keep her job at Facebook.\n\n\u201cHer brand was being manicured with the same resources and care as the gardens of Tokyo,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor. \u201cAnd unfortunately a hurricane has come through the garden.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been dealing with hurricanes for the past two years: fake news, elections interference, hate speech, a privacy scandal, the list goes on. The company's response \u2014 namely, Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's \u2014 has been slow at best, misleading and obfuscating at worst, as The New York Times reported last week. That report, and one from The Wall Street Journal , underscored Sandberg's influence at the company, even as Zuckerberg has borne much of the criticism and anger. There have been calls for both to be ousted.\n\nBut because of the way Facebook is set up, firing Zuckerberg would be all but impossible. He controls the majority of the company's voting stock, serves as its chairman and has \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 the support of its board of directors. Essentially, he'd have to fire himself. Firing Sandberg would be the next logical option to hold a high-level executive accountable. Though the chances are slim, the fact that it has even come up shows the extent of Facebook's \u2014 and Sandberg\u2019s \u2014 troubles.\n\nAs chief operating officer, Sandberg is in charge of Facebook's business dealings, including the ads that make up the bulk of the company's revenue. She steered Facebook from a rising tech startup into a viable global business expected to reap $55 billion in revenue this year. The company is second only to Google in digital advertising.\n\nBut she's also gotten the blame when things go wrong, including Facebook's failure to spot Russian attempts to influence U.S. elections by buying U.S. political ads \u2014 in rubles. Though Sandberg has denied knowing that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to discredit activists, she created a permissive environment through what the Times called an \u201caggressive lobbying campaign\u201d against critics. Facebook fired the firm, Definers, after the Times report came out.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on Sandberg or make her available for an interview. A representative instead pointed to Zuckerberg's remarks that overall, \u201cSheryl is doing great work for the company. She's been a very important partner to me and continues to be, and will continue to be. She's leading a lot of the efforts to improve our systems in these areas.\u201d\n\nSandberg, 49, who was hired away from Google in 2008, has been a crucial \u201cheat shield\u201d for Zuckerberg, as Galloway put it, as lawmakers and the public crank up criticism of the 34-year-old founder. In September, Facebook sent Sandberg to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, eliciting a warmer response than her boss did three months before.\n\nSandberg, former chief of staff for treasury secretary Larry Summers, appears more comfortable in Washington meeting rooms than Zuckerberg, who can seem robotic. Her profile is high enough that lawmakers don't feel stilted when she shows up. She's written (with help) two books, including 2013's \u201cLean In\u201d about women and leadership. Her second book, \u201cPlan B,\u201d is about dealing with loss and grief after her husband died unexpectedly. She was the lone chief operating officer among a who's who of tech CEOs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 to meet with Donald Trump a month after his election.\n\n\u201cIt's both who she is and how bereft Silicon Valley is of strong, powerful female voices,\u201d crisis management expert Richard Levick said. \u201cShe has positioned herself as one of those strong voices with \u2018Lean In.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nBut her high profile also makes her more susceptible to criticism.\n\nThe chorus for Sandberg to leave is getting louder. CNBC commentator Jim Cramer predicted Monday that Facebook's stock would rise if Sandberg leaves or gets fired. NYU's Galloway believes both Sandberg and Zuckerberg should be fired for allowing Facebook to turn into an entity that harms democracy around the world.\n\n\u201cEvery day executives are fired for a fraction of infractions these two have committed,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides elections interference, Zuckerberg and Sandberg have been criticized for their slow response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the data-mining firm accessed millions of users' private information without their permission. The pair were silent for days after the news came out.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Zuckerberg told Sandberg this spring that he blamed her and her teams for the \u201cpublic fallout\u201d over Cambridge Analytica. Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Sandberg at one point wondered if she should be worried about her job (though that appears to no longer be the case, based on Zuckerberg's public support).\n\nGalloway said it would look bad for Facebook to fire one of the only top female executives in an industry where women \u201cface inordinately high obstacles to get to leadership positions.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, Sandberg has also been a positive force on Facebook. She was hired to be the \u201cadult\u201d in the room and has filled that role well. She moves comfortably outside tech circles and in public speaking, countering Zuckerberg's shortcomings in that area.\n\nIf anything, Sandberg's departure from Facebook would likely be on her own terms. While Zuckerberg has spent all of his adult life at Facebook, Sandberg had a career before Facebook and even tech, so it is plausible that she would have a life after Facebook, perhaps back in politics.\n\nBut first, she has Facebook's own troubles to deal with. The task seems daunting because its problems might never go away. But Levick believes she can begin to restore her image by acknowledging her role in causing Facebook's problems instead of blaming external forces beyond her control: \u201cThe knee jerk response \u2018poor, poor\u2019 me\u2019 is not the solution.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Easter Island Natives Plead For British Museum To Return Ancient Rapa Nui Sculpture", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/easter-island-statues-return-rapa-nui_us_5bf4bdafe4b03b230f9c8a47", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "The governor of Easter Island made an emotional plea to the British Museum for the return of an ancient sculpture, featuring the Rapa Nui\u2019s famed stone faces, which has been on display in London for 150 years.\n\n\u201cI believe that my children and their children also deserve the opportunity to touch, see and learn from him,\u201d Tarita Alarc\u00f3n Rapu, governor of the Chilean island, said of the sculpture, according to the Agence France-Presse.\n\n\u201cWe are just a body.

Topaze took the Hoa Hakananai\u2019a from the island, reportedly without permission, in 1868. They gave it to Queen Victoria, who then gifted it to the British Museum.\n\n\u201cYou have kept him for 150 years, just give us some months, and we can have him,\u201d Rapu said in tears outside of the British Museum this week.\n\n\u201cWe want the museum to understand that the moai are our family, not just rocks. For us [the statue] is a brother; but for them it is a souvenir or an attraction,\u201d Anakena Manutomatoma, a member of Easter Island\u2019s development commission, told The Guardian in an article dated Nov. 16.\n\n\u201cOnce eyes are added to the statues, an energy is breathed into the moai and they become the living embodiment of ancestors whose role is to protect us,\u201d she added.\n\nmcdermp via Getty Images The ancient moai are one of the most iconic sculptures in the world.\n\nIn recent years, the Rapanui people have ramped up efforts to preserve the island\u2019s indigenous culture and gain independence from the Chilean government, which in 1888 annexed the island. Easter Island is located some 2,200 miles from the South American continent.\n\nThe campaign to return moai to the island is a part of those efforts.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in the past we did not attach so much importance to Hoa Hakananai\u2019a and his brothers, but nowadays people on the island are starting to realize just how much of our heritage there is around the world and starting to ask why our ancestors are in foreign museums,\u201d Rapanui sculptor Benedicto Tuki told BBC.\n\nTuki volunteered to create an identical moai for the museum should it decide to return the original.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it won\u2019t possess the same ancestral spirit, but it will look identical,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only wish is for him to return home; for me this is worth far more than any amount of money.

Nearly 200 scholars from colleges and universities across Texas took issue with listing states\u2019 rights as a cause of the Civil War.\n\nIn a Nov. 12 letter to the state\u2019s education board, the scholars said doing so \u201cresurrect[s] the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 myth, a long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies such as the disenfranchisement of African Americans and Jim Crow segregation.\u201d\n\nRon Francis, a Dallas middle school teacher who testified before the education board this month, put it another way. \u201cThe lies they\u2019re telling are a little smaller than the lies they used to tell,\u201d he told The Texas Tribune.\n\nHistorians have also taken issue with the board\u2019s decision to keep the biblical figure Moses on a list of political thinkers \u201cwhose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents.\u201d The board rejected amendments \u201cto remove a reference to the \u2018heroism\u2019 of the defenders of the Alamo\u201d and \u201cto correct a standard that suggests separation of church and state is not a key constitutional principle,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe board bowed to public pressure to keep former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and author and activist Helen Keller in the curriculums.

Attorney John Dowd then fired off a searing letter disputing Mueller\u2019s authority to question the president. The interview was off.\n\nNearly a year later, Trump has still not spoken directly to Mueller\u2019s team \u2014 and may never. Through private letters, tense meetings and considerable public posturing, the president\u2019s lawyers have engaged in a tangled, tortured back-and-forth with the special counsel to prevent the president from sitting down for a face-to-face with enormous political and legal consequences.\n\nThe prolonged negotiation speaks to the high stakes for Trump, Mueller\u2019s investigation of his campaign and the presidency. Any questioning of a president in a criminal investigation tests the limit of executive authority. Putting this president on the record also tests his ability to stick to the facts and risks a constitutional showdown.\n\nThe process took a significant step forward this week when Trump\u2019s lawyers handed over the president\u2019s written answers to some of Mueller\u2019s questions. The arrangement was a hard-fought compromise. Trump answered only questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election and not questions about whether he has tried to obstruct the broader investigation into potential coordination between Russia and his presidential campaign. It\u2019s unclear whether Mueller intends to push for more \u2014 either in writing or in person.\n\nSpecial counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined comment.\n\nEven those written answers were months in the making.\n\nIn the months following Mueller\u2019s May 2017 appointment, the White House pledged its cooperation, believing it the fastest way to end the investigation. The administration produced thousands of documents sought by the special counsel and made close Trump aides \u2014 including his legal counsel, chief of staff and press secretary \u2014 available for questioning. White House lawyer Ty Cobb predicted the investigation could conclude by the end of that year.\n\nBut it soon became clear that Mueller would want to interview Trump, given his involvement in several events under scrutiny. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey, harangued his attorney general over his recusal from the Russia investigation and dictated a misleading statement about a Trump Tower meeting involving his son and a Kremlin-connected lawyer.\n\nBut Trump lawyers Dowd and Jay Sekulow moved cautiously.\n\nThe last time a president is known to have been interviewed in a criminal investigation was nearly 15 years ago, and a commander-in-chief has not been subpoenaed before a grand jury since 1998, when President Bill Clinton was summoned in the Whitewater case. Trump\u2019s lawyers were mindful such an interview would be a minefield for a president who often misstates the facts. They set out to avoid it however possible, even if it could lead to resisting a subpoena and bringing on a court fight over presidential power.\n\nBut first they tried to head off a request. Trump\u2019s lawyers staked out a bold constitutional argument, declaring they considered his actions as president outside a prosecutor\u2019s bounds. Mueller had no right to question the president on any of his decisions made at the White House, they argued, saying any outside scrutiny of those choices would curb a president\u2019s executive powers.\n\nAt the same time, they worked to undermine Mueller\u2019s case should he choose to challenge that argument. They furnished a trove of White House documents about key moments in the investigation in hopes of undercutting any claim that he could only get the information he needed by questioning Trump, according to people familiar with the strategy.\n\nTrump had other plans.\n\nAs his lawyers plotted to dig in against any interview, he pushed for one, believing it would exonerate him. In January, he burst into a reporters\u2019 briefing with chief of staff John Kelly and insisted he was eager to speak to Mueller. He might do so in weeks, he said, \u201csubject to my lawyers and all of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to do that \u2014 I\u2019d like to do it as soon as possible,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t mention was that his attorneys had already discussed, and scuttled, the planned interview with Mueller. That process had even progressed to discussing logistics with Kelly, who advised of ways White House officials could get people in and out of the building without the press knowing.\n\nBut the interest cooled after Mueller team prosecutor James Quarles dictated over the phone 16 topics Mueller wanted to cover, including Trump\u2019s interactions with Comey, his knowledge of national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s interview with the FBI and his involvement in the Trump Tower statement. Dowd responded that the answers could all be found in documents and witness statements provided to Mueller. He then canceled the interview and days later drafted a feisty letter contesting the interview\u2019s appropriateness and offering extensive explanations on the incidents in question.\n\nThe investigation has been \u201ca considerable burden for the president and his office, has endangered the safety and security of our country, and has interfered with the president\u2019s ability to both govern domestically and conduct foreign affairs,\u201d Dowd wrote.\n\nIn the following months, Trump told some of his closest confidants that he still wanted to interview with Mueller, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to publicly discuss private conversations. The president repeatedly insisted he had done nothing wrong and believed he could convince Mueller of that.\n\nHe told one confidant last spring he was frustrated his lawyers didn\u2019t believe he should do it and snapped that he didn\u2019t understand what was taking so long, according to one Republican in contact with the White House.\n\nTensions were on display at a March meeting where Dowd and Sekulow met with Mueller to discuss the need for an interview. Mueller said he needed to know if Trump had a \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d when he fired Comey, such as by intending to stymie the investigation, according to a person familiar with the encounter. Dowd responded that the question was ridiculous and the answer was obviously no. Investigators at the same meeting raised the prospect of a subpoena if Trump didn\u2019t cooperate, Dowd has said.\n\nLater that month, Mueller\u2019s team produced its most detailed list of questions yet \u2014 dozens, in different categories from Trump\u2019s time as a candidate, through the transition period and into his presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s own views soon began to shift. He had his first misgivings in mid-April after FBI raids on his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, thinking they were a sign that he could \u201cnot trust\u201d Mueller, according to one of the Republicans close to Trump who spoke with the AP.\n\nAs Rudy Giuliani joined Trump\u2019s legal team in April, the White House settled into a new strategy: Drag out the interview drama for months, and use that time to ratchet up attacks on Mueller\u2019s credibility and complaints about the cost and time of the probe, according to the officials and advisers familiar with the strategy.\n\nGiuliani led the charge. His scattershot arguments sometimes frustrated others in the White House, as he frequently moved the goalposts as to what would be required to have an interview. But the effect was to ensure the process would drag out longer.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued complaining about the investigation even as his lawyers quietly negotiated acceptable interview terms.\n\nA key breakthrough occurred earlier this fall when Mueller\u2019s team said it would accept written answers on Russian election interference and collusion. The concession ensured that Mueller would get at least some on-the-record response from Trump. Prosecutors tabled questions about obstruction, reserving the right to return to that area later.\n\nGiuliani seemed to foreclose future dialogue Tuesday, saying, \u201cIt is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhether Mueller agrees is a different story."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Ivanka Trump's 2009 Book Warning On Dangers Of Email Comes Back To Haunt Her", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-emails-book-comments_us_5bf66474e4b0771fb6b5eb97", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump faces a House investigation into her alleged use of a personal email account for government business.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest daughter perhaps should have known better, given how she reportedly wrote about the dangers of communicating via email in her 2009 book The Trump Card: Playing To Win In Work And Life.\n\n\u201cMy friend Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s great attorney general (who is now Governor of New York), tells me that e-mail is the key to prosecuting just about everyone these days,\u201d wrote Trump.\n\nScreenshot/Google Books\n\nTrump added that people \u201ccan be so incredibly slapdash with their electronic messages, as if they were some modern version of smoke signals that can disappear without a trace.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "This Thanksgiving, The Trump Administration Is Taking Land From The Tribe That Welcomed The Pilgrims", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-wampanoag-reservation-thanksgiving_us_5bf5b80de4b03b230f9e44ac", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Isabella Carapella/HuffPost The U.S. government is in the process of terminating the reservation of the Wampanoag, the tribe that welcomed the Pilgrims.\n\nAbout 400 years ago, a man named Tisquantum was kidnapped by an English explorer and taken to Spain as a slave. Miraculously, Tisquantum escaped and returned to the \u201cNew World\u201d and to the coastal village where he once lived. In the years he was gone, his entire family died of disease.\n\nA short time later, struggling, desperate English settlers arrived on the shores where his tribe, the Wampanoag, still lived. Tisquantum was key to their survival. Because of his time in Europe, he could speak English. He helped the settlers plant corn and survive winter, and he brokered a peace agreement, without which their colony \u2015 and, by extension, the United States \u2015 would have never existed. The first treaty and the first land grant to the white settlers in North America were translated by this man.\n\nFew people who celebrate Thanksgiving know Squanto\u2019s full name or the name of his tribe. But without Tisquantum or the Wampanoag, the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock surely would have died.\n\nAnd on this Thanksgiving, the United States government is in the process of terminating the reservation of the tribe that welcomed the Pilgrims.\n\nOn Sept. 7, Cedric Cromwell, the chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe received a letter from Tara Sweeney, the assistant secretary of Indian affairs at the Department of the Interior, informing him that his tribe no longer fit the legal definition of \u201cIndian\u201d and would be losing its reservation status. This is the first time that land held under special status for tribes has been taken out of trust since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cThe same country that we helped form is now turned against us,\u201d Cromwell told HuffPost this week. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frightening that our own country is attacking us during the holiday that we helped establish.\u201d\n\nThe legal battle over the Mashpee reservation started in 2016, when casino developer Neil Bluhm wanted to open a casino in a part of Massachusetts set aside for tribal gaming only. He financially backed a small group of residents from the city of Taunton, where the tribe planned to open a casino, to sue the Department of Interior, demanding the agency revoke the reservation\u2019s trust status. In July 2016, the Taunton residents won.\n\nBut the wording of the court\u2019s ruling kicked the decision back to the DOI, which could have legally affirmed the Mashpee\u2019s trust status and saved its reservation. In September the administration declined to do that.\n\n\u201cBecause the Tribe was not \u2018under federal jurisdiction\u2019 in 1934, the Tribe does not qualify under the [Indian Reorganization Act\u2019s] first definition of \u2018Indian,\u2019\u201d Sweeney wrote in her letter.\n\nThe sprawling 1934 Indian Reorganization Act gave the DOI the ability to take land into trust for tribes. Before 1934, tribes lost 90 million acres to allotment. Since then, tribes have been buying back stolen land within their treaty territories. But tribal ownership of a piece of land does not make it Indian Country. For the tribe to be able to exercise jurisdiction, practice self-governance or operate a casino there, the DOI has to put that land into trust.\n\nFor decades, the DOI put land into trust without hesitation and restored 9 million acres of lost tribal land. With the advent of Indian gaming in the 1990s, this long-established practice suddenly became controversial. Powerful gaming interests started fighting new trust lands to shut out tribes and corner the casino market.\n\nIn 1993, Trump, then a New York real estate mogul deeply invested in Atlantic City casinos, testified before Congress that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was unfair and hurting his business. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same country that we helped form is now turned against us. Cedric Cromwell, chairman, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe\n\nNow he and his administration are still arguing that contemporary tribes are not Indian enough for treaty rights and federal statutes to apply. Under the Obama administration, over 500,000 acres of land were taken into trust. Under Trump, the slow restoration of tribal lands has come to a dead stop. According to the DOI\u2019s legal arguments, if the Mashpee Wampanoag are not Indian enough to have trust land, 128 of the 573 federally recognized tribes in the United States could lose their reservations as well.\n\nWith the Mashpee decision, the country is moving backward.\n\nAfter exhausting his options with the judicial and executive branches, Cromwell is taking his fight to the legislative branch. \u201cCongress has the ultimate plenary authority to protect tribes,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on how we protected the early settlers and helped create this country.\u201d\n\nThe two lawmakers who represent the tribe, Reps. Bill Keating and Joe Kennedy III (both D-Mass.), have co-authored legislation to cement federal recognition of the Mashpee Wampanoag land.

In his opinion, Friedman wrote that \u201cas despicable as this practice may be,\u201d FGM is a crime that should fall under the jurisdiction of states \u2015 not the federal government. He found that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it passed a federal law criminalizing FGM in 1996.\n\nBut some activists are worried about the message that the ruling will send to members of Nagarwala\u2019s religious community, Dawoodi Bohras, for whom genital cutting is still a deeply engrained tradition.\n\nMariya Tehrer is the co-founder of Sahiyo, a group that seeks to end FGM in the Bohra community. Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years. At the same time, since Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, some Dawoodi Bohra women have banded together to publicly defend the practice as harmless, and claim that governmental attempts to restrict it infringes on their religious freedom. Tahrer said she\u2019s noticed a movement to dismiss survivors\u2019 stories as attention-seeking attempts to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the community. And the sect\u2019s religious leaders in Mumbai still largely support khatna, Tahrer said, which makes it harder for local imams in India and the diaspora to publicly speak against it.\n\nStill, Tahrer believes the discussions the Nagarwala case have prompted within the Bohra community are a positive development."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "'Real World: New Orleans' Star Danny Roberts Reveals He's HIV-Positive", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/real-world-danny-roberts-hiv-positive_us_5bf59e4ee4b03b230f9e1a3b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "J.

Instead, their symptoms were similar to those that had previously been associated with hysterical women \u2013 most commonly amnesia, or some kind of paralysis or inability to communicate with no clear physical cause.\n\nEnglish physician Charles Myers, who wrote the first paper on \u201cshell-shock\u201d in 1915, theorized that these symptoms actually did stem from a physical injury. He posited that repetitive exposure to concussive blasts caused brain trauma that resulted in this strange grouping of symptoms. But once put to the test, his hypothesis didn\u2019t hold up. There were plenty of veterans who had not been exposed to the concussive blasts of trench warfare, for example, who were still experiencing the symptoms of shell-shock. (And certainly not all veterans who had seen this kind of battle returned with symptoms.)\n\nWe now know that what these combat veterans were facing was likely what today we call post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We are now better able to recognize it, and treatments have certainly advanced, but we still don\u2019t have a full understanding of just what PTSD is.\n\nThe medical community and society at large are accustomed to looking for the most simple cause and cure for any given ailment. This results in a system where symptoms are discovered and cataloged and then matched with therapies that will alleviate them. Though this method works in many cases, for the past 100 years, PTSD has been resisting.\n\nWe are three scholars in the humanities who have individually studied PTSD \u2013 the framework through which people conceptualize it, the ways researchers investigate it, the therapies the medical community devises for it. Through our research, each of us has seen how the medical model alone fails to adequately account for the ever-changing nature of PTSD.\n\nWhat\u2019s been missing is a cohesive explanation of trauma that allows us to explain the various ways its symptoms have manifested over time and can differ in different people.\n\nNonphysical repercussions of the Great War\n\nOnce it became clear that not everyone who suffered from shell-shock in the wake of WWI had experienced brain injuries, the British Medical Journal provided alternate nonphysical explanations for its prevalence.\n\nA poor morale and a defective training are one of the most important, if not the most important etiological factors: also that shell-shock was a \u201ccatching\u201d complaint. \u2013 (The British Medical Journal, 1922)\n\nShell-shock went from being considered a legitimate physical injury to being a sign of weakness, of both the battalion and the soldiers within it. One historian estimates at least 20 percent of men developed shell-shock, though the figures are murky due to physician reluctance at the time to brand veterans with a psychological diagnosis that could affect disability compensation.\n\nSoldiers were archetypically heroic and strong. When they came home unable to speak, walk or remember, with no physical reason for those shortcomings, the only possible explanation was personal weakness. Treatment methods were based on the idea that the soldier who had entered into war as a hero was now behaving as a coward and needed to be snapped out of it.\n\nLewis Yealland, a British clinician, described in his 1918 \u201cHysterical Disorders of Warfare\u201d the kind of brutal treatment that follows from thinking about shell-shock as a personal failure. After nine months of unsuccessfully treating patient A1, including electric shocks to the neck, cigarettes put out on his tongue and hot plates placed at the back of his throat, Yealland boasted of telling the patient, \u201cYou will not leave this room until you are talking as well as you ever did; no, not before\u2026 you must behave as the hero I expect you to be.\u201d\n\nYealland then applied an electric shock to the throat so strong that it sent the patient reeling backwards, unhooking the battery from the machine. Undeterred, Yealland strapped the patient down to avoid the battery problem and continued to apply shock for an hour, at which point patient A1 finally whispered \u201cAh.\u201d After another hour, the patient began to cry and whispered, \u201cI want a drink of water.\u201d\n\nYealland reported this encounter triumphantly \u2013 the breakthrough meant his theory was correct and his method worked. Shell-shock was a disease of manhood rather than an illness that came from witnessing, being subjected to and partaking in incredible violence.\n\nEvolution away from shell-shock\n\nThe next wave of the study of trauma came when the Second World War saw another influx of soldiers dealing with similar symptoms.\n\nIt was Abram Kardiner, a clinician working in the psychiatric clinic of the United States Veterans\u2019 Bureau, who rethought combat trauma in a much more empathetic light. In his influential book, \u201cThe Traumatic Neuroses of War,\u201d Kardiner speculated that these symptoms stemmed from psychological injury, rather than a soldier\u2019s flawed character.\n\nWork from other clinicians after WWII and the Korean War suggested that post-war symptoms could be lasting. Longitudinal studies showed that symptoms could persist anywhere from six to 20 years, if they disappeared at all. These studies returned some legitimacy to the concept of combat trauma that had been stripped away after the First World War.\n\nAs veterans returned home from the war in Vietnam, combat trauma became less stigmatized. manhhai, CC BY\n\nVietnam was another watershed moment for combat-related PTSD because veterans began to advocate for themselves in an unprecedented way. Beginning with a small march in New York in the summer of 1967, veterans themselves began to become activists for their own mental health care. They worked to redefine \u201cpost-Vietnam syndrome\u201d not as a sign of weakness, but rather a normal response to the experience of atrocity. Public understanding of war itself had begun to shift, too, as the widely televised accounts of the My Lai massacre brought the horror of war into American living rooms for the first time. The veterans\u2019 campaign helped get PTSD included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the major American diagnostic resource for psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians.\n\nThe authors of the DSM-III deliberately avoided talking about the causes of mental disorders. Their aim was to develop a manual that could simultaneously be used by psychiatrists adhering to radically different theories, including Freudian approaches and what is now known as \u201cbiological psychiatry.\u201d These groups of psychiatrists would not agree on how to explain disorders, but they could \u2013 and did \u2013 come to agree on which patients had similar symptoms. So the DSM-III defined disorders, including PTSD, solely on the basis of clusters of symptoms, an approach that has been retained ever since.\n\nThis tendency to agnosticism about the physiology of PTSD is also reflected in contemporary evidence-based approaches to medicine. Modern medicine focuses on using clinical trials to demonstrate that a therapy works, but is skeptical about attempts to link treatment effectiveness to the biology underlying a disease.\n\nToday\u2019s medicalized PTSD\n\nPeople can develop PTSD for a number of different reasons, not just in combat. Sexual assault, a traumatic loss, a terrible accident \u2013 each might lead to PTSD. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 13.8 percent of the veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan currently have PTSD. For comparison, a male veteran of those wars is four times more likely to develop PTSD than a man in the civilian population is. PTSD is probably at least partially at the root of an even more alarming statistic: Upwards of 22 veterans commit suicide every day.\n\nTherapies for PTSD today tend to be a mixed bag. Practically speaking, when veterans seek PTSD treatment in the VA system, policy requires they be offered either exposure or cognitive therapy. Exposure therapies are based on the idea that the fear response that gives rise to many of the traumatic symptoms can be dampened through repeated exposures to the traumatic event. Cognitive therapies work on developing personal coping methods and slowly changing unhelpful or destructive thought patterns that are contributing to symptoms (for example, the shame one might feel at not successfully completing a mission or saving a comrade). The most common treatment a veteran will likely receive will include psychopharmaceuticals \u2013 especially the class of drugs called SSRIs.\n\nMindfulness therapies, based on becoming aware of mental states, thoughts and feelings and accepting them rather than trying to fight them or push them away, are another option. There are also more alternative methods being studied such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing or EMDR therapy, therapies using controlled doses of MDMA (Ecstasy), virtual reality-graded exposure therapy, hypnosis and creative therapies. The military funds a wealth of research on new technologies to address PTSD; these include neurotechnological innovations like transcranial stimulation and neural chips as well as novel drugs.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that patients improve most when they\u2019ve chosen their own therapy. But even if they narrow their choices to the ones backed by the weight of the National Center for PTSD by using the center\u2019s online Treatment Decision Aid, patients would still find themselves weighing five options, each of which is evidence-based but entails a different psychomedical model of trauma and healing.\n\nThis buffet of treatment options lets us set aside our lack of understanding of why people experience trauma and respond to interventions so differently. It also relieves the pressure for psychomedicine to develop a complete model of PTSD. We reframe the problem as a consumer issue instead of a scientific one.\n\nThus, while WWI was about soldiers and punishing them for their weakness, in the contemporary era, the ideal veteran PTSD patient is a health care consumer who has an obligation to play an active role in figuring out and optimizing his own therapy.\n\nAs we stand here with the strange benefit of the hindsight that comes with 100 years of studying combat-related trauma, we must be careful in celebrating our progress. What is still missing is an explanation of why people have different responses to trauma, and why different responses occur in different historical periods. For instance, the paralysis and amnesia that epitomized WWI shell-shock cases are now so rare that they don\u2019t even appear as symptoms in the DSM entry for PTSD. We still don\u2019t know enough about how soldiers\u2019 own experiences and understandings of PTSD are shaped by the broader social and cultural views of trauma, war and gender. Though we have made incredible strides in the century since World War I, PTSD remains a chameleon, and demands our continued study."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Gentrification Might Improve Health For Neighborhoods But Not For Cities", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gentrification-health-research_us_5bf56465e4b03b230f9d62c1", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "AFP New Yorkers rallied against Amazon's plans to locate one of its two new headquarters in Queens, New York, which many fear will increase gentrification in the borough.\n\nWhile academics have spent decades examining how gentrification \u2015 the phenomenon by which upwardly mobile newcomers move into working class neighborhoods, prompting rising rents and cultural changes \u2015 affects housing prices, the economy and crime, research into how gentrification affects residents\u2019 health and well-being is comparatively sparse.\n\nA new study, which found a link between healthier neighborhoods and gentrification in cities across the county, complicates the picture even more.\n\nJoseph Gibbons, lead author of the study and assistant professor of sociology at San Diego State University, cautioned that an association between healthier neighborhoods and gentrification didn\u2019t translate to better city health overall.\n\n\u201cWe hope that policymakers interpret these results as indicating investing in disadvantaged neighborhoods can have positive outcomes but recognizing those outcomes may be limited to small areas,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cWe cannot rely on half-measures to solve our problems.\u201d\n\nExisting studies on gentrification looked at city-specific or neighborhood-specific health effects of gentrification.

Dina Merhbi, a registered dietitian in Montreal and founder of the Body Balance Method, said that even one nightmare can increase your fatigue, which may lead to unhealthy habits the next day.\n\n\u201cSleep is a time for the body to relax and reboot for the next day,\u201d Merhbi said. \u201cHowever, nightmares cause a high anxiety state that actually prevents the body from relaxing, and will cause changes in the next day like increased fatigue, heightened senses, [and] increased caffeine and sugar intake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long term,\u201d she said, \u201cwith recurrent nightmares, this will impact the energy and mental health of the person and might become a catalyst for depression, anxiety and even health issues such as glucose intolerance and high blood pressure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the link is not fully understood, experts have found a connection between frequent nightmares and mental health problems. Studies have found that people experiencing regular nightmares are at a higher risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nSo how do you get control over your nightmares? One way is to look at what could be contributing to them. Below are a few things that could be adding to the problem, according to experts:\n\nYou\u2019re dealing with mental health problems.\n\nLuis Alvarez via Getty Images\n\nAccording to John Mayer, a clinical psychologist practicing in Chicago, negative thinking and unresolved issues play a huge role in determining what kind of nightmares, and how many of them, you might have.\n\n\u201cOur brains work like a computer; what goes in equals what comes out,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cSo, if you go to bed with negative thoughts or you\u2019re replaying negatives from your day, boom! Your brain is going to be loaded with negative thoughts to recycle while you sleep.\u201d\n\nOne Finnish study found that people who have severe depression or even just a negative self-attitude were likely to have more nightmares. In fact, 28 percent of their participants who had severe depression also reported having frequent nightmares.\n\nWhile depression is definitely a factor, general stress from everyday life can also have a significant impact on bad dreams and sleep quality. Common circumstances, such as moving, having an upcoming test or changing roles at work, can trigger a nightmare. Grief and other serious issues can also increase your risk.\n\n\u201cStress, unresolved conflicts and personal tragedies all contribute toward generating nightmares,\u201d said Damian Sendler, a clinician who specializes in treating patients with psychological and psychiatric conditions in New York. \u201cNightmares are \u2014 in a way \u2014 the pimples of our imagination. Just as with pimples that show up after there is an excessive accumulation of dirt and bacteria in the skin, nightmares are the byproduct of the mind corrupted by troubles and worries.\u201d\n\nYou have certain personality traits.\n\nSome research has indicated that character traits may contribute to bad dreams. A 2001 study looked at people who were experiencing around two nightmares a month and found that those who are more sensitive are more likely to have frequent bad dreams. Another study discovered that people with artistic and creative interests are also more likely to experience nightmares on a regular basis.\n\nAustrian-American psychoanalyst and sleep researcher Ernest Hartmann found that people with thinner personality boundaries \u2014 those who are open-minded, sensitive and creative \u2014 are more likely to have longer, vivid, detailed and emotional dreams. And that dream content usually \u201cshowed a trend towards correlation with aggressive interaction and nightmare-likeness.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re processing a trauma.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, nightmares are a major symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. This can make it difficult to fall asleep again, which can in turn make the whole next day more challenging.\n\n\u201cSome people wake with a sad or scared feeling after nightmares, which can be a difficult start to the day,\u201d said Alex Dimitriu, a physician and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine. \u201cIf this occurs rarely, it is quite normal. However, regular frequent nightmares can be a sign of either some repressed memory, trauma, or possibly sleep apnea or sleep disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople with PTSD are most commonly known to experience recurring nightmares, often around the traumatic event,\u201d Dimitriu said. \u201cIn these instances, we always advise seeking professional help.\u201d\n\nYou ate before bed.\n\nAJ_Watt via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s pretty well understood that late-night snacking isn\u2019t the best thing for your health, but you might not realize it could be the source of your nightmares. Eating a big meal, or even just a snack, increases your metabolism and body temperature. This causes your brain to be more active, and thus could lead to more nightmares.\n\nA 2015 study by the University of Montreal found that 9.5 percent of people had bad dreams after indulging in a late-night meal. Another 2015 study surveyed almost 400 students and had them keep a record of their dreams, and of what they ate, for two weeks. About 44 percent of people reported that ice cream and other dairy products caused bizarre and disturbing dreams. And there\u2019s even some evidence to suggest spicy foods can lead to nightmares.\n\nYou had a nightcap.\n\nWhile drinking alcohol might initially help you fall asleep, your night is going to be anything but restful. At some point, the alcohol metabolizes and the sedative effect wears off, creating fragmented sleep and nightmares, according to the Cleveland Clinic. And thanks to that vodka tonic, your dreams and nightmares will be way more vivid than usual. There\u2019s even a chance you\u2019ll \u201cact out\u201d your dreams or sleepwalk.\n\nYour medication is messing with your sleep.\n\nCertain drugs may also affect nightmares. According to the Mayo Clinic, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, antihistamines (found in sleep aids and allergy medicines) and steroids are some of the typical offenders. Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cholesterol-lowering medications can also contribute to disturbed sleep and bad dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 1 to 5 percent of people who take these medications and have nightmares \u2015 and it\u2019s affecting your quality of life \u2015 check in with your doctor.\n\nHow can you prevent nightmares?\n\nAdene Sanchez via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to treating any mental health issues, watching your eating habits before bed and talking to your doctor about medication intake, there are a few things you can do to make sure you get a good nightmare-free sleep. Healthy lifestyle habits like meditation, therapy, exercise and journaling can help improve sleep, which in turn may help with your nightmares.\n\nAlex Tran, a wellness expert and yoga teacher in California, said that meditation helped her clear negative thought patterns from her abusive childhood that she believed were contributing to her frequent nightmares.\n\n\u201cI grew up having nightmares two to three times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI found yoga in my early 20s, and the physical practice introduced me to the meditative practice. This has allowed me to clear my thoughts while drifting into sleep, get rid of my nightmares and enjoy a peaceful sleep.\u201d\n\nBecause nightmares can sometimes be a sign of an unresolved issue or conflict in your life, Dara Bushman, a licensed clinical psychologist practicing in South Florida, said acknowledging the problem before you fall asleep could also help with prevention.\n\n\u201cFrequent nightmares are often the result of the mind processing a prior event,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mind does not respond to \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 think of something. In fact, when you drive by a car accident, and someone tells you not to look, the first thing someone does is look. You can prevent nightmares by thinking of the uncomfortable stimulus.\u201d\n\nDream expert and author Lauri Loewenberg suggests that nightmares are not something to be feared. Rather, they\u2019re a tool to help you manage and assess your overall well-being.\n\n\u201cThe occasional nightmare may keep you from being able to fall back asleep and have you a bit upset the following day but is typically not harmful,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can be very good for you because it is the subconscious alerting you to something that is wrong in your life [like] a difficult, ignored or mishandled issue that needs attention and correction.\u201d\n\nSo next time you find yourself jolted awake after being chased by a monster in your sleep, ask yourself what that monster might represent. It could be the first step to put it \u2014 and the rest of your nightmares \u2014 away for good."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Admits To Targeting Billionaire George Soros In PR Attack", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-target-george-soros-billionaire_us_5bf5d6f2e4b0771fb6b5b1ec", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook officials on Wednesday admitted to digging up dirt on Jewish billionaire George Soros and its competitors less than a week after The New York Times published an explosive expos\u00e9 on the tech giant.\n\nElliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s head of communication and policy, published a blog post detailing the company\u2019s decision to hire Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, and why it aimed its effort at the company\u2019s critics, including Soros.\n\n\u201cSome of this work is being characterized as opposition research,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cBut I believe it would be irresponsible and unprofessional for us not to understand the backgrounds and potential conflicts of interest of our critics.\u201d\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied having any knowledge of the company\u2019s PR campaign against Soros until the Times investigation, which also found negative campaigns aimed at Apple and Google, was made public.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, also denied having knowledge of the hiring of Definers.

Instead, the authorities narrowed Skyway in the center of town to improve pedestrian safety, reduce traffic and promote commerce \u2014 a decision that is sure to be scrutinized in the aftermath of the Camp Fire. Eric Reinbold, the police chief of Paradise, was skeptical that removing a lane from parts of the downtown area made the evacuation more difficult. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it would have made a difference or not,\u201d Chief Reinbold said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t evacuate that many people in minutes or hours.\u201d\n\nA recent editorial in the The Chico Enterprise-Record described the town\u2019s preoccupation with emergency evacuations in recent years. \u201cPeople prepared.

The hurricane killed 1,800 and destroyed more than 800,000 housing units, leaving many homeless.\n\nThe federal government, particularly FEMA, was blamed for many of those issues because the agency underestimated the impact of the storm and did not stock supplies beforehand at designated shelters like the Superdome.\n\nIn addition, Michael D. Brown, the director of the agency at the time, had relatively little experience dealing with disasters and emergency response. Before joining the Bush administration, he was the commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association and landed his job at FEMA through his friendship with a longtime Bush adviser.\n\nThat spurred a number of changes at the agency, like mandating that the FEMA chief have experience managing emergencies. The agency also began positioning supplies before natural disasters so that it could get them to those affected faster."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Federal Ban on Female Genital Mutilation Ruled Unconstitutional by Judge", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/health/fgm-female-genital-mutilation-law.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:49", "body_paragraphs": "More than two decades ago, Congress adopted a sweeping law that outlawed female genital mutilation, an ancient practice that 200 million women and girls around the world have undergone. But a federal court considering the first legal challenge to the statute found the law unconstitutional on Tuesday, greatly diminishing the chances of it being used by federal prosecutors around the country.\n\nA federal judge in Michigan issued the ruling in a case that involved two doctors and four parents, among others, who had been criminally charged last year with participating in or enabling the ritual genital cutting of girls. Their families belong to a small Shiite Muslim sect, the Dawoodi Bohra, that is originally from western India.\n\nThe case, the first to be brought under the 1996 law that criminalized female genital mutilation, has been closely followed by human rights advocates and communities where cutting is still practiced and whose members have moved in growing numbers to the United States and other western countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Bernard Friedman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that Congress did not have the authority to pass the law against female genital mutilation and he dismissed key charges filed against the doctors and removed four of the eight defendants from the case."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Do Not Eat Romaine Lettuce, Health Officials Warn", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/health/romaine-ecoli-outbreak-cdc.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-22 19:01:50", "body_paragraphs": "The warning came just as millions of Americans were preparing for the biggest food holiday of the year.

In 2016, a team of scientists declared the upper limit to be 115 years.

He recruited obese people to stay at the hospital and subsist on a 600-calorie a day liquid diet until they reached a normal weight.\n\nThe subjects lost 100 pounds on average, and they were thrilled. But as soon as they left the hospital, the pounds piled back on.\n\nDr. Hirsch and Dr. Rudy Leibel, now at Columbia University, repeated the study again and again, with the same result. Eventually, they found that when a very fat person diets down to a normal weight, he or she physiologically comes to resemble a starving person, craving food with an avidity that is hard to imagine.\n\nThe lesson never really penetrated the popular consciousness. Just a couple of years ago, Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, made headlines with a study of contestants from the Biggest Loser television show. They lost enormous amounts of weight, he found, but rarely could keep it off."}]
