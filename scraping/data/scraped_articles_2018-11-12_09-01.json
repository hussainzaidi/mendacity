Then it was a stately gesture to illustrate an alliance he's done little to cultivate. After a midterm election drubbing , it was an opportunity to retreat and regroup.\n\nYet by the time US President Donald Trump departed Orly Airport on Sunday, 44 hours after he arrived, the reasons for his trip to Paris had become largely obscured. It did less to bolster the transatlantic partnership than to expose its cracks . The 3,800 miles the President put between himself and Washington did little to buffer the boiling political crises back home\n\nAnd it was decidedly gloomier than the procession of tanks and troops Trump originally envisioned rolling through Washington on this date more than a year ago.\n\nOfficials scrambled to put something together and set a tentative date of November 11. But when estimates for Trump's military parade soared to nearly $100 million , officials realized they needed a backup plan to convince Trump a parade was too exorbitant. In the end, they persuaded him that dozens of other world leaders would be in Paris for the commemoration, and he needed to be, too.\n\nBut if Trump came to Paris expecting a parade that echoed the one he witnessed last summer, he was disappointed. The events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I were solemn and stately, and the wet streets of Paris were largely empty as the procession got underway Sunday.\n\nMissed moment?\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron on Trump cemetery controversy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron on Trump cemetery controversy 01:44\n\nAs early as Saturday afternoon, the reasons for Trump to be in Paris at all had become obscured. Homebound at the US ambassador's residence after foul weather forced the cancellation of a trip to an American burial ground, the President was invisible as his European counterparts memorialized the World War I slaughter across the former Western Front.\n\nThe White House declined to say how he spent the empty hours, though Trump tweeted in the evening he'd had \"some very productive meetings and calls for our country today.\"\n\nThe dire political predicament weighing on Trump cannot have been far from mind, despite the thousands of miles separating Paris and Washington.\n\nFresh off a midterm election that cost his party control of the House of Representatives, Trump kept an eye on his domestic difficulties while abroad. He accused election officials of rigging the vote in two US Senate races, repeated his claim that he does not personally know the man he tapped to become the acting attorney general and threatened to cut federal aid while blaming the deadly wildfires in California on \"poor\" forest management\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly visits the Aisne Marne American Cemetery near the Belleau Wood battleground, in Belleau, France, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)\n\nOfficially, the reason for scrapping the journey to the Aisne-Marne American cemetery came down to safety: the President's Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials and not the President. But there did not appear to be a backup plan and the President did not make any statements of regret at not being able to visit the cemetery.\n\nLate Sunday, the White House defended the President's decision not to attend, citing concerns about disrupting traffic.\n\n\"A car ride of two-and-a-half hours, each way, would have required closures to substantial portions of the Paris roadways for the President's motorcade, on short notice,\" said press secretary Sarah Sanders. \"President Trump did not want to cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people.\"\n\nThe optics were undeniably bad, partly because the episode only appeared to confirm the suspicions of Trump's critics that he is uninterested in carrying out the traditional duties of the commander in chief. While reasonable-sounding to those familiar with presidential travel logistics, the White House's explanations for the cancellation appeared inauthentic to casual observers.\n\nWhite House officials were confident early Sunday that those criticisms would evaporate after the President's appearance at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial, where more than 1,500 American soldiers are buried. His remarks, they said, would be the highlight of the trip. Trump addressed the crowd mutedly for roughly 10 minutes before leaving for the airport.\n\nIf the weather imbroglio was concerning him, it did not show.\n\n\"You look so comfortable up there under shelter as we're getting drenched,\" he called out to a group of American veterans. \"You're very smart people.\"\n\nNationalism in the crosshairs\n\nEarlier Sunday, as world leaders gathered under misting rain at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Trump opted to head directly to the Arc de Triomphe, where the ceremony was being held. Driving down a deserted Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a topless female protester breached the barricade lining the famous Parisian avenue and came within feet of the President's motorcade before she was apprehended by French security officials.\n\nThe dozens of other leaders who met at the French President's residence beforehand arrived in coach buses moments later, leaving Trump out of a striking scene as they marched down the street together with black umbrellas held over their heads, led by Macron. The White House said the President arrived separately because of \"security protocols.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and flashed Trump a thumbs up before taking his place on the riser.\n\nThe imagery may have been rooted in logistics, but as France and its European partners fret about the alliance forged with the United States in bloody conflict a century ago, it mattered. Trump has shown little appetite for strengthening the relationships that have underpinned transatlantic relations since the end of World War I, instead lambasting traditional US partners on trade and the cost of security.\n\nHe's shown more affinity for strongmen leaders who have eroded democracy in their countries, like Putin, with whom he spoke at a lunch on Sunday, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who sat alongside him at dinner on Saturday.\n\nThat's left leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Macron, who put forth well-publicized displays of unity this weekend, to urgently warn of backsliding into history's darkest moments.\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron warns of the perils of nationalism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron warns of the perils of nationalism 01:06\n\nMacron offered a clear message about the dangers of nationalism while hosting the ceremony commemorating the armistice Sunday. With Trump -- a self-declared \"nationalist\" -- seated stone-faced in front of him, Macron delivered a stinging rebuke of the US President's \"America First\" agenda.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" Macron said. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying 'our interests first; who cares about the others?', we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great, and what makes it essential \u2014 its moral values.\"\n\nMacron later warned that \"the old demons\" have resurfaced, declaring that \"giving into the fascination for withdrawal, isolationism, violence and domination would be a grave error\" for which future generations would hold them accountable."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "French leader rebukes nationalism as Trump looks on", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ZkQzIPUpBdM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Paris (CNN) Marking the breakout of peace after World War I , President Donald Trump on Sunday heard a dire warning from his host: the forces that led to the slaughter are resurgent.\n\nTrump and dozens of his global counterparts gathered at the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris to mark 100 years since the nightmares of World War I ended, a conclusion brought about partly by the entry of the United States into the bitter, nationalism-fueled conflict.\n\nBut decades later, as living memories fade of the trenches and the poison gas, nationalism is on the rise. It's been fueled by Trump himself, who has proudly identified himself as a nationalist as he advances an \"America First\" agenda.\n\nIn his address, French President Emmanuel Macron -- who has emerged as Europe's most vocal sentry against a global tide of nationalism -- repeated his warnings.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" he said through a translator. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\n\"I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death,\" he said. \"History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"\n\nIt was impossible to view his remarks as anything less than a rebuke of Trump, who has proudly espoused an \"America First\" foreign policy. Speaking later at an American cemetery in Paris, Trump did not directly respond, choosing instead to stick to a brief speech honoring the war dead.\n\n\"Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior -- great, great warriors they are -- who gave everything for family, country, God and freedom,\" Trump said in the 10-minute speech, which was the centerpiece of his visit to Paris for the armistice centenary.\n\nTrump arrived separately from other foreign leaders to Sunday's armistice centenary ceremonies, which occurred under gray skies and cold drizzle. His counterparts, including Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, convened at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace before traveling together in motor coaches to the Arc de Triomphe. They walked in a large group to the event site under black umbrellas.\n\nInstead, Trump pulled up in his own vehicle and walked in separately, due to \"security protocols,\" according to the White House. A topless protester breached a police barricade and ran toward Trump's motorcade before being apprehended. Russian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and walked in solo, flashing Trump a brief thumbs-up as he took his place among the leaders.\n\nThe ceremony in Paris was the largest of events across Europe and in the United States commemorating the armistice . Queen Elizabeth II led members of the royal family -- including William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- at the Cenotaph in central London for a solemn ceremony.\n\nIn Washington, the role traditionally played by the President at Arlington National Cemetery was assumed this year by Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie who placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\nThe armistice that took effect at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 ended what was then the war meant to end all wars. When conflict broke out on the continent two decades later, the United States was again pulled into bloody battle, cementing its role in maintaining European security.\n\nVisiting Paris this week, Trump has bemoaned the cost to the US of helping maintain European security, insisting countries here do more to protect themselves. The cost of securing Europe is a reliable b\u00eate noire for Trump, one he's railed against on the campaign trail and in meetings with his counterparts.\n\nHis actions have raised questions about the state of longstanding US relationships.\n\nThe man who was once his top European partner, Macron, now appears to have become just another world leader subject to ill-timed insults and jabs. Trump's other counterparts -- British Prime Minister Theresa May and Germany's Merkel -- have also been subject to ridicule.\n\nTrump did not appear overly eager on Saturday to dispel the notion he is uninterested in bettering US-Europe ties. During a morning meeting with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored the two men's relationship were gone, replaced by wooden expressions of cooperation.\n\nLater, the President canceled a planned visit to an American cemetery 50 miles outside of Paris. The White House cited the rain, which sometimes grounds the President's Marine One helicopter.\n\nHe remained out of view for most of the afternoon, even as fellow leaders -- including Macron, May, Merkel and Trudeau -- fanned out across the French countryside to mark the solemn anniversary at hallowed locations along the former Western Front.\n\nOn Sunday, the President to make up for the cancellation, which drew criticism and accusations he was ignoring the sacrifice of American military personnel who died in World War I.\n\nFollowing the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe -- which featured a review of troops, musical performances and Macron's address -- Trump attended a lunch for all the world leaders.\n\nAfterward he traveled the short distance to Suresnes American Cemetery, perched on Mont Val\u00e9rien with a panoramic view of the French capital.\n\n\"Through rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and more, they held the line and pushed onward to victory,\" Trump said of the soldiers who died for the allied cause a century ago. \"A great, great victory. A costly victory but a great victory.\"\n\nTrump was due back in Washington by Sunday evening.\n\nThe visit to Paris came about after Trump scrubbed plans for a military parade in Washington, deeming the $90 million price tag too steep . He originally devised the parade having been inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in Paris last year, which featured tanks, troops in formation and aircraft flyovers.\n\nSunday's ceremony occurred in the same vicinity but wasn't be as overly militaristic; it was intended to commemorate the end of war and not the practice of it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Topless protester rushes Trump motorcade", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/e91dk_IlRkI/topless-woman-protester-trump-motorcade-france-bell-cnni-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hamas ordered post offices to remain open on Friday and Saturday -- the normal weekend in Gaza -- to handle the cash disbursements, a Hamas spokesman told CNN.\n\nPalestinians gather to receive the cash that was brought into Gaza through Israel on Thursday by Qatar's envoy to Gaza.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday at a power plant in Gaza, Al Emadi said: \"The policy of the state of Qatar in support of the Palestinian cause during the past years leaves no room for doubt or explanation.\"\n\nThe cash transfer comes just a few weeks after Qatar began sending urgently needed fuel into Gaza to power the coastal enclave's power plant. The fuel supply increased the electricity in Gaza from about four hours a day to eight hours in an effort to alleviate the humanitarian crisis there.\n\nA spokesman for Hamas, Abdel Latif al-Qanua, told CNN on Sunday: \"These Qatari efforts that started months ago ended successfully in the past 48 hours.\"\n\nHe said the money would be used to pay for salaries, while also contributing to medical care of the wounded after often violent clashes along the Gaza border.\n\nNegotiations for the financial package to Gaza began months earlier, following the Palestinian Authority's decision to cut salaries of employees in Gaza last year, an Israeli government source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The sanctions against Gaza were an attempt to put economic pressure on Hamas to relinquish control of the coastal enclave to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn late June, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman met Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Cyprus to finalize the financial arrangement, according to Israeli news site Walla! News. Lieberman had been in Cyprus for a trilateral meeting with the Greek and Cypriot defense ministers.\n\nRight-wing Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who has been critical of any arrangement with Hamas, acknowledged the communications between Liebermann and al-Thani when he said on Israel Radio on Sunday that the two were at the \"height of their contacts\" in July.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Israel-Gaza crisis Israel-Gaza crisis \u2013 Palestinians in Gaza celebrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday, August 26.

It's a process. I think at this time, this is the right step.\"\n\nBennett denounced the transfer of millions to Gaza as \"protection money\" on Israel Radio.\n\n\"In the short term, you make the other side used to the fact that it can use violence to move its interests forward,\" he said.\n\nBennett has advocated a more hard-line approach toward Hamas, particularly since the start of weekly protests along the fence that separates Gaza and Israel. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by gunfire since March. One Israeli soldier has been killed and hundreds of fires have been set in Israel by flaming kites and balloons launched from the coastal enclave.\n\nPalestine Liberation Organization officials also slammed the transfer of money, while Palestinian Authority officials reached out to the Qatari government to express their opposition, saying it encouraged division between Palestinian factions.\n\nAhmad Majdalani, a PLO Executive Committee member, said: \"Qatari finance of Hamas is a smugglers' and mafia method. Since when does Israel care about Hamas?\"\n\nMajdalani accused the United States of orchestrating the payment, adding that Hamas was working to be a part of the Trump administration's peace proposal.

Firefighters on Sunday managed to contain flareups generated by high winds in Los Angeles County. But officials warned that the dry conditions feeding the fire are expected to continue into the week.\n\n\"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal,\" Gov.

It's destroyed an estimated 6,700 buildings, most of which were homes.\n\n\u2022 Woolsey and Hill fires: In Southern California, the Woolsey fire had spread to 85,500 acres and was 15% contained Sunday night, up from 5% the night before. The smaller Hill Fire covered 4,531 acres and was 75% contained. Together, responsible for the destruction of 179 structures, but another 57,000 are threatened, according to fire officials.\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: More than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide. The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nWinds, climate change provoking fires\n\nFirefighters made headway in containing the fires Saturday, but the return of powerful winds a day later threatened that progress, especially for the Woolsey fire. Officials warned gusts would peak at around 40 mph.\n\n\"Sadly, with these winds, it's not over yet,\" Scott Jalbert, chief of Cal Fire's San Luis Obispo Unit, said Sunday morning.\n\nCelebrities Neil Young, Robin Thicke and Gerard Butler were among those who lost their homes. Butler posted a photo on Twitter of the charred remains of a home and thanked firefighters for their courage. Thicke also posted a statement on Instagram thanking firefighters and volunteers who \"risked their lives trying to save our home.\"\n\nReturned to my house in Malibu after evacuating.

But that's no longer the case.\n\n\"And as evident by the Camp Fire in Northern California -- which is larger than this, more structures have been lost than this, more lives have been lost -- it's evident from that situation statewide that we're in climate change and it's going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Osby said.\n\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward .

Then it was a stately gesture to illustrate an alliance he's done little to cultivate. After a midterm election drubbing , it was an opportunity to retreat and regroup.\n\nYet by the time US President Donald Trump departed Orly Airport on Sunday, 44 hours after he arrived, the reasons for his trip to Paris had become largely obscured. It did less to bolster the transatlantic partnership than to expose its cracks . The 3,800 miles the President put between himself and Washington did little to buffer the boiling political crises back home\n\nAnd it was decidedly gloomier than the procession of tanks and troops Trump originally envisioned rolling through Washington on this date more than a year ago.\n\nOfficials scrambled to put something together and set a tentative date of November 11. But when estimates for Trump's military parade soared to nearly $100 million , officials realized they needed a backup plan to convince Trump a parade was too exorbitant. In the end, they persuaded him that dozens of other world leaders would be in Paris for the commemoration, and he needed to be, too.\n\nBut if Trump came to Paris expecting a parade that echoed the one he witnessed last summer, he was disappointed.

Homebound at the US ambassador's residence after foul weather forced the cancellation of a trip to an American burial ground, the President was invisible as his European counterparts memorialized the World War I slaughter across the former Western Front.\n\nThe White House declined to say how he spent the empty hours, though Trump tweeted in the evening he'd had \"some very productive meetings and calls for our country today.\"\n\nThe dire political predicament weighing on Trump cannot have been far from mind, despite the thousands of miles separating Paris and Washington.\n\nFresh off a midterm election that cost his party control of the House of Representatives, Trump kept an eye on his domestic difficulties while abroad. He accused election officials of rigging the vote in two US Senate races, repeated his claim that he does not personally know the man he tapped to become the acting attorney general and threatened to cut federal aid while blaming the deadly wildfires in California on \"poor\" forest management\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly visits the Aisne Marne American Cemetery near the Belleau Wood battleground, in Belleau, France, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)\n\nOfficially, the reason for scrapping the journey to the Aisne-Marne American cemetery came down to safety: the President's Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials and not the President. But there did not appear to be a backup plan and the President did not make any statements of regret at not being able to visit the cemetery.\n\nLate Sunday, the White House defended the President's decision not to attend, citing concerns about disrupting traffic.\n\n\"A car ride of two-and-a-half hours, each way, would have required closures to substantial portions of the Paris roadways for the President's motorcade, on short notice,\" said press secretary Sarah Sanders. \"President Trump did not want to cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people.\"\n\nThe optics were undeniably bad, partly because the episode only appeared to confirm the suspicions of Trump's critics that he is uninterested in carrying out the traditional duties of the commander in chief. While reasonable-sounding to those familiar with presidential travel logistics, the White House's explanations for the cancellation appeared inauthentic to casual observers.\n\nWhite House officials were confident early Sunday that those criticisms would evaporate after the President's appearance at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial, where more than 1,500 American soldiers are buried. His remarks, they said, would be the highlight of the trip. Trump addressed the crowd mutedly for roughly 10 minutes before leaving for the airport.\n\nIf the weather imbroglio was concerning him, it did not show.\n\n\"You look so comfortable up there under shelter as we're getting drenched,\" he called out to a group of American veterans. \"You're very smart people.\"\n\nNationalism in the crosshairs\n\nEarlier Sunday, as world leaders gathered under misting rain at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Trump opted to head directly to the Arc de Triomphe, where the ceremony was being held. Driving down a deserted Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a topless female protester breached the barricade lining the famous Parisian avenue and came within feet of the President's motorcade before she was apprehended by French security officials.\n\nThe dozens of other leaders who met at the French President's residence beforehand arrived in coach buses moments later, leaving Trump out of a striking scene as they marched down the street together with black umbrellas held over their heads, led by Macron. The White House said the President arrived separately because of \"security protocols.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and flashed Trump a thumbs up before taking his place on the riser.\n\nThe imagery may have been rooted in logistics, but as France and its European partners fret about the alliance forged with the United States in bloody conflict a century ago, it mattered. Trump has shown little appetite for strengthening the relationships that have underpinned transatlantic relations since the end of World War I, instead lambasting traditional US partners on trade and the cost of security.\n\nHe's shown more affinity for strongmen leaders who have eroded democracy in their countries, like Putin, with whom he spoke at a lunch on Sunday, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who sat alongside him at dinner on Saturday.\n\nThat's left leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Macron, who put forth well-publicized displays of unity this weekend, to urgently warn of backsliding into history's darkest moments.\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron warns of the perils of nationalism Replay More Videos ...

It's been fueled by Trump himself, who has proudly identified himself as a nationalist as he advances an \"America First\" agenda.\n\nIn his address, French President Emmanuel Macron -- who has emerged as Europe's most vocal sentry against a global tide of nationalism -- repeated his warnings.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" he said through a translator. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\n\"I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death,\" he said. \"History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"\n\nIt was impossible to view his remarks as anything less than a rebuke of Trump, who has proudly espoused an \"America First\" foreign policy. Speaking later at an American cemetery in Paris, Trump did not directly respond, choosing instead to stick to a brief speech honoring the war dead.\n\n\"Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior -- great, great warriors they are -- who gave everything for family, country, God and freedom,\" Trump said in the 10-minute speech, which was the centerpiece of his visit to Paris for the armistice centenary.\n\nTrump arrived separately from other foreign leaders to Sunday's armistice centenary ceremonies, which occurred under gray skies and cold drizzle. His counterparts, including Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, convened at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace before traveling together in motor coaches to the Arc de Triomphe. They walked in a large group to the event site under black umbrellas.\n\nInstead, Trump pulled up in his own vehicle and walked in separately, due to \"security protocols,\" according to the White House. A topless protester breached a police barricade and ran toward Trump's motorcade before being apprehended. Russian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and walked in solo, flashing Trump a brief thumbs-up as he took his place among the leaders.\n\nThe ceremony in Paris was the largest of events across Europe and in the United States commemorating the armistice . Queen Elizabeth II led members of the royal family -- including William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- at the Cenotaph in central London for a solemn ceremony.\n\nIn Washington, the role traditionally played by the President at Arlington National Cemetery was assumed this year by Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie who placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\nThe armistice that took effect at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 ended what was then the war meant to end all wars. When conflict broke out on the continent two decades later, the United States was again pulled into bloody battle, cementing its role in maintaining European security.\n\nVisiting Paris this week, Trump has bemoaned the cost to the US of helping maintain European security, insisting countries here do more to protect themselves. The cost of securing Europe is a reliable b\u00eate noire for Trump, one he's railed against on the campaign trail and in meetings with his counterparts.\n\nHis actions have raised questions about the state of longstanding US relationships.\n\nThe man who was once his top European partner, Macron, now appears to have become just another world leader subject to ill-timed insults and jabs. Trump's other counterparts -- British Prime Minister Theresa May and Germany's Merkel -- have also been subject to ridicule.\n\nTrump did not appear overly eager on Saturday to dispel the notion he is uninterested in bettering US-Europe ties. During a morning meeting with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored the two men's relationship were gone, replaced by wooden expressions of cooperation.\n\nLater, the President canceled a planned visit to an American cemetery 50 miles outside of Paris.

They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 44 homes and six other locations and found lead levels were at the legal limit. It wasn't enough to sound alarm bells.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Jury delivers $25.5 million 'statement' to Aetna to change its ways", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7keMng2BA8g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "FDA plans to launch new restrictions on e-cigarette flavors", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sautk1x1bCQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Taking on epidemic levels of teen e-cigarette use, the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce new restrictions on the sale of e-cigarette products an agency official confirmed Thursday.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as next week.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors share gun stories, demand action after NRA tells them to 'stay in their lane'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DpMBghpNdxY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

He is certainly among the richest.\n\nHe headed up the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico, which became the world's most powerful drug trafficking gang and dominated the heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine trade into the US.\n\nThe cartel made up to $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) a year and had influence in at least 50 countries.\n\nEl Chapo escaped twice from prison and was finally caught in 2016, then extradited to the US. He's also accused of being behind the killing of rivals and witnesses, so security in court will be extremely tight.\n\n2) Crunch time in Italy\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nItaly has struggled to agree its budget for months, and faces a deadline of Tuesday to do so.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis isn't just an issue that could affect Italy, but Europe and the world as well.\n\nItaly is governed by a coalition of populist far-right and far-left parties, who had made various spending promises during their campaigns.\n\nBut the country's debt is already worryingly high - equivalent to 131% of the country's GDP, the second-highest figure in the eurozone after Greece.\n\nEurope needs to approve Italy's budget - but the problem is Italy's eurosceptic government is proposing only to increase its debt, not manage it, and has hit back at what it sees as interference by Europe.\n\nIf Italy doesn't put forward a new budget by Tuesday, it faces a fine.\n\nThings could easily spiral from there - this is the third-biggest economy in the eurozone after all.

negotiation.\n\nAnd the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson - also a former Remainer - said there were many concerns with the paper and it must be made clear it was as far as the government would be willing to compromise.\n\nSeveral ministers on both sides of the argument are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU.\n\nMrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month.\n\nA Number 10 spokesman said: \"Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument.\"\n\nBut Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it appeared Mrs May had proceeded without the \"solid backing\" of her cabinet, having also declined to get Parliament's support for her negotiating objectives.\n\nIn his column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday, Boris Johnson called the prime minister's deal \"a recipe for continued strife, both in the Tory Party and the country\".\n\nAnd former cabinet minister John Whittingdale cast doubt on whether Mrs May could stay in office if Parliament rejected any deal she reached with the EU.\n\n\"I think if the PM's Brexit plan doesn't get through Parliament, I think it's quite difficult to see how the prime minister can continue

shortage of both EU and non-EU migrants reflects a falling interest in the UK as a destination for migrant workers.\n\nAnd it said research among over 1,000 employers suggested that vacancies are becoming harder to fill.\n\nThe squeeze is leading employers to increase pay rates, said the CIPD.\n\nWhile the short-term outlook for employment remains strong, labour and skills shortages are accelerating, says the institute.\n\nAccording to the latest official data, the number of non-UK-born workers in the UK decreased by 58,000 between April to June last year and the same period this year, with 40,000 of these non-EU-born workers.\n\nThis compares with an increase of 263,000 for the same period between 2016 and 2017.\n\n'Post-Brexit system'\n\n\"The data implies that the pendulum has swung away from the UK as an attractive place to live and work for non-UK-born citizens, especially non-EU citizens, during a period of strong employment growth and low unemployment,\" said Gerwyn Davies of the CIPD.\n\n\"This has heightened recruitment difficulties for some employers.\n\n\"It also underlines the risk that more non-UK-born citizens and employers will be discouraged from using the post-Brexit system if more support is not provided and it is not made simpler, fairer and more affordable; especially for lower-skilled roles.\n\n\"Against the backdrop of a tight labour market, failure to do this will heighten recruitment difficulties and could lead to negative consequences for existing staff, such as higher workloads, and loss of business or orders for firms.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the CIPD says that the UK labour supply looks set to be further constrained from 2021 when migration restrictions for EU citizens are introduced, especially for lower-skilled workers.\n\nIt says that employers express concern that the main route for recruiting EU citizens to fill lower-skilled roles that was recently proposed by the Migration Advisory Committee won't be enough to satisfy their recruitment needs.\n\nIn addition, a third of employers who employ non-EU citizens say that the administrative burden of using the current points-based system for non-EU citizens system, which

interventions.\n\nControlling blood pressure and cholesterol, having a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking can all help to stave off dementia, evidence suggests.\n\nDr Scott Chiesa, from UCL, said: \"Dementia is the end result of decades of damage, so by the time people get dementia it's too late to do anything.\n\n\"What we're trying to say is you need to get in as early as possible, identify a way to see who's actually progressing towards possibly getting dementia and target them.\"\n\nHowever, the study, co-funded by the British Heart Foundation, does not contain data on which study participants went on to develop dementia.\n\nResearchers next plan to use MRI scans to check if people in the study also display structural and functional changes within the brain that may explain their cognitive decline.\n\nThey also want to test whether the scan improves predictive risk scores for dementia which already exist.\n\nDr Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was not yet clear if the scan could improve the diagnosis of dementia.\n\nShe added: \"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important,

accused Defra and its ministers of telling \"barefaced lies\" about the effectiveness of one of its badger culls in England.\n\nThe group has written to the Chief Vet, Dr Christine Middlemas, asking her to ensure that the department retracts \"insupportable claims that its badger cull policy is working\".\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said all statements had been \"absolutely correct\".\n\nDr Iain McGill, a veterinary surgeon and director of Prion Interest Group, told BBC News that claims by Defra that the badger cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire were working were not supported by scientific evidence.\n\n\"According to Defra's figures, they claim that they calculated that the incidence [of TB in cattle] has reduced.\n\n\"But their calculations are unclear and deliberately opaque. And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence.\n\n\"So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up.\n\n\"Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter to Dr Middlemas goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustace of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nMr Eustace had said: \"Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.\"\n\nHowever, the APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, \"these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle\".\n\nWeight of science\n\nOn 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: \"The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.\"\n\nThe department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset.\n\nDr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.\n\n\"Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.\"\n\nIn response, a Defra statement said: \"The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.\n\n\"Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nDr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed.\n\nOn Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness \"lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation\".\n\nBut two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.\n\nJan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.\n\nShe said: \"Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers.\n\n\"Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.\"\n\nDefra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: \"This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.\"\n\nMedia access\n\nMuch of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey.\n\nDefra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.\n\nA spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFormer Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: \"When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nDefra responded: \"Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.\n\n\"As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "country_UK", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml", "title": "Universal credit: Rent arrears double for benefit claimants", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45893616", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:31", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Universal Credit experience: 'I've been left behind'\n\nCouncil tenants on universal credit have on average more than double the rent arrears of those still on housing benefit, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nIn Flintshire, north Wales, one of the first counties to test the new payment, the council says rent arrears have gone up by \u00a31m.\n\nOne claimant there said a mistake left him with just \u00a329 a month to live on.\n\nBut the UK government said it had listened to concerns and universal credit was working well.\n\nThe BBC contacted every local authority in the UK that has council homes about their arrears. The results from the 129 councils that responded showed the average amount owed by tenants claiming universal credit across the UK is \u00a3662.56. For those still on housing benefit it is \u00a3262.50\n\nFlintshire council said this week that tenants on universal credit in the county owe on average four times as much rent as those on the old benefits. At times it has been even higher; in September it was six times as much.\n\nIn the 18 months since universal credit was introduced in Flintshire, the council's rent arrears have increased by \u00a31m, something officials say is largely due to the new benefit.\n\nUniversal credit, which had cross-party support when it was first proposed, brings together six benefits, such as job seekers allowance, child tax credits and, crucially, housing benefit, into one payment.\n\nTo mirror being paid a salary, it is paid once a month - in arrears.\n\nWhile this has worked for some, other claimants have said it is this delay in the payment, combined with confusion over the online application process, that has seen families left with no income for weeks, forced to turn to food banks and choose between paying bills or paying their rent.\n\nUniversal credit was rolled out to job centres in Flintshire in April 2017, meaning the local authority is ahead of much of the UK. Eighteen months on, 23% of benefit claimants are now on universal credit in Flintshire, compared with about 10% nationally.\n\nCurrently one million people across the UK claim the new benefit, a figure that will eventually rise to eight million. Experts and council chiefs are expressing alarm.\n\nImage caption Single dad James McDaid was left with just \u00a330 a month after paying his rent\n\nSaved by the food bank\n\nOne person caught up in the universal credit confusion is single dad James McDaid.\n\nHe stopped work to look after his two-year-old son, and says he immediately ran into trouble when he made his first claim.\n\nHe received \u00a3579 a month, out of which he had to pay \u00a3550 in rent, and then buy food and pay other bills.\n\nUnable to find out why his payment was so low and forced to turn to the local food bank to have enough to eat, Mr McDaid said he had to wait for months while his claim was processed.\n\n\"If there weren't places like this [food bank] you'd be in trouble,\" he said. \"It's quite distressing, you panic about things.\n\n\"It's not fair to have that amount of stress. It's just mayhem because you just don't know if you're going to end up on the street or not.\"\n\n'I've found a bridge to live under'\n\nFor fellow universal credit claimant Anthony Smith, the prospect of living on the streets is even closer.\n\nAfter struggling to cope with the online application process, and being sanctioned for missing meetings, which he accepts made things worse, Mr Smith owed \u00a34,000 in rent when Panorama spoke to him.\n\n\"I can quite easily see myself being evicted,\" said Mr Smith, 63, who has worked all his adult life. \"I've even looked for somewhere to live and I've found a bridge where I can live.\n\n\"The only thing I'm not playing ball with is I can't use a computer. I'm left behind.\"\n\nNot long after he was interviewed, Mr Smith was told he would be evicted.\n\nImage caption Anita (C) says her family struggled because of Universal Credit\n\nSelling possessions to pay the bills\n\nPartners Anita Igbinoba and Richard Onwuemene had to rely on universal credit when a car accident prevented Mr Onwuemene from working. The couple said because of the way the benefit is calculated monthly, their first payment left them short and struggling with bills.\n\nMs Igbinoba said: \"That [\u00a353] was all we got. We couldn't pay council tax which we owed, we couldn't pay rent. Nobody listened to us, the bills were just going up and up and up. We couldn't get out of it.\n\n\"I'd sell things around the house just to make money to put in the electric for that week.\"\n\nUnable to manage finances\n\nUniversal credit is different because the amount for rent is paid straight to claimants, rather than direct to the landlord, like housing benefit.\n\nFor those who struggle to keep their finances in order - like Keith Barber who suffers from depression - it can lead to financial trouble.\n\nImage caption Keith Barber admits he is not good at budgeting\n\n\"There's a fair chance the council won't be getting it [the rent],\" said Mr Barber, 56, who lives in Deeside.\n\n\"I'm just terrible with money - I can't budget at all.\"\n\nKeith has missed appointments with the Job Centre and his local council. He now owes more than \u00a31,000 in rent and is also facing eviction.\n\nImage caption Neal Cockerton said Flintshire council was having to evict tenants who cannot keep up with their rent payments\n\nEvictions\n\nNeal Cockerton, head of housing at Flintshire council, is facing a double problem of tenants who cannot pay their rent and may have to be evicted, and a growing hole in the council's finances.\n\nIn 2017 the authority's rent arrears stood at \u00a31.6m. That figure is now more than \u00a32m.\n\nFlintshire council said this week that those on universal credit in the county owe an average of \u00a31,473 as opposed to tenants on the old benefits, who owe \u00a3334.\n\nMr Cockerton and his colleagues now increasingly have to take the difficult decision to evict tenants who cannot keep up with their rent payments. Evictions have increased by 55% compared to the same time last year.\n\n\"We do undertake a lot of intensive support before we get to that stage (eviction), but there is a degree of inevitability,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a bit of an ostrich situation that develops - you put your head in the sand and it will go away. It won't go away, the rent has to be paid.\"\n\nBecause universal credit is claimed online, the council has also had to employ four new staff to help with applications and arrears, another cost at a time when budgets are stretched.\n\nThe government has given them more funding to offset this, but the council said not only is it not enough, it is stopping in April 2019.\n\nImage caption Prof Paul Hickman said universal credit should probably be scrapped\n\n'I would scrap it'\n\nPanorama has also discovered that the government knew rent arrears caused by universal credit could be a problem.\n\nProf Paul Hickman of Sheffield Hallam University was asked by the UK government to look into the progress of the new benefit.\n\nHis study, in 2011, found only 8% of tenants who made seven or more rent payments managed to pay their rent in full.\n\nHe said the UK government had these figures but still went ahead with universal credit.\n\n\"Were we ignored?\" said Prof Hickman. \"Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling out universal credit so in some senses, whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead.\n\n\"I think realistically given the billions that have been spent in terms of implementing it, it's not going to happen... but I would probably scrap it.\"\n\nUniversal credit 'is working well'\n\nThe government has delayed migrating the majority of claimants over to universal credit for another year, as well as announcing more money for improvements to the system. Employment minister Alok Sharma said the new benefit is working, and claimed the rise in rent arrears is only temporary.\n\nHe said: \"Universal credit is working well. What we have is a system which is simpler, a system which people understand and ultimately makes sure they get into work faster and stay in work longer.\n\n\"After a period of time people will on average see those (rent) arrears coming down. But the key point here is to make sure that people get support in terms of funding, and that is why early this year we introduced a package worth one and a half billion pounds which means that anyone who's coming onto universal credit who is currently receiving housing benefit will get an extra two weeks of run-on - two weeks of extra money.\"\n\nWhen questioned about direct payments to claimants, the minister said: \"We have listened and made sure that it is possible for direct payments to be made to their landlord and that is actually happening across the country.\"\n\nWatch BBC Panorama's The Universal Credit Crisis on Monday at 19:30.

participants.\n\nResearchers hope it may offer a new way to predict cognitive decline.\n\nAn international team of experts, led by University College London (UCL), measured the intensity of the pulse travelling towards the brain in 3,191 people in 2002.\n\nA more intense pulse can cause damage to the small vessels of the brain, structural changes in the brain's blood vessel network and minor bleeds known as mini-strokes.\n\nOver the next 15 years, researchers monitored participants' memory and problem-solving ability.\n\nThose with the highest intensity pulse (the top quarter of participants) at the beginning of the study were about 50% more likely to show accelerated cognitive decline over the next decade compared with the rest of the participants, the study found.\n\nResearchers said this was the equivalent of about an extra one to one-and-half years of decline.\n\nCognitive decline is often one of the first signs of dementia, but not everyone who

may explain their cognitive decline.\n\nThey also want to test whether the scan improves predictive risk scores for dementia which already exist.\n\nDr Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was not yet clear if the scan could improve the diagnosis of dementia.\n\nShe added: \"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important,

Then when I got to university I began to faint frequently, my hair was falling out, I had severe joint pains and was constantly tired. My Mum thought it was down to my hectic student lifestyle.\"\n\nA visit to her GP and two blood tests for iron levels revealed that she was suffering from genetic haemochromatosis or GH - a genetic condition which causes iron to overload in the body.\n\nMost of us think of iron as a strength-giver and worry more about iron deficiency. There is little awareness of the risks of iron overload, and confusingly some of the symptoms, like fatigue, can be the same.\n\nSays Katherine: \"I was very lucky to get a quick diagnosis. A lot of health professionals believe women do not show symptoms until much later in life, which can then lead to potential organ damage.\n\n\"In the last year, I have had about 30 hospital and health visits. Today I suffer from chronic fatigue, IBS, and joint pains in my knees, hands and elbows. The only treatment for this is venesection, where I have a pint of blood removed every few months.\n\n\"I do feel lucky that I was diagnosed young as it allows me to monitor my health. Some days I am in excruciating pain, other days I am fine. But there needs to be more awareness of this condition.\"\n\nWhat is genetic haemochromatosis?\n\nGH is a condition which leads to the accumulation of iron in the organs of the body\n\nIn the UK, it is thought that approximately 250,000 people are at risk of GH, although many are undiagnosed, and the risk is higher for men than women\n\nIt is caused by a faulty gene - Northern Europeans with Celtic origins, particularly of Irish backgrounds, are more likely to carry the gene\n\nSymptoms of GH include fatigue, joint disease, skin problems, and sexual health issues. Left untreated GH can cause serious illness such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.\n\nTreatment is relatively simple and consists of venesection (bloodletting). As the body makes more blood to replace that taken, it uses up the excess stored iron.\n\nSource: Haemochromatosis UK\n\n'The most common condition you've never heard of'\n\nA recent report by the charity Haemochromatosis UK (HUK) surveyed 2,000 people with the condition worldwide.\n\nIt found that 73% of patients suffered with psychological difficulties, 81% experienced fatigue and 87% experienced arthritis or joint pain.\n\nAlthough most were satisfied with their treatment by specialists, about a third highlighted that information and support from GPs was poor.\n\nThe report was launched at the House of Commons, where MPs, campaigners and patients gathered to help raise awareness of the condition.\n\nDr Edward Fitzsimons, consultant haematologist, University of Glasgow, said: \"Haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders found in North European populations.\n\n\"Yet it is a condition that all too easily escapes diagnosis.\n\n\"For every one patient diagnosed, there are some eight to 10 who are undiagnosed.\n\n\"It is without doubt the most common condition you have never heard of.\"\n\n'I felt like an old aching lady instead of a young teen'\n\nImage copyright Abigail Harvey Image caption Abigail Harvey, 19, is having treatment for haemochromatosis\n\nAbigail Harvey, 19, was diagnosed with haemochromatosis at just 15.\n\nUp to that point she had suffered from severe period pain cramps and joint pain as well as depression.

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing.

They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter.\"\n\nThe letter to Dr Middlemas goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustace of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).\n\nMr Eustace had said: \"Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.\"\n\nHowever, the APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, \"these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle\".\n\nWeight of science\n\nOn 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: \"The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.\"\n\nThe department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset.\n\nDr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.\n\n\"Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,\" he told BBC News. \"The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.\"\n\nIn response, a Defra statement said: \"The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.\n\n\"Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.\"\n\nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nDr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed.\n\nOn Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness \"lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation\".\n\nBut two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.\n\nJan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.\n\nShe said: \"Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers.\n\n\"Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.\"\n\nDefra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: \"This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.\"\n\nMedia access\n\nMuch of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey.\n\nDefra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.\n\nA spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFormer Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: \"When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth.\n\n\"I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.\"\n\nDefra responded: \"Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.\n\n\"As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "The 'painted wolves' of Zimbabwe", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46141876", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Staring competition: Painted wolves, or African wild dogs, do everything as a group - even facing up to a hyena\n\nThey are stunning; there's no question.

Lots of movement and lots of noise.\n\n\"They have several calls, but perhaps the most endearing sound they make is the hoo call,\" explains Nick.\n\n\"If they get separated from the pack, they put their head low and make this 'hoo, hoo' noise, which is an incredibly haunting sound, but that sound can travel up to 2km and with their big ears they can pick it up, and that reunites the pack.\"\n\nWhisper it quietly, they're also just a bit smelly.

More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

A senior official of Hamas, the group administering the Gaza Strip, said the Israeli special forces team infiltrated an area near the southern city of Khan Younis in a civilian vehicle.\n\nAmong those reported killed in the attack was Nour Baraka, a prominent commander of the al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas.\n\nA ground operation inside the Gaza Strip is rare and it is likely to up tensions significantly.\n\n\"We heard that a special Israeli unit went inside Khan Younis and assassinated Nour Baraka and another [commander],\" Ghazi Hamad, senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"After [that], the car which carried this special unit or some collaborators, they tried to escape \u2026 but they were followed by Hamas and the al-Qassam Brigades and after that Israel tried to cover this car through striking here in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nWitnesses said during the chase Israeli aircraft fired more than 40 missiles in the area where the incident took place, killing at least four other people.\n\nFawzi Barhoum, a spokesperson for Hamas, denounced what he called a \"cowardly Israeli attack\".\n\nExchange of fire\n\nAn Israeli soldier was killed in an exchange of fire during the operation, the army said, as tensions rose with the Hamas-run Palestinian enclave.\n\n\"During an [Israeli] special forces operational activity in the Gaza Strip, an exchange of fire evolved,\" the army said in a statement.\n\n\"At this incident, an IDF officer was killed and an additional officer was moderately injured,\" it added, referring to the Israeli army.\n\nThe army said its soldiers had returned.\n\nAfter the clash erupted, sirens were reported in southern Israel indicating rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.\n\nTen launches from Gaza towards Israel were identified and two were intercepted by Israeli missile defences, the army said. It was not immediately clear where the others landed.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on an official visit to France, announced he was rushing back to Israel to deal with the crisis.\n\nSensitive timing\n\nAl Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from Jerusalem\n\nThe Israeli covert special forces team crossed three kilometers inside Gaza territory from the border fence, travelling in a civilian vehicle. There, they shot dead 37-year-old Nour Baraka, a senior commander of Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades, the group's military wing.\n\nSix other Palestinians were then killed in what became a chase in which the Israelis were withdrawing under the support of heavy air strikes. Israel's military says it intercepted three out of 17 rockets fired from Gaza after the raid.\n\nThis escaltion comes at a very sensitive time when there had been some progress in efforts to reach a long-term truce between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Egypt, the United Nations and involving Qatari funding.\n\nIt also came at a time when Netanyahu was in Paris talking about his self-proclaimed commitment to create a more stable situation in Gaza. In Israel itself, Netanyahu has been facing political backlash for appearing to be too soft on Hamas.\n\nA return by Israel to a policy of targeting individual Hamas commanders - tactics largely abandoned in recent years - could significantly raise tensions along the border.\n\nIsrael and Palestinian fighters in Gaza have fought three wars since 2008, and recent months of unrest have raised fears of a fourth.\n\nCrippling blockade\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nViolence has flared frequently on the frontier since Palestinians began weekly protests on March 30.\n\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip have demonstrated along the fence with Israel demanding their right to return to the homes and land their families were expelled from 70 years ago.\n\nThey are also demanding an end to Israel's crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has gutted the coastal enclave's economy and deprived its two million inhabitants of many basic commodities.\n\nSince the Great March of Return demonstrations began on March 30, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and thousands more wounded by Israeli troops deployed along the other side of the fence.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United Nations have been trying to broker a long-term ceasefire.\n\nMouin Rabbani, a senior fellow at the Institute for Palestine Studies, told Al Jazeera it is clear Sunday's covert operation was \"a premeditated assassination\".\n\n\"The question that arises is what Israel's motivations were? Were they, as so often in the past, trying to give Hamas a bloody nose just to remind them that they're in charge and that they will decide the terms of which any ceasefire is reached?\n\n\"Are they perhaps by contrast trying to scuttle this ceasefire initiative and perhaps engage in a larger conflict as happened in 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2014?\" Rabbani said.\n\n\"My sense is that Israel at this stage is probably more interested in giving Hamas a bloody nose and trying to remind people who is boss and it will be Israel that decides the extent to which the illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip is maintained.\"\n\nQatari cash\n\nOn Friday, Palestinian civil servants began receiving payments after months of sporadic salary disbursements in cash-strapped Gaza, with $15m delivered into the enclave through Israel in suitcases by Qatar.\n\nHamas responded by lowering the intensity of Friday's border protest.\n\nA total of $90m will be distributed in six monthly instalments, Gaza authorities said, primarily to cover salaries of officials working for Hamas.\n\nQatar has also said it would hand out $100 to each of 50,000 poor families, as well as larger sums to Palestinians wounded in clashes along the Gaza-Israel border.\n\nThe Gulf emirate has also started buying additional fuel for Gaza's sole power station, allowing outages to be reduced to their lowest level in years.\n\nThe payments are part of what is expected to be a set of informal understandings between Israel and Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu earlier on Sunday defended his decision to allow Qatar to transfer the cash to Gaza despite criticism from within his own government over the move, saying he wanted to avoid a war if it wasn't necessary.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas angrily accused Israel and the United States of ganging up behind his back to entrench Hamas' control over Gaza.\n\nHe also accused Hamas of undermining his goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nTrump's peace plan\n\nAl Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington\n\nJust a week ago, Trump's representative Jason Greenblatt held a meeting with Netanyahu in Israel where the issue of Gaza was discussed. The outcome of that meeting as it was communicated was that the US was very keen to see stability returning to Gaza.\n\nThis calm was supposed to be prelude to introducing Trump's initiative for a resuscitation of the long-dormant peace process. Trump said in September that he would bring forward his plan within two to four months, which brings it to the beginning of December.\n\nLast week, Greenblatt said that the plan is ready for presentation within days or possibly weeks.\n\nThe violence in Gaza seems to be an obstacle but Trump seems ready to push forward with the plan despite one of the major parties, the Palestinians, having nothing to do with it. The Palestinians no longer see the US as an independent impartial arbiter. They believe that the initiative's goal above all else is to guarantee the security of Israel."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Gaza: Aftermath of Israel's clandestine operation", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/gaza-aftermath-israel-clandestine-operation-181112075724400.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Sunday in air strikes and an undercover raid that Hamas, which governs the besieged enclave, said targeted one of its commanders.\n\nMedics and Hamas officials said at least seven people were killed, including Hamas commander Nour Baraka.\n\nThe attack prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short a visit to Paris, where he had been gathering with world leaders for a World War One commemoration.\n\nAccording to witnesses, Israeli aircraft fired more than 40 missiles in the area.\n\nIsraeli military said one of its officers died during the covert operation that is likely to boost tensions.\n\nSince 2008, Israel has launched three major assaults on Gaza that have heavily damaged the Strip's infrastructure and sources of livelihood.\n\nThe enclave with nearly 2 million people has been under an air, and sea blocakde imposed by Israel since 2007."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Why does the language of journalism fail indigenous people?", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/americas/2018/11/language-journalism-fail-indigenous-people-181111095120969.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "I really want to do this story justice.\n\nIt is a mantra I adhered to long before I became a journalist; my parents travelled great distances to build a life together and I've always wanted to pull my weight in that happy ending.\n\nIt is also the mantra I carried with me this summer as I left my home in Qatar for the 10,000km journey to Alaska, as I boarded the nine-seater plane at the tiny air taxi office in Anchorage and as we flew over a snowy mountain range and rolling tundra.\n\nI was returning to Iliamna, my mother's remote Alaskan village, which lies on the waters of the largest sockeye salmon run in the world. My mother is an Alaska Native - a member of the Dena'ina ethnic-language group.\n\nMy father is a Qatari. Every summer, my parents, sister and I would return to Iliamna to visit family and help with the salmon run - assisting with catching, smoking, brining and canning the salmon that is so central to the community's subsistence lifestyle.\n\nI was working on a film about the pressures facing this community - a community I feel both a part of and removed from. Despite knowing many people there since childhood, I was worried that people wouldn't want to talk on camera. I knew I would feel apologetic and hurt if they didn't, despite trying to reason with myself. For me it wasn't about securing or losing an interview; it was about confirming or rejecting that I had a place in the story.\n\nTelling a personal story can be scary because you are admitting that you don't know everything about your own language, culture and family. You have to ask hard questions. Were you ignorant about something because you didn't care enough to learn it? Were you too embarrassed to ask? Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between apathy and shame; you are either motionless from lack of care or paralysed by too much of it.\n\nDespite knowing many people there since childhood, I was worried that people wouldn't want to talk on camera ... For me it wasn't about securing or losing an interview; it was about confirming or rejecting that I had a place in the story. Amira Abujbara, journalist\n\nDespite months of planning and phone calls back and forth, it was only as we sat down for our first interview - with an elder in his house on a small cliff overlooking Lake Iliamna - that I truly believed the film was going to happen and that people would actually talk to us.\n\nThe interview began as most would in the coming days: quietly. His wife fidgeted nervously outside the camera frame. I assumed a casual slouch on the sofa, more to calm my own nerves than his. He was a distant relative and our paths hadn't crossed before because we both lived outside the village.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nLike most people in the community, he was a good storyteller and his cadence gave the world rhythm. He offered me another thread that tied me to this place and I marvelled. Then the door burst open - a team of neighbours had come to mow his lawn - our interview would have to resume another day.\n\nThere were logistical challenges to filming in Iliamna; time works differently in a community where the sun sets at midnight and daily activities are dictated by the weather.\n\nIt is hard to track down interviews somewhere where there are few roads and people can be anywhere from \"over the road\" to \"somewhere upriver\". We were also visiting during the busiest time of the year when residents are balancing jobs with the labour-intensive process of catching and storing salmon for the year.\n\nOn a personal level, I was worried that I would get it wrong; that I would ask the wrong questions, at the wrong time or in the wrong way. I feel this way about any story I work on - I think being self-critical is essential for any journalist - but when you are of mixed heritage you feel indebted to a community for giving all of itself to you when you feel like you only ever give half of yourself to it.\n\nSo when an opportunity like this one comes along, you want to do everything possible to get it right.\n\n'Media has rarely served Native communities well'\n\nI assume most TV crews that pass through the Iliamna Lake area shoot nature documentaries or focus on the controversial Pebble mining deposit nearby - or are trying to track down the mythological Iliamna Lake Monster. So, I really wanted this story to be about the community and for the community.\n\nWith this came the added pressure of history. Media has rarely served Native communities well, and this has fostered a distrust towards journalists.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nThis distrust wasn't overt in Iliamna - I think that was partly because of my family's connection to the community but also because it serves as a regional hub and is in relatively close proximity - a 50-minute flight - to the city of Anchorage.\n\nThere were some exceptions; one family friend yelled me and the rest of the crew out of his workshop before we could open our mouths. He later told me that there were no hard feelings but that TV crews always twisted words. I couldn't disagree.\n\nI suspect distrust is even greater in those indigenous communities that subsist off of marine mammals. They were deeply impacted by animal welfare campaigns attacking whaling and seal hunting in the 1970s and the cultural and economic devastation of those campaigns - from food shortages to sky-high suicide rates - still run deep.\n\nI had previously reached out to a Native organisation in the Bering Strait region, which is located in northwest Alaska and largely made up of whaling and seal-hunting communities, and was met with defensive anger.\n\nThe representative questioned my background, my company and my motives. After some discussion, she explained that they wanted to keep their way of life to themselves because people so often misunderstand it.\n\nShe was gracious, considering what she knew was at stake; Native people have long been misrepresented and penalised for a way of life that is portrayed as primaeval, cruel or embarrassing - rather than as something deeply felt and timeless in its adaptability.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nShe reminded me of an incident last year in which a 16-year-old boy from Gambell, a small Siberian Yup'ik community located on St Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, faced online hate - including death threats - after striking a whale to help feed his community.\n\nThe hundreds of messages he received came after a prominent environmental activist shared an article about him in a disparaging social media post.\n\nI think the issue is a fundamental one. Journalists have rarely done justice to indigenous communities because the language of journalism has rarely done justice to indigenous peoples.\n\nIndigenous people know that their representation has failed before they've even begun speaking, because the medium through which they are represented - a hard, sharp language rooted in ideas rather than feeling - has rarely granted them territory.\n\nJournalists have rarely done justice to indigenous communities because the language of journalism has rarely done justice to indigenous peoples. Amira Abujbara, journalist\n\nThe language that media uses today does not heed silence and self-interpretation. It does not respect the power of conjured stories. It does not favour the collective over the individual. And this does not fit with indigenous perspectives.\n\nBut we have much to learn from those perspectives. In my experience, Native culture does not flinch. It does not try to separate itself from its surroundings because that makes no sense when you rely on your surroundings to support your family and feel like yourself.\n\nIt is rooted in an attitude that says \"this is the way it is\", not \"this is what I need it to be\". It has the ability to innovate out of necessity, not greed. It offers a different kind of normal and we as consumers, creators and polluters are in dire need of a new normal.\n\nStraddling two worlds\n\nThis was my first film project, and collaborating with director Ciara Lacy and her team was exciting for me because suddenly we could speak with sound and images.\n\nIn writing, tone can be a blind spot; how a person says or feels something isn't always self-evident in a direct quote, and you often have to work at making it feel right by drawing out the silent spaces of a conversation. But with film, you can say nothing and a scene will speak for itself. It is so powerful.\n\nI found comfort and solidarity working with Ciara and composer Kayla Briet, who are also mixed-heritage indigenous women. Their work teaches me more about celebrating the roots I have, no matter how big or small, and owning them as part of my identity.\n\n\n\nI wonder if it is being of mixed heritage that makes me feel more connected to my Alaskan community, because the perspectives of indigenous people today are inevitably those of mixed heritages; after colonisation we were all straddling two worlds, all putting effort into learning our own cultures and languages - and often feeling guilty about it.\n\nBut I think this is where we find a lot of strength - and where everyone can find strength. When we move between worlds, we are positioned to tell new stories. And when we tell new stories, we invent new ways of telling them.\n\nFinding a new language can be a difficult and unsupported task, but it means we can then approach stories with the nuance of our lived experiences. And out of that, we find new truth."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Survivor stories from Super Typhoon Haiyan", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2018/11/tanauan-stronger-storm-181108101421851.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "MUST-SEE PROGRAMMES\n\nFault Lines Church of Trump An insight into the Trump administration's relationship with the religious right and implications for US politics."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Jamal Khashoggi case: All the latest updates", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-case-latest-updates-181010133542286.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Saudi Arabia has admitted Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in the Turkish city of Istanbul.\n\nKhashoggi - a Saudi writer, US resident and Washington Post columnist - entered the building on October 2 to obtain documentation certifying he had divorced his ex-wife so he could remarry.\n\nAfter weeks of repeated denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance, the kingdom eventually acknowledged that the murder was premeditated.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:12", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Navy Warplane Down in 2nd Crash From US Carrier in Month", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/navy-warplane-down-in-2nd-crash-from-us-carrier-in-month/4654519.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:18", "body_paragraphs": "A warplane from the aircraft career USS Ronald Reagan crashed into the sea northeast of the Philippines on Monday, but its two aviators were rescued safely.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the F/A-18 Hornet had a mechanical problem during Monday's routine operations in the Philippine Sea.\n\nA rescue aircraft plucked the aviators from the water immediately and brought them back to the ship, the Navy's statement said.

I think it's a natural progression that you'll see more of us, you know, running for office.\"\n\nTwo female veterans' races are still undecided \u2014 one in Arizona and another in Texas \u2014 but of the six female veterans guaranteed to serve in the next Congress, only one \u2014 Iowa Senator Joni Ernst \u2014 is a Republican.\n\nPolitical scientist Molly O'Rourke of American University in Washington said this matches an overarching political trend.\n\n\"Gender and partisanship have a very interesting relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so women are more likely to identify themselves as Democrats and align themselves with democratic priorities, Democratic candidates, but increasingly, you see that divide growing as well.\"\n\nMany analysts have tied the increase in women seeking office to a strong disapproval of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"That's been the basis for a lot of this activism and motivation to engage in politics, but it's also really become larger than Donald Trump,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIt's not just a reaction to President Trump, but it's now about really changing the focus of our elected leadership in this country.\"\n\nRemembering McCain\n\nFor years, elected leaders on both sides of the aisle have pushed through laws with little to no bipartisan support. Luria, a Democrat, often referenced the principles of a Republican on the campaign trail \u2014 the late Senator John McCain, who died in August.\n\n\"You could see the admiration on both sides of the aisle for his service to our country in the military, as a prisoner of war, in the Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think people are looking more for that type of leadership of people willing to put country above party and do what's right.\"\n\nLuria said that as she meets with fellow members of Congress in the coming days, she\u2019ll start working on things that are important to all sides \u2014 things like infrastructure and the military \u2014 to deliver results in a divided Congress, rather than gridlock."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Florida Declares Recount for Governor's and US Senate Races", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-will-recount-votes/4653180.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "The Democratic candidate for governor in the state of Florida has rescinded the concession he made Tuesday night after the Florida secretary of state announced the governor's race, as well as the race for a seat in the U.S. Senate, will be subject to a recount.\n\nAndrew Gillum spoke to media Saturday shortly after the recount announcement. He said, \"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote.

Florida state law requires a statewide machine recount when the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent, and a manual recount if the margin is less than 0.25 percent.\n\nThe governor's race between Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, and Ron DeSantis, a Republican former congressman, showed DeSantis leading by 33,684 votes, or about 0.4 percent.\n\nThe contentious U.S. Senate race between Republican Governor Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson had Scott ahead by just 15,562 votes, a lead of 0.15 percent.\n\n\u200bUnofficial vote counts from county canvassing boards were submitted by a midday Saturday deadline, enabling the Florida secretary of state and the Division of Elections to determine that the returns met the legal thresholds requiring recounts.\n\nThe uncertainty over the outcome of the races has deepened divisions in a state that is likely to play a key role in the 2020 presidential election. The recounts will determine if Nelson returns to Capitol Hill or if Republicans increase their lead in the Senate.\n\nThe fight for Nelson's seat has been particularly acrimonious, with both sides filing lawsuits. Scott, President Donald Trump and other Republicans have accused Nelson of trying to steal the election, while Nelson has alleged Scott is trying to stop officials from counting every ballot. Trump called the situation \"a disgrace.\"\n\nScott had asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the election departments in South Florida's Democratic-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties after his lead narrowed as ballots continued to be counted throughout the week. A state election spokeswoman said Friday, however, an investigation would not be launched because there was no evidence of fraud.\n\nJudges ruled in favor of Scott late Friday, ordering election supervisors in the two counties to release information on the ballot-counting."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Potions of Yore Preserved in Small US Museum", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/alexandria-virginia-apothecary-museum/4653553.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "The wizards in the world of Harry Potter made regular use of dragon's blood, mandrake root and devil's snare for potions and spells. In the real world, healers and midwives also used creepy-named plants for medicinal purposes, and they didn't need to visit Hogwarts to get them. They could be purchased at an ordinary apothecary (a pharmacy or drugstore).\n\nToday, one of the best preserved apothecaries in the United States has been turned into a museum in historic Alexandria, Virginia, and provides a fascinating glimpse of medicines before the days of antibiotics and modern drugs.\n\nFor more than 140 years, from 1792 to 1933, the family-owned Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary served customers with an amazing assortment of medicines. When the shop closed down, the new owner kept it just the way it was and turned it into a museum.\n\nThe apothecary usually provided remedies \"for minor ailments, rashes, the flu, or a headache,\" explained Lauren Gleason, manager of the museum.\n\nCurator Callie Stapp oversees the intriguing collection of thousands of objects, most in excellent condition. They include weighing scales, weird bloodletting tools, and cobalt glass bottles that stored poisonous liquids.\n\n\"The apothecary is so much the same that if the owners were still alive today they would feel at home in it,\" she said.\n\nFamous patrons\n\n\n\nThe shop serviced famous clients, including President George Washington and his wife Martha, who had items delivered to their nearby Mount Vernon estate. The museum even has a note written by Mrs. Washington, requesting the delivery of castor oil, which was used as a laxative.\n\n\n\nLike a modern drugstore, the apothecary sold more than medicine.\n\n\"Lots of other chemicals like paints, dyes and perfumes, would have been made and sold here,\" said Gleason. But \"other items like sewing machines, pens, razors and baby bottles were sold here as well.\"\n\nThe store's original gleaming white shelves hold dozens of clear hand-blown glass bottles for liquids, labeled in gold leaf.\n\n\"These bottles have probably been part of this pharmacy's collection since the 1850s,\" Gleason explained. \"The various concoctions helped with things like coughing, an upset stomach and kidney disease.\"\n\nRemnants of the past\n\n\n\nA number of the bottles have traces of residue from the ingredients. Others, amazingly, still contain liquids that go back decades, including cinnamon for nausea, iodine, an antiseptic, and opium, which is derived from the poppy flower.\n\n\"Opium was a very effective pain killer, and it would often be used to treat the flu or dysentery,\" Gleason said. \"And it would have even been used to treat depression, though we know today it would not have been helpful.\"\n\nA dimly-lit upstairs room looks like something out of a Harry Potter movie, with its old wooden boxes and drawers for storing herbs and other botanicals.\n\nDragon's Blood is hand-written on one of the drawers. It supposedly comes from dragons and is used to make potions in the wizardly world. But Dragon's Blood actually comes from a tree whose red resin was mostly used as varnish.\n\nStraight out of Harry Potter\n\n\n\nA container marked aconite, once held a topical pain reliever that is poisonous to eat. But in the Potter series, the plant, also called wolfsbane, helps control violence by werewolves during their full moon transformations.\n\n\n\n\"So if you're having werewolf trouble, it will get you through to the next full moon,\" remarked tour guide Jim Williams with a smile. \"But the practical use was for gout and joint pain.\"\n\nDried wild carrot tops were once used as an anti-inflammatory. Stapp carefully opens a sticky drawer that is stuffed with them. \"They look surprisingly the same way as when they were packaged many years ago,\" she said.\n\nWhat's old is new again\n\n\n\nVisitor Christine Zapata from California said she was intrigued by the variety of plants, including cannabis, the marijuana plant.\n\n\"Herbs and plant-based medicine are coming back now, so it was most interesting for me since I work in the cannabis industry.\"\n\nWilliams pointed out a timeworn box that used to contain bottles of Coca-Cola. The original drink was first marketed in the late 1800's, not as a beverage, but as medicine that could cure a number of ailments. The problem was it could also be addictive.\n\n\"On the box it says 'for exhaustion and headache.' That's when coke still had the cocaine in it,\" he noted.\n\nWhile some medicines were discarded after it was known they were toxic, we still rely on others found in the apothecary for today's modern remedies."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Potions of Yore Preserved in Small US Museum", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/apothecary-museum/4654010.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "Dragon's blood, mandrake root and devil's snare were used for potions and spells in the Harry Potter series.

That term, ecologically valid, means that the research attempts to mimic real life.\n\nThe study divided the participants into two groups: The first group was allowed to maintain their normal social media habits. The other, the control group, was restricted to 10 minutes per day on each of the three platforms: Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe restrictions were put in place for three weeks and then the participants returned and were tested for outcomes such as fear of missing out (FOMO), anxiety, depression and loneliness.\n\n\u200bResults of study\n\nThe results showed a very clear link between social media use and increased levels of depression and loneliness.\n\n\u201cUsing less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese effects are particularly pronounced for folks who were more depressed when they came into the study.\u201d\n\nShe calls her findings the \u201cgrand irony\u201d of social media.\n\nWhat is it about social media that\u2019s just so depressing?\n\nHunt says that it\u2019s two major things. The first is that social media invites what Hunt calls \u201cdownward social comparison.\u201d When you\u2019re online, it can sometimes seem that \u201ceveryone else is cooler and having more fun and included in more things and you\u2019re left out,\u201d she said. And that\u2019s just generally demoralizing.\n\nThe second factor is a bit more nuanced.\n\n\u201cTime is a zero-sum game,\u201d Hunt told VOA. \u201cEvery minute you spend online is a minute you are not doing your work or not meeting a friend for dinner or having a deep conversation with your roommate.\u201d\n\nAnd these real life activities are the ones that can bolster self-esteem and self worth, Hunt said.\n\nWhat to learn\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway?\n\nPeople are on their devices, and that\u2019s not going to change, she said. But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said. But she expects her results should generalize at least for people through the age of 30.\n\nHunt says she is now beginning a study to gauge the emotional impact of dating apps."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "For Autistic Kids, Robots Can Be Social, Learning Study Buddy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/for-autistic-kids-robots-can-be-social-skills-learning-study-buddy/4652742.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "Robots have been put to work assembling cars in factories, answering questions at conventions and hotel lobbies, moving packages in warehouses, and more.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

Here's How To Challenge It.", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-matthew-whitaker-attorney-general_us_5be891e4e4b0dbe871ac6599", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "Perhaps the most alarming \u2015 if not exactly surprising \u2015 fallout from last Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections was President Donald Trump\u2019s immediate dismissal of his long-beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and the subsequent appointment of Matthew Whitaker, a Trump toady and Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, as his acting replacement. If the firing was, in part, an attempt to commandeer the nation\u2019s post-election attention, it worked.\n\nMuch has been said and written already about the one-two punch of Sessions\u2019 firing and his immediate replacement by a plainly unqualified staffer who had been secretly (or, as it turns out, not so secretly) spying on the attorney general on behalf of the White House. But some of what\u2019s been said is wrong, and the parts that are right will no doubt need bolstering against inevitable withering attack, so a bit more still needs to be said.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Trump fired Sessions for doing the one unquestionably ethical and decent thing in his tenure as attorney general \u2015 recusing himself from the investigation of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, including contacts with Russia, of which he was an integral part. Although the nation is still waiting for many of the shoes from that investigation to drop, we have already seen, in 18 months, a remarkable 35 indictments, six guilty pleas, and eight jury convictions. Whitaker, who has been critical of the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, now oversees that investigation, as well as the FBI and all 93 U.S. attorneys. And he may do so until next June.\n\nTrump has been told repeatedly, by members of his own party, that sacking Sessions and otherwise threatening Mueller could cost him his presidency. Yet he has done just that.\n\nOver months of using cable television appearances to audition for the role, Whitaker has nurtured the president\u2019s expectation that he can and will refuse to recuse himself from oversight of Mueller\u2019s investigation, and will indeed shield Trump and his family from any consequences of that investigation, including being held accountable for legal violations that carry the risk of serious jail time and removal from office. One can imagine no reason for Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker other than the hope of such illegitimate protection.\n\nSo the key question is whether, as most legal scholars appear to agree, Whitaker\u2019s installation is indeed unlawful \u2015 and, if it is, whether the illegality is so clear and significant that no court could credibly hold otherwise.\n\nJIM WATSON via Getty Images\n\nWhether Whitaker\u2019s appointment is legal isn\u2019t just an academic question \u2015 there are real-world scenarios that will force a court to find that it is not. As things stand, individuals charged with federal crimes by Whitaker\u2019s Justice Department could move to dismiss charges against them. If the attorney general \u2015 whose signature appears on the charging documents \u2015 is effectively an impostor, then the office has no legal authority. And the Supreme Court has a history of setting aside official actions that flow from invalid appointments.\n\nSo, if a defendant can show that Whitaker\u2019s authorization is behind a case, and that there\u2019s a serious question about whether Whitaker was legally appointed, courts will have a hard time allowing that case to go forward. Criminal defendants in federal prosecutions could resist whatever the Justice Department demands of them (for instance, by subpoena) by arguing that Whitaker is a legal nobody. Ironically, the only defendant who would find it impossible to use that argument is the man who appointed Whitaker, Donald J. Trump \u2015 in the event he were to be subpoenaed or indicted pursuant to Whitaker\u2019s approval.\n\nIn addition, individual senators could argue that Whitaker\u2019s appointment robs the institutional power conferred on them by the Constitution. The Appointments Clause of Article II charges the Senate with providing \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on the appointment of certain officers, including the attorney general. But Whitaker\u2019s appointment bypassed Senate confirmation, effectively nullifying the power of the Senate and its members to offer advice and consent. Senators could therefore affirmatively sue over the loss of this essential power.\n\nWhen courts do consider the merits of Whitaker\u2019s appointment, they\u2019ll find that it stands on shaky legal ground.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and others did exactly that when they sued Trump, so far successfully, for accepting foreign government money without congressional permission, which is required by the Constitution\u2019s Foreign Emoluments Clause. It helps that, in that case, the court pointedly noted that the advice and consent provision of Article II is the only constitutional provision similar to the Emoluments Clause\u2019s congressional-consent requirement.\n\nOpponents might point out that if legislators are unhappy, they have a more appropriate available remedy than a court challenge \u2015 they can pass a law. This objection, which the court in the emoluments case called \u201cirrelevant,\u201d is especially inapposite here, because the Senate already did pass a law, the Attorney General Succession Act.\n\nThat statute created a line of succession for the position of attorney general, which would require the position to be filled in this case by the sitting deputy, Rod Rosenstein. It\u2019s hard to imagine what legislative action could be clearer, unless the Senate is expected to pass the law again, now with the added words \u201cand this time we really mean it.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, Mueller or Rosenstein could invoke the illegality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment to justify refusing to follow an order from him. Any of these paths will prompt the judicial branch to exercise the reviewing role it\u2019s held since Marbury v. Madison \u2013 even if, as we have learned, Whitaker may not recognize the legitimacy of that role.\n\nWhen courts do consider the merits of Whitaker\u2019s appointment, they\u2019ll find that it stands on shaky legal ground.\n\nFirst, although Trump may not have uttered to Sessions the words that made him famous on TV (\u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d), it\u2019s clear that he did, in fact, fire Sessions. While the attorney general may not have departed under literal threat, he was left with no real choice if he wanted to preserve any dignity. Sessions\u2019 undated resignation letter indicated that he was leaving at the president\u2019s \u201crequest.\u201d When, on Wednesday, Sessions asked if he could stay through the end of the week, he was told to clear out that very day. That sure looks like a firing.\n\nThis matters because of the Vacancies Reform Act, designed to improve the operations of the federal bureaucracy. For the purposes of the VRA, \u201cvacancies\u201d aren\u2019t created by firing. So if a court were to conclude that Sessions actually \u201cresigned,\u201d then Trump and Whitaker could argue that, because of the VRA, anyone working for the Department of Justice could fill the vacancy for up to seven months (210 days). This argument relies on a 2007 opinion of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel that concluded \u2015 wrongly, in my opinion \u2015 that the Attorney General Succession Act is trumped (if you will) by the VRA, a more recent and far more general statute.\n\nYet even if a court were to agree both that Sessions resigned and that the VRA applies (hardly implausible, in our increasingly pro-presidential judiciary), any federal court will recognize that the Constitution trumps all. And that\u2019s where the big guns get introduced.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe Constitution in Article II permits Congress to empower \u201cthe President alone\u201d to appoint \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d All other \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d \u2015 known as \u201cprincipal officers\u201d \u2015 must be appointed \u201cby and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a good bit of formalism in the business of deciding who\u2019s a principal officer in need of Senate confirmation and who isn\u2019t. Our history establishes that the importance of the office, taken alone, doesn\u2019t determine whether its occupant is a \u201cprincipal officer.\u201d\n\nThe office of chief of staff to the president, for example, has greater influence than, say, the secretary of agriculture (whose office is, in fact way more significant than most people realize), but the office of chief of staff has always been understood as not requiring Senate confirmation. Indeed, the role that Whitaker himself seemed to be playing as the chief of staff to Sessions may have been a bigger deal, influence-wise, than, say, Ben Carson\u2019s position as head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. But nothing in the Constitution required that Whitaker receive Senate confirmation for that role \u2015 and so he didn\u2019t.\n\nThe attorney general, however, is a principal officer entitled to Senate confirmation \u2015 as even those defending the legality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment agree. But Whitaker was never confirmed by the Senate to his new post, nor to any position in the line of succession to that role, or even to any position with similar responsibilities (the idea that his 2004 confirmation as a U.S. attorney in Iowa would apply at this date and for this position is laughable).\n\nSo how is this not an open-and-shut case? Whitaker\u2019s defenders argue that the president may appoint someone to carry out the attorney general\u2019s duties, without Senate confirmation, so long as the appointment is temporary.\n\nBut, of course, all presidentially appointed officers have time-limited terms: their commissions expire when the term of the president who appointed them ends (after 1,461 days). So being time-limited \u2013 Whitaker serves, as we\u2019ve noted, for at most 210 days \u2013 can\u2019t in itself erase the need for Senate confirmation. And the irreversible damage an acting AG Whitaker could do in 210 days \u2015 to the Mueller probe and to the nation \u2015 is enormous, making entirely implausible any argument that his appointment lacks the gravity that ultimately marks whether Senate confirmation is required.\n\nThose who think Whitaker\u2019s temporary appointment is constitutional \u2015 a group that will undoubtedly include the president\u2019s lawyers and those representing Whitaker \u2015 rely on U.S. v. Eaton, an 1898 Supreme Court case involving a consular position in Bangkok.\n\nConsul Sempronius Boyd, believing himself to be fatally ill, deputized a local missionary as vice-consul to Siam while he awaited the arrival of a Senate-appointed successor by boat. In the exigent circumstances, the Supreme Court found that an \u201cemergency appointment\u201d was justified. It stretches the imagination to suggest that even the most pro-presidential (or pro-Trump) court \u2015 including, as some have suggested, the current Supreme Court \u2015 would buy the analogy."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "One Day In, Florida's Senate Recount Gets Messier", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-recount-rick-scott-bill-nelson_us_5be8b7f6e4b0769d24ceb6c9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The race to count Florida\u2019s votes got even messier on Sunday as Gov.

Bill Nelson. Scott narrowly leads Nelson by about 0.15 percentage points, well within the state\u2019s 0.25 percent threshold for a manual recount.\n\nScott accused Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections in Broward County, of violating state law by refusing to provide information to his campaign about the number of outstanding ballots. He also alleged Susan Bucher, the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, had run afoul of state law by duplicating and damaging certain ballots. He asked a state judge to authorize law enforcement officials to \u201cimpound and secure\u201d all voting equipment when it wasn\u2019t in use for the recounts or other election-related activity. He also asked the judge to require both officials to preserve all ballots related to the 2018 elections.\n\nIn a separate suit against Snipes, Scott\u2019s campaign asked a judge to block Broward County from counting any of the ballots it didn\u2019t include in the unofficial results it submitted to the Florida Department of State by noon Saturday, a deadline set by state law. That request, if granted, could mean some valid ballots would not be counted. Florida accepts vote-by-mail ballots until 7 p.m. on Election Day and the county may not have them all counted by Saturday\u2019s deadline.\n\nReuters Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, filed multiple lawsuits Sunday regarding the election.\n\nThe populous and heavily Democratic Broward County is a key area for Nelson if he is to overcome Scott\u2019s lead. In a Sunday statement, Nelson\u2019s campaign accused Scott of trying to stop valid votes from being counted.\n\n\u201cIf Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this for the same reason he\u2019s been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud \u2015 he\u2019s worried that when all the votes are counted he\u2019ll lose this election. We will not allow him to undermine the democratic process and will use every legal tool available to protect the rights of Florida voters.\u201d\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Pe\u00f1alosa said in a statement that Scott was \u201cusing his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\u201d Pe\u00f1alosa said.\n\nThere are also recounts underway in statewide contests for governor and state agriculture commissioner. Bucher, the Palm Beach County election official, told CNN it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for her staff to meet the state\u2019s deadline for recounting the votes.\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Secretary of State\u2019s Office, told the network that if a county can\u2019t meet the deadline \u201cthen the results on file at that time take their place.\u201d The chair of the Palm Beach Republican Party told CNN that would be good news for Republicans because GOP candidates are currently leading.\n\nNelson\u2019s campaign also has a lawsuit seeking to force the state to count ballots thrown out because the signature on them didn\u2019t match the one on file with the state\u2019s voter registration.

Sometimes I get trigger point injections \u2015 shots of lidocaine into my muscles to stop them from spasming, a frequent occurrence due to my degenerative collagen disorder. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also causes my joints to frequently dislocate, randomly and without warning, causing severe and constant pain.\n\nBut the main reason I make this 40-minute drive every month is to pick up a paper prescription for my pain meds; they\u2019re considered a controlled substance, so the law forbids me from refilling them digitally. And every time I make the trip, I\u2019m reminded that even the medical world isn\u2019t designed for sick people like me.\n\nIt starts when I pull into the parking lot and decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, even though I\u2019d obviously rather use it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether my hips are dislocated that day or not; I never use my wheelchair here.\n\nThe building has an elevator I can take to the second-floor office, but it shudders and judders the whole way up, so I use the stairs. I\u2019m then met with two heavy glass doors, and if I were sitting in my chair, the handles would be too high to reach, the doors too heavy to hold. The fact there isn\u2019t an automatic door opener here has always struck me as strange.\n\nIn the waiting room, there\u2019s no space to park myself when seated in my wheelchair; I\u2019d end up inevitably being tripped on. Plus, the doorway between the waiting room and exam rooms is so narrow that wheeling through would be an impossibility (and no automatic door openers here, either). The exam tables aren\u2019t equipped to motor down to my level, which means I\u2019d have to stand up out of my chair to clamber onto the table. The entire experience would be an effort in exhaustion and inaccessibility, so I tough it out on foot instead.\n\nIn many ways, I\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine. As a partially ambulatory disabled patient with a host of chronic health conditions, I regularly run into what feels like a never-ending gamut of issues every time I visit one of my practitioners. And I\u2019m far from the exception to the rule.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine.\n\nInaccessibility issues often start long before disabled patients make it to their appointments. I can drive myself most days or schedule my appointments when my fianc\u00e9 can drive me \u2015 and good thing, because I am never asked or given recommendations about transportation (except to be told I can\u2019t drive myself home post-anesthesia). Patients with disabilities who aren\u2019t partially ambulatory like I am often have to figure out the logistics on their own, which means complicated mass transit systems or paying out of pocket for paratransit rides. Paratransit riders often have to book 24 hours in advance, usually by telephone, and most agencies make riders pay with cash or a paper voucher. If a patient is d/Deaf, they might need a teleprinter/teletypewriter \u2015 a specialized text telephone that doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2015 to schedule the ride. Requiring cash payment means disabled people now have to take the additional step of making a separate trip to the bank in order to be able to pay.\n\nAnd before you suggest them, ridesharing options like Lyft or Uber are a far cry from a solution. They\u2019re often either inaccessible or rife with discrimination. Uber was sued in 2018 for its fleet\u2019s lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Another 2018 study found that Lyft provided a wheelchair-accessible vehicle in only three of 65 attempts to request one \u2015 a disturbing 95 percent failure rate. Uber managed only 27 out of 49 attempts for a WAV. In all, researchers located a WAV in just 26 percent of attempts (compared with a 100 percent success rate for non-accessible vehicles).\n\nMedical offices themselves are an issue, too, as is the equipment inside them. Disabled patients often have difficulty using X-ray machines, rehab equipment, scales, scanning devices like MRIs and even just getting up on exam tables. Federal civil rights laws require medical offices to be accessible, but few are \u2014 and the ones that exist are hard to find. A 2012 study of 2,389 primary care facilities in California found that a mere 8 percent were equipped with a height-adjustable exam table, and less than 4 percent had an accessible weight scale. A 2013 telephone survey of 256 specialty offices across four U.S. cities for a fictional wheelchair-using patient found that 22 percent of practices reported they couldn\u2019t accommodate the patient. Amazingly, the clinicians who refused to accommodate the fictional patient also failed to recognize that their refusal was illegal under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us.\n\nThose very same ADA laws also mandate that hospitals receiving federal funding provide deaf patients with help to ensure effective communication. However, while I frequently see hospital signs declaring patients have easy access to other language interpreters, I\u2019ve never seen one mentioning the availability of an American Sign Language interpreter. And, as a patient, I\u2019m never asked about any hearing issues, even though I\u2019m hard of hearing as a result of jaw surgery in 2013 (and far too many rock concerts without earplugs). I\u2019m rarely offered alternatives to spoken communication, like written pamphlets, and I am never asked about learning disabilities like dyscalculia, dyslexia or auditory processing disorders.\n\nDoctors carry their own deeply ingrained assumptions about disability, and non-disabled doctors simply lack the understanding of what living with a disability actually entails. Research has shown that, as a result, disabled patients receive inferior health care, including less information about prevention and fewer screening tests, such as Pap tests and mammograms. A 2006 study showed disabled women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely than non-disabled women to undergo breast-conserving surgery. Those who did were still less likely to receive standard radiation therapy. Unsurprisingly, disabled people diagnosed with such cancers were significantly more likely to die as a result.\n\nPatients with intellectual disabilities (whether the diagnosis is accurate or not) are significantly more vulnerable in medical settings than the general population, and their decreased life expectancy reflects that reality. Studies show that less than 20 percent of medical schools teach their students how to talk with intellectually disabled patients about their needs. Delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment are the No. 1 reason why individuals with intellectual disabilities die at least a decade earlier than non-disabled patients on average.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability. And as with so many issues involving disabled people, we have to start at the beginning to enact fixes. Disabled people need to be involved from the ground up. This means medical schools need to offer clear instruction that teaches future doctors how to interact with and examine disabled patients, but it also means that medical schools need to be more accessible when including and training disabled students to become future doctors. More disabled doctors mean a more widespread need and appreciation for accessibility \u2015 for patients and for those giving care, too.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability.\n\nAs usual, this means our world as a whole needs to place a much higher focus on making the world more accessible. I\u2019ve written before about how music venues and airline travel are widely inaccessible to wheelchair users, and medicine is no different. Our society hasn\u2019t yet insisted upon accessibility as a bare minimum, and disabled humans suffer as a result. It\u2019s an ouroboros of epic proportions: Disabled people are forcibly excluded, which is why non-disabled people don\u2019t think to include us. It often starts in preschool or elementary school, when the buildings are inaccessible, and continues through high school and extends into higher ed. When we can\u2019t pursue higher levels of education, we are excluded from job opportunities. Exclusion from job opportunities means we aren\u2019t the ones in medical school, insisting upon education about how to properly treat us \u2014 and we aren\u2019t the architects helping design accessible hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices, either.\n\nDisabled people make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, but 20 percent isn\u2019t enough to enact change, no matter how loud we\u2019re yelling. We need non-disabled people to join the rallying cry. If you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us. Old age will alter your mobility, your functionality, your ability to move and your autonomy. At some point, the heavy glass doors at your doctor\u2019s office will stymy you, too. Wouldn\u2019t you rather the world be an accessible place before that happens?"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Congo Is In The Midst Of The Worst Ebola Outbreak In Its History, Officials Say", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congo-ebola-outbreak_us_5be7ea1fe4b0769d24ce1f0b", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "KINSHASA, Congo (AP) \u2014 Congo\u2019s latest Ebola outbreak is the worst in the country\u2019s recorded history with 319 confirmed and probable cases, the health ministry said.\n\nThe deadly virus has killed more than 190 people since the outbreak was declared Aug. 1 in the volatile east.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-12 09:01:31", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013.
