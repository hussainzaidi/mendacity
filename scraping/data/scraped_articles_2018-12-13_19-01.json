She agreed to turn over any evidence of crimes she is aware of, submit a full accounting of her financial assets, sit for interviews with law enforcement (and waive right to counsel during those interviews) and testify before grand juries or in trials in Washington or elsewhere.\n\nShe faces a maximum of five years in prison and will likely be deported after serving any time. A hearing was set for February to discuss a sentencing date.\n\nIn court, Butina said her mind was \"absolutely clear.\" This comes in contrast to her lawyer's previous notice to the court that as of late November, she was in solitary confinement in jail and the conditions were \"starting to have a profound psychological impact\" on her.\n\nSince late November, Butina has been allowed time out of the cell at night and for other activities, including for church and to visit with a Russian orthodox minister, which has helped her mental state, her attorney Robert Driscoll said.\n\nWork to infiltrate conservative circles\n\nThe conspiracy, as prosecutors described it in court, kicked off no later than March 2015 with a draft proposal Butina wrote to Torshin and others called the \"Description of the Diplomacy Project.\"\n\nIt described her plan to become an unofficial conduit of communication between Russia and the US, especially through the Republican Party, at a time when the two governments were less willing to negotiate formally. She had also planned to use $125,000 from Torshin to attend conferences associated with the GOP -- particularly the NRA, which she believed \"had influence over\" the Republican Party, she admitted.\n\nNRA members also received her invitation to visit Moscow and meet with high-ranking Russian politicians. Torshin and \"US Person 1\", whom CNN identified as Butina's boyfriend Paul Erickson, a GOP political operative, helped her prepare for the trip. After the trip in December 2015, she said to her Russian backer, \"We should let them express their gratitude now, we will put pressure on them quietly later.\"\n\nShe helped a US citizen host \"friendship dinners\" with other wealthy and influential Americans to talk about US-Russian policy, prosecutors said and Butina admitted in court.\n\nButina organized a delegation and oversaw invitations to attend the National Prayer breakfast in 2017. She noted to Erickson at the time that the people were \"coming to establish a back channel of communication.\"\n\nShe also admitted that Torshin \"did not believe\" the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs would \"go for it\" when she asked him in November 2016 \"how to create a dialogue with the then President-elect's advisers,\" prosecutors said in court, referring to advisers of Donald Trump.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday that Butina took the deal \"to survive.\"\n\n\"She used this option to survive,\" Zakharova told CNN. She has described Butina's arrest as politically motivated.\n\nErickson's defense attorney, William Hurd, attended the plea hearing. After the hearing, he said he would speak to his client before deciding whether to make a public statement. He said he did not know in which jurisdiction Butina would be helping a criminal investigation, if she does indeed cooperate with one involving Erickson.\n\nButina spoke from jail with journalist\n\nUS District Judge Tanya Chutkan began Thursday's court session by revealing why Butina was appointed a public defender.\n\nChutkan said that prosecutors had tapes of a call Butina made from jail with a journalist and that prosecutors flagged this to the judge as a potential conflict of interest. On the call, Butina referred to someone whom prosecutors believe could be her lawyer about acting as a go-between to pass messages to journalists.\n\nChutkan said she did not find that Butina's lawyer Driscoll acted improperly, but said it was why a public defender was appointed.\n\nDuring the calls, the prosecutors also learned that Butina told other inmates to talk to her lawyer and to speak to the media on her behalf.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Sources: Maria Butina bragged of Russian ties", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ZfTCmXhtFXw/maria-butina-alleged-russian-spy-bragged-murray-dnt-tsr-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Maria Butina, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent in the US, tended to brag about her ties to Russian intelligence when she was intoxicated, according to people familiar with the situation.

Last week, opposing sides began direct talks under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nBut even as the negotiations continue in Sweden, there is no respite in Yemen, where the most vulnerable face the dual threat of war and hunger. The UN says half of Yemen's population -- about 14 million people -- are at risk of famine.\n\nA Saudi coalition spokesperson denied responsibility for the December 8 attack shown in the video from the Houthi-run Ansarallah Media Center. \"We have no knowledge of this, and it is widely recognized that the Houthi militia is continuing to target civilians with all types of weapons in Hodeida province and its cities,\" Colonel Turki al-Malki told CNN.\n\nAmerica's role in Yemen\n\nThe Trump administration's role in Yemen's tragedy came under increased scrutiny after a CNN investigation found remnants of a US-made bomb at the scene of an airstrike in the northern province of Saada that left dozens of children dead in August. The Saudi coalition told CNN the missile strike was aimed at a \"legitimate target.\"\n\nThe US says it does not make targeting decisions for the coalition, which is fighting a Houthi rebel insurgency in Yemen. But it provides support for its operations through billions of dollars in arms sales and some sharing of intelligence.\n\nThe problem for the administration is that patience for the Saudis is running out on Capitol Hill. Some Senators are particularly riled by the CIA's conclusion, according to sources, that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.\n\nThe Saudi government has denied that bin Salman was involved in Khashoggi's death, and US President Donald Trump has also been at odds with the CIA assessment.\n\n\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said in a statement last month.\n\nAfter Khashoggi was murdered, the US stopped airborne refueling of Saudi aircraft involved in the conflict.\n\nNow, momentum is growing behind a proposal to invoke a never-before-used provision of the War Powers Act, which allows Congress to order the President to withdraw from a conflict.\n\n\"It's un-American,\" said Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, of Trump's suggestions that US arms sales with Saudi Arabia take precedence over a forceful to response to a journalist's murder. \"When we provide aid to other countries, we do so because we want to see good things happen in those countries.

This will be the last -- and strongest -- meteor shower of the year, according to NASA.\n\nThis phenomenon was first recorded in 1862 and causes a show each December\n\nIn the hours before sunrise Friday, the most meteors will be visible in the North American sky, peaking about 7:30 a.m. ET, predicts Sky & Telescope . To see when they will peak in your part of the world, check here\n\nBut the morning isn't your only chance. On Thursday and Friday, keep an eye on the sky a few hours after sunset -- just keep the moon at your back.\n\nAlthough the Geminid shower is known for its \"shooting stars,\" the number of meteors visible depends on the time and how dark it is . There will be fewer of them earlier in the evening, but the shower should hit a maximum of about 100 per hour around 2 a.m., NASA said. For those in the suburbs, expect about 30 to 40 per hour. And if you're in a city like New York, San Francisco or Atlanta, you probably won't see anything.\n\nEarly evening meteors may be longer, with dramatic streaks that last several seconds. Later on, the meteors will present quicker streaks or leave trails of smoke that appear to glow.\n\nThe asteroid 3200 Phaethon is responsible for this meteor shower, which is unusual because comets usually create meteor showers with icy debris. Scientists have debated the very nature of what Phaethon is. The closely tracked near-Earth asteroid has been likened to comets, so it's been called a \"rock comet.\"\n\nPhaethon was discovered in October 1983 and named after the Greek myth about the son of Helios, the sun god, because it closely approaches our sun.\n\nPhaethon orbits the sun closer than any other asteroid and takes 1.4 years to orbit it. The asteroid heats to about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit on closest approach to the sun, which causes it to shed dusty debris.\n\nThese particles cause the meteor shower when they plunge into Earth's atmosphere at 22 miles per second, vaporizing in the streaks we call \"shooting stars.\"\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn't littered with city lights that will obstruct your view. If you're able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from 10 p.m. until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky, and don't forget to bundle up. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up.

She agreed to turn over any evidence of crimes she is aware of, submit a full accounting of her financial assets, sit for interviews with law enforcement (and waive right to counsel during those interviews) and testify before grand juries or in trials in Washington or elsewhere.\n\nShe faces a maximum of five years in prison and will likely be deported after serving any time. A hearing was set for February to discuss a sentencing date.\n\nIn court, Butina said her mind was \"absolutely clear.\" This comes in contrast to her lawyer's previous notice to the court that as of late November, she was in solitary confinement in jail and the conditions were \"starting to have a profound psychological impact\" on her.\n\nSince late November, Butina has been allowed time out of the cell at night and for other activities, including for church and to visit with a Russian orthodox minister, which has helped her mental state, her attorney Robert Driscoll said.\n\nWork to infiltrate conservative circles\n\nThe conspiracy, as prosecutors described it in court, kicked off no later than March 2015 with a draft proposal Butina wrote to Torshin and others called the \"Description of the Diplomacy Project.\"\n\nIt described her plan to become an unofficial conduit of communication between Russia and the US, especially through the Republican Party, at a time when the two governments were less willing to negotiate formally. She had also planned to use $125,000 from Torshin to attend conferences associated with the GOP -- particularly the NRA, which she believed \"had influence over\" the Republican Party, she admitted.\n\nNRA members also received her invitation to visit Moscow and meet with high-ranking Russian politicians. Torshin and \"US Person 1\", whom CNN identified as Butina's boyfriend Paul Erickson, a GOP political operative, helped her prepare for the trip. After the trip in December 2015, she said to her Russian backer, \"We should let them express their gratitude now, we will put pressure on them quietly later.\"\n\nShe helped a US citizen host \"friendship dinners\" with other wealthy and influential Americans to talk about US-Russian policy, prosecutors said and Butina admitted in court.\n\nButina organized a delegation and oversaw invitations to attend the National Prayer breakfast in 2017. She noted to Erickson at the time that the people were \"coming to establish a back channel of communication.\"\n\nShe also admitted that Torshin \"did not believe\" the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs would \"go for it\" when she asked him in November 2016 \"how to create a dialogue with the then President-elect's advisers,\" prosecutors said in court, referring to advisers of Donald Trump.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday that Butina took the deal \"to survive.\"\n\n\"She used this option to survive,\" Zakharova told CNN. She has described Butina's arrest as politically motivated.\n\nErickson's defense attorney, William Hurd, attended the plea hearing. After the hearing, he said he would speak to his client before deciding whether to make a public statement. He said he did not know in which jurisdiction Butina would be helping a criminal investigation, if she does indeed cooperate with one involving Erickson.\n\nButina spoke from jail with journalist\n\nUS District Judge Tanya Chutkan began Thursday's court session by revealing why Butina was appointed a public defender.\n\nChutkan said that prosecutors had tapes of a call Butina made from jail with a journalist and that prosecutors flagged this to the judge as a potential conflict of interest. On the call, Butina referred to someone whom prosecutors believe could be her lawyer about acting as a go-between to pass messages to journalists.\n\nChutkan said she did not find that Butina's lawyer Driscoll acted improperly, but said it was why a public defender was appointed.\n\nDuring the calls, the prosecutors also learned that Butina told other inmates to talk to her lawyer and to speak to the media on her behalf.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "READ: Maria Butina plea agreement", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/_Qy9k0gk0O0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Burr and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel's top Democrat, have waited to speak to -- or in some cases re-interview -- several key officials after they agreed to cooperate with Mueller, but the opportunity could soon be approaching.\n\nThe committee has been engaged in discussions with the special counsel and defense attorneys to get access to several cooperating Mueller witnesses in addition to Cohen, including Flynn, Papadopoulos and Gates, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe panel has also continued to revisit past interviews as it has learned more, including from Mueller's court filings, another source familiar with the probe said.\n\n\"There were a number of witnesses that they needed to go through the legal proceedings with Mueller first,\" Warner said. \"Once those proceedings are finished\" the committee can move forward, he said, \"and for many of them they are finished now.\"\n\nThe expected incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, has also expressed a desire to speak again to Cohen, who testified behind closed doors before both intelligence panels last year. Schiff has said he's in touch with Cohen's legal team, too.\n\nSchiff told CNN he also wants to interview Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone, as well as Stone's confidant Jerome Corsi, about their contacts with WikiLeaks. But those two men are fighting the special counsel, and it's unclear whether Congress will succeed in bringing them in to testify.\n\n\"We certainly are going to want to continue the investigative lead thread about ... the contacts Trump campaign associates had with WikiLeaks,\" Schiff said, adding that Stone's 2017 testimony before his panel \"may have been far less than truthful.\"\n\nCohen willing to testify\n\nCohen was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison on a number of charges, including lying to Congress about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project when he testified last year.\n\nHe was scheduled to report to prison by March 6. Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis said in a statement that his client was willing to speak to Congress again once Mueller's investigation is complete. \"At the appropriate time, after Mr. Mueller completes his investigation and issues his final report, I look forward to assisting Michael to state publicly all he knows about Mr. Trump -- and that includes any appropriate congressional committee interested in the search for truth and the difference between facts and lies,\" Davis said.\n\nBut it's not clear whether congressional leaders will wait for Mueller, since the special counsel has not tipped his hand to when he will wrap up.\n\n\"I'm not sure how we get him from jail,\" Burr said Wednesday. \"I can only tell you we're in conversations and have been with Michael Cohen's legal staff, and we think there's a great likelihood he will come in to talk to us.\"\n\nAsked if he would issue a subpoena for Cohen's testimony, Burr said: \"We'll chat.\"\n\nIt's unclear what Burr knows about details from Mueller's filing that a Russian national approached Cohen in 2015 offering \"political synergy\" with the Trump campaign. Asked about the revelation, Burr said: \"I think it all dealt with business. He was doing a business deal.\"\n\nNegotiating with other witnesses\n\nThe Senate committee has also been engaged with others who were sentenced in the Mueller probe.\n\nThe panel sought testimony from Papadopoulos, for instance, but he requested immunity from the committee before he was interviewed, CNN reported in October. Papadopoulos has since served his two-week sentence for lying to the FBI.\n\nThe committee reached out to Flynn in the opening days of its Russia probe, although he had requested immunity in March 2017 to testify. The committee has continued to stay in touch with Flynn's attorneys as he's pleaded guilty and subsequently cooperated with Mueller, one of the sources said. Flynn will be sentenced later this month, and the special counsel has recommended no jail time.\n\nThe committee interviewed Manafort last year before he was indicted by the special counsel -- and before many twists and turns tied to the Russia investigations were unearthed -- although pursuing another interview with him could be more complicated, given that the special counsel is now accusing Manafort of lying after he had agreed to cooperate.\n\nJason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, said that if the committee sends Manafort a formal request to appear, he would address it.\n\n\"Mr. Manafort answered every question he was asked, and I've never heard concerns raised that he was anything other than honest and forthright,\" Maloni said of Manafort's July 2017 testimony.\n\nWarner said there was no way to know yet what the special counsel probe may have uncovered that the Senate investigation hasn't learned, though he acknowledged Mueller had more tools to convince witnesses to talk.\n\n\"There are a number of key individuals who, because of the power to bring criminal charges, they clearly have been more cooperative with Mueller,\" Warner said. \"He has more leverage over some of the key witnesses, and in many cases, you know, we get to a certain point and then we run into someone who is under the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nBurr said at a forum last month that the Senate Intelligence Committee has referred multiple individuals to the special counsel for prosecution, including for lying to the committee, a charge that Cohen pleaded guilty to last week.\n\nSchiff has suggested that witnesses may have lied during his committee's Russia investigation, too, such as Stone, though Stone has denied he lied. Schiff says he wants to send his panel's interview transcripts to Mueller if they aren't released publicly before Democrats take control of the House next month.\n\n\"It's our intention to make them available ASAP to the special counsel,\" Schiff said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Warner said he was eager to learn exactly what it was that Cohen had lied to the committee about -- and what else he had told Mueller.\n\n\"I'm anxious to learn what those are,\" Warner said. \"What other stories, what other facts did Mr. Cohen lay out to the special prosecutor?\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Democratic Rep.

A US study measured calories in the most frequently ordered meals in 116 restaurants across five countries -- Brazil, China, Finland, Ghana and India -- comparing them against the United States.\n\nThe calorie content of the most popular meals in British and international restaurant chains is excessive, and only a minority meet public health recommendations, the researchers found. In the global study, only China was found to serve \"significantly less energy than restaurants in the US.\"\n\nFast food, it concluded, contained on average 33% fewer calories than more formal restaurant meals.\n\nThe UK's health agency, Public Health England, recommended that lunches and evening meals should not exceed 600 calories (also measured as kcal). But almost none of the restaurants surveyed reflected this.\n\n\"We found that the number of calories in the average restaurant meal was more than the number of calories in the average fast food meal,\" said Eric Robinson, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Liverpool, who led the UK study. \"A lot of people would expect there to be more calories in fast food, but our findings were counter to that.\"\n\n'Fast food comes out as the good guy'\n\nThe average main meal dish at a fast food chain in the UK contained 751 calories, compared with an average of 1,033 at sit-down restaurants. Only 11% of full-service dishes served at the 21 restaurants studied -- including Pizza Express, Zizzi and Wagamama -- met the recommended limit of 600 calories, though that rose to 17% in fast food meals.\n\nThese restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe worst-performing of the British fast food outlets, KFC, had an average of 987 calories per meal, but it fared better than more than half of the sit-down restaurants. Meanwhile, an average meal at Burger King (711 calories) proved less calorific than every one of the traditional restaurants surveyed.\n\nThe worst offenders were named as Hungry Horse, where the average meal contained 1,358 calories, followed by Sizzling Pubs (1,269 calories) and Flaming Grill Pubs (1,232 calories).\n\nSizzling Pubs' parent company, Mitchells and Butlers, said in a statement, \"We share nutritional information online for guests to access and we are very mindful of our role in helping guests make knowledgeable decisions about what they eat and drink while dining with us.\n\n\"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes and have also committed to the Public Health England Sugar Reduction programme.\"\n\nThe other restaurants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe international study, which didn't name specific restaurants, found an average of 809 calories in main meal dishes served by fast food chains and 1,317 calories in restaurant chains. Only the Chinese served fewer calories than Americans: 1,045 calories in full-service, compared with 1,362 in US eateries, and 561 in fast food restaurants, as opposed to 969 in America. Indian meals tended to be higher in calories; restaurants in the remaining countries were comparable to those in the United States.\n\nOnce again, a small minority of meals met the 600-calorie recommendation, with 94% of full-service dishes and 72% of fast food dishes exceeding this limit.\n\nRobinson said that although there is considerable debate in Britain about forcing restaurants to display calorie content, only 9% of the meals his research covered met the maximum.\n\n\"So even if you want to know about calories on the menu, you are not left with many meals to choose from,\" he said. \"Restaurants need to serve fewer calories. There are a lot of meals that have far too many calories, whether it's due to portion sizes, ingredients or cooking methods.\n\n\"The bigger issue it relates to is that we are living in a food environment that encourages and causes people to eat more calories than they need,\" he said. \"If a government is serious about trying to reduce obesity and the number of people who die young because of poor diet and obesity, then the food environment is something that needs to be addressed and tackled.\"\n\nSusan Roberts, senior scientist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, was the lead author of the international study. \"Until now, fast food has been criticized all the time, but in this study, fast food comes out as the good guy,\" she said. \"It was still bad, but it had 33% less calories than standard restaurants.\"\n\nPotential steps to be taken include reducing portion sizes or even introducing proportional prices for restaurant meals, Roberts said. In other words, people would be required to pay for the portions they ordered rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n\"I think that most of us would be delighted to be able to go into a restaurant and order the size that we actually want. But that would mean that restaurants would have to actually recognize that they are part of the problem, which I think they will deny,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe authors of both reports said no firm conclusions could be drawn, as both were observational. However, they also warned that their findings may not fully reflect the reality, as they did not take in to account drinks, appetizers, desserts or side orders.\n\n'Step up and take responsibility'\n\nCaroline Cerny, lead of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 40 British organizations and charities, noted that \"regularly eating excess calories over time leads to weight gain.\"\n\n\"Children these days are growing up in an obesogenic environment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to make healthy choices. That's why we welcome government proposals to introduce mandatory calorie labeling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaway. But we also need the whole food industry, including restaurants, to step up and take responsibility for making healthier eating easier, by reducing calories and sugar in their meals by 20% in line with government targets.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTam Fry, chairman of the UK's National Obesity Forum, welcomed the findings but said he thought Public Health England's 600-calorie recommendation was \"unrealistic\".\n\n\"We have all become so accustomed to eating so much more now that I think a more realistic maximum would be about 800 calories,\" he said. \"The restaurant industry has got to clean up its act, but I fear it won't do it voluntarily because they feel they will lose custom.

Hoffer answered, and he heard: \"This is the State Department. We have a problem.\"\n\nHoffer was told that an individual in Havana was hearing odd noises, experiencing pain and ringing in the ear, and feeling dizzy and confused.\n\nThat person, and others with similar symptoms, were United States diplomatic personnel living in Cuba -- and the cause of their symptoms remains a medical mystery.\n\nIn August 2017, State Department officials said the cause may have been a possible \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices. Cuba officials have arduously denied such an attack.\n\nHoffer, a professor of otolaryngology and neurological surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida, examined some of those personnel along with his colleagues.\n\nNow Hoffer and his colleagues -- from the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh -- are revealing new details on those symptoms seen among the 25 diplomats in a study, published in the journal Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology on Wednesday.\n\nIn this retrospective study, the researchers described their findings as \"the first report of the acute symptoms in this patient group.\"\n\nA separate study, previously published in the medical journal JAMA in March, described the symptoms of 21 personnel who sought medical attention and found that a majority of them reported problems with memory, concentration, balance, eyesight, hearing, sleeping or headaches that lasted more than three months. Three people eventually needed hearing aids for moderate to severe hearing loss, and others had ringing or pressure in their ears according to that report.\n\nBeginning in 2016 and throughout last year, several diplomats and their family members stationed in Havana reported hearing bizarre noises and experiencing a range of symptoms, such as dizziness, ear pain, and ringing in the ears.\n\nWhen it comes to exactly what they were suffering from, \"what caused it, who did it, why it was done, we don't know any of those things,\" Hoffer said during a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe US State Department and federal investigators have been unable to definitively attribute the source or cause of these symptoms, but in August last year, several department officials told CNN they might have been the result of an \"acoustic attack\" using sonic devices.\n\nCuban officials have strenuously denied that there were any targeted attacks on diplomats in Havana and said their symptoms could have been caused by other factors.\n\n\"All has been speculation or manipulated information,\" Cuba's Director General for US Affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Wednesday about the US investigation into the health incidents.\n\n\"The concrete questions have not been asked. Why has the US government not been ready to cooperate with Cuba? What is the US government hiding? Why is it not capable of putting forward concrete, real information that the scientific community can accept?\"\n\nThe study released Wednesday details symptoms experienced by 15 men and 10 women.\n\nThey all reported being exposed to either some strange noise or pressure and then immediately after that exposure, the majority felt intense ear pain and ringing, according to the study.

She has been in custody since July.\n\nShe has also agreed to co-operate with investigators. Prosecutors expect the deal will give them information about Russia's efforts to interfere in US politics.\n\nHer lawyer, Robert Driscoll, estimates that she could face up to six months in prison, Reuters news agency reports. She is being held at an adult detention centre in Virginia.\n\nThe case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election in an attempt to secure victory for Donald Trump.\n\nWho is Maria Butina?\n\nBorn in the southern Siberian city of Barnaul in 1988, according to her Facebook page, she has enjoyed using weapons ever since she was a child, picking up a gun for the first time at the age of 10.\n\nShe founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms and called for the sale of short-barrelled firearms to civilians to be made legal.\n\nIn 2012 he became a life member of the powerful NRA and began travelling to the US for its conventions. In 2015 she attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas, asking the presidential candidate about his views on US sanctions against Russia.\n\nBy 2016 she had a student visa to study for a Master's degree at American University in Washington DC.\n\nA piece of a larger puzzle\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher in Washington\n\nIn some ways, Maria Butina was like any other young, ambitious, aspiring political player in Washington DC trying to network their way to power and status. The difference, of course, is that she was a Russian national in communication with, and taking actions to advance the interest of, influential Russian officials.\n\nTo do so without registering with the US government is a federal crime - and now she faces a prison sentence and deportation.\n\nThe details outlined in the plea agreement are not exactly the stuff of spy novels. She arranged a Russian delegation to a prestigious Washington prayer event, hobnobbed at the National Rifle Association convention and organised a visit by US gun rights advocates to Moscow. Taken in isolation, these \"informal channels of communication\" with American conservatives could have helped improve US-Russia relations but were hardly nefarious.\n\nViewed in the context of other Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election presented by Robert Mueller's investigation - including hacking Democratic Party communications, waging an illicit social media campaign, and funding and organising on-the ground political rallies and protests - and the Butina plea seems more like a small but potentially meaningful piece of a much larger puzzle.\n\nWhat are the accusations against her?\n\nFederal prosecutors have claimed that Ms Butina was directed by a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political groups, including an unnamed pro-gun lobbying organisation that is presumed to be the NRA, which is close to Mr Trump's Republican Party.\n\nOne of the two Americans cited in the case has been identified in US media as Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based conservative political activist who was dating Ms Butina.

Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, if a majority of MPs backed a no-confidence motion, it would start a countdown which would lead to an early election, if no successor government was able to win a vote of confidence within 14 days.\n\nThe Labour leadership's main aim has always been to force an election, which it believes Mr Corbyn will win.\n\nSo what are they waiting for?\n\n\"We're fully prepared to bring a no-confidence vote when we know we can win,\" said Labour chairman Ian Lavery in a video message on Facebook, but, he added, doing so too soon would \"serve only to strengthen Theresa May\".\n\nWhy would a no-confidence be likely to fail now?\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs the Tories rely on for a majority, have promised to support the government in a confidence motion.\n\nThey want to give her time to seek changes to her EU withdrawal deal.\n\nBut their support is not tied to Mrs May personally and they would not back her if she sought to press ahead with her deal without ditching the Northern Ireland \"backstop\" clause, which they object to.\n\nSo why the clamour for one as soon as possible?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The People's Vote campaign is urging Jeremy Corbyn to back a referendum\n\nMr Corbyn has been accused of \"cowardice\" and of failing to provide proper opposition by the SNP, the Lib Dems and others, for apparently sitting on the sidelines as the Conservative Party tears itself to pieces over Brexit.\n\nBut Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, has warned that the Labour leader should not be \"bounced\" into holding a no-confidence vote by \"those who have little or no interest in seeing Labour elected\".\n\nMr Corbyn has said he has no confidence in the government but will wait for an \"appropriate\" time to strike.\n\nThose pushing for a no-confidence vote as soon as possible are mostly advocates of a further EU referendum - and their best, possibly their only, hope of getting one is if Labour gets behind it.\n\nThey include the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, a small group of Conservatives and MPs from Labour's pro-EU \"moderate\" wing like Chuka Umunna and Margaret Beckett, who are not natural allies of Mr Corbyn.\n\nLabour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Tom Watson are also reported to be in the \"just get on with it\" camp.\n\nMr Corbyn bowed to pressure from his own party members at this year's Labour conference - the majority of whom, polls suggest, want another referendum.\n\nThe party leadership said it would consider supporting another referendum if it fails in its bid to get a general election.\n\nSo the strategy of those pushing Mr Corbyn for a no-confidence vote depends, to some extent, on that vote failing.\n\nWhy don't the SNP and the others table their own no-confidence vote?\n\nThey are threatening to do this - but it would be largely symbolic, without Labour's backing.\n\nAny MP can table a motion of no confidence but it is unlikely to be given Parliamentary time without the support of a major party - and it would stand very little chance of success without the backing of the main opposition party.\n\nWhen could a no-confidence vote be held?\n\nSome are arguing for a vote next Monday, when Mrs May makes a statement to the Commons on Thursday's EU summit.\n\nBut it is more likely to be in the New Year when MPs finally get a vote on Mrs May's deal with the EU, which she is widely expected to lose.\n\nSome in the pro-referendum camp fear this will be too late to get a referendum together.\n\nAnd some - such as Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts - have suggested this would suit Mr Corbyn, who, she said, might be \"comfortable\" with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhat is the Labour leadership's position on a no-deal Brexit?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption John McDonnell: No majority for a no-deal Brexit\n\nThey are adamant that this is the last thing they want.

Respect.\"\n\nEuropean Parliament: Brexit deal 'not open to renegotiation'\n\nThe European Parliament has issued a statement saying the Brexit deal brokered between May and European Union officials is \"not open to renegotiation\".\n\n\"The Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration are fair and balanced and represent, given EU principles, current UK red lines and the commitments set out in the Good Friday Agreement, the only deal possible to ensure an orderly withdrawal from the European Union,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The Conference reiterated that, without a backstop, Parliament would not give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement \u2026 [and] its support for as close as possible future EU-UK relationship such that the deployment of the backstop would not be necessary,\" it added.\n\nThe statement was drawn up by the parliament's governing body, the Conference of Presidents, in coordination with its Brexit Steering Group.\n\nMay urges party support in no-confidence vote\n\nMay is speaking to dozens of Conservative lawmakers less than half an hour before a no-confidence vote among them that will decide her fate.\n\nMay was greeted by table banging as she entered a room in the House of Commons to address backbenchers.\n\nThat is a customary sign of approval, but May faces a tough crowd that includes rivals such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis.\n\nBoth are among critics of May's Brexit deal with the European Union.\n\nTory Brexiteers are hoping to topple May in Wednesday evening's vote. She is making a last-minute appeal, saying ditching her now would plunge the country into even more uncertainty.\n\nOne legislator who attended, James Cleverly, said May \"made it very clear that there is a job of work to be done [on Brexit] and this is a delay and a distraction\".\n\n'No renegotiation' of Brexit deal, says Paris\n\nThere will be \"no renegotiation\" of the Brexit divorce deal concluded between the European Union and Britain, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned on Wednesday.\n\n\"There will be no renegotiation,\" he told the French National Assembly as May fights to sell the deal to the British parliament.\n\n\"There were long negotiations lasting several months that ended with a text agreed by both parties, which was to have been submitted yesterday to the British parliament, and which the British prime minister decided to hold back because of lack of support,\" Le Drian said.\n\nThe key stumbling block is the so-called \"backstop\" which aims to avoid the return of a \"hard border\" between the two Irelands, he added.\n\nMay is to meet Thursday in Brussels with the 27 remaining EU leaders to discuss the deal, \"but there will be no renegotiation\" of the deal, Le Drian said.\n\n\"Observations might be made, and, as you know, the prime minister is in trouble with her own party and faces a confidence vote this evening so we are looking at a complex situation,\" he added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also told the German parliament on Wednesday that the Brexit deal would not be amended.\n\nMay will raise parliament backstop row at EU summit: spokesman\n\nMay will take the opportunity to discuss with other EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday the message parliament has given about the Brexit deal, her spokesman said on Wednesday.\n\nHe said May would use a planned trip to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to discuss the situation in parliament, which has reacted with anger over the so-called backstop arrangement for Northern Ireland.\n\n\"It is obviously an opportunity for the PM to address the 27 [other EU leaders] about the message that the House of Commons has sent about wanting more assurances about the backstop,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity to discuss that at leader level.\"\n\nScottish leader criticises May's party over Brexit 'chaos'\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said today's move by Conservative members of parliament to trigger a vote of confidence on May was a \"stark reminder that the UK is facing chaos and crisis entirely because of a vicious civil war within the Tory party\".\n\n\"What a self-centred bunch they are. They all need to go, not just the PM,\" she said on Twitter.\n\nSturgeon's Scottish National Party has called on the main opposition Labour Party to follow through with an earlier threat to table a parliamentary no-confidence motion against May.\n\nCameron backs May ahead of key Brexit vote\n\nFormer British Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed his support for May, the incumbent leader, as she prepares to face a vote of confidence by parliamentary colleagues from her ruling Conservative Party.\n\n\"I hope Conservative MPs will back the PM in the vote today. We need no distractions from seeking the best outcome with our neighbours, friends and partners in the EU,\" Cameron said on Twitter.\n\nAs prime minister, Cameron initiated the UK's 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, which saw 52 percent of Britons opt to quit the bloc.\n\nHaving argued in favour of the UK remaining in the EU, he swiftly resigned in the wake of the leave result.\n\nBetting odds indicate May will win no-confidence vote\n\nThe betting odds have shifted sharply towards May surviving a no-confidence vote on Wednesday after a leadership contest was called by legislators unhappy with her handling of Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nThe shift comes after a flurry of bets that she will win the vote and more than 158 Conservative Party MPs publicly backed the prime minister.\n\nThe likelihood that May will the win the vote has risen to 89 percent, according to bookmakers William Hill, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes.\n\nEarlier in the day, William Hill said there was a 60 percent chance she will survive and Paddy Power gave odds of 71 percent.\n\n\"The money suggests that Theresa May will survive today's vote,\" said Rupert Adams, a William Hill spokesman. \"But things remain bleak and we fully expect her to leave office in 2019.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to fight for her political future with \"everything I've got\" as the UK's bid to depart the European Union descends into a deepening political crisis.\n\nMembers of May's ruling Conservative Party reached the threshold of 48 demands needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership.\n\nIf May loses, her successor would be chosen from existing Conservative MPs and would automatically become prime minister.\n\n\n\nBut if she wins, she will be immune to further challenges for a year. The result is due around 21:00 GMT.\n\nEmbattled PM issues Brexit warning to party members\n\nIn a stark warning to Brexit-supporting opponents who instigated the challenge, May said if they toppled her then the EU exit would be delayed, perhaps even stopped.\n\nA new leader would not have time to renegotiate a deal with the EU and secure parliamentary approval by the end of March, meaning the Article 50 withdrawal notice would have to be extended or rescinded, she said.\n\n\"A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,\" she said.\n\n\"Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country.\"\n\nAccording to the rules, May could be toppled if a simple majority of Conservative MPs vote against her. At least 153 of her 315 Conservative MPs had expressed public support for her by 12:55 GMT.\n\nGerman government approves Brexit legislation\n\nGermany's cabinet has approved legislation to protect British residents' rights in the country in the event of a no-deal Brexit and to make the country a more attractive location for banks seeking to relocate.\n\nBrexit jargon: From backstop to no deal, 17 key terms explained\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said ministers have approved a bill safeguarding the German health insurance, unemployment insurance and pension status of British citizens living in Germany and German citizens living in Britain at the time of Brexit.\n\nAnother German bill foresees loosening the requirement for banks to justify why they're ending a contract with a highly paid employee deemed to be a \"bearer of risk,\" such as heads of department or high-volume traders.\n\nGermany has much more restrictive rules on dismissing workers than Britain, which is seen as a disincentive for Britain-based banks to shift operations to Frankfurt.\n\nBritish currency jumps as BBC forecasts May to win vote\n\nThe British pound jumped on Wednesday after the BBC reported that a majority of Conservative Party MPs were set to back May in a no-confidence vote.\n\nAt about 13:30 GMT, the pound advanced to $1.2579, having earlier hit a fresh 20-month low at $1.2478. The pound recovered to 90.18 pence versus the euro.\n\nAccording to the BBC, May was set to win the vote with at least 158 Conservative MPs - more than 50 percent of those eligible - having pledged their support for the embattled premier."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Two babies die at IDP camp on Syria-Jordan border, UN says", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/babies-die-idp-camp-syria-jordan-border-181213151700160.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Two babies have died after an illness in the past week at a camp for internally displaced people on the Syrian border with Jordan, as the United Nations children's agency reiterates calls for humanitarian access to the camp.\n\nThe deaths took place in Rukban camp, which lies in an inhospitable stretch of desert.\n\n\"Another sad week for children and families in Rukban.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Pelosi: 4-Year Maximum in Speaker Post Is 'a Long Time'", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/pelosi-4-year-maximum-in-speaker-post-is-a-long-time-/4699423.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Rep. Nancy Pelosi shrugged off suggestions Thursday that she weakened herself by agreeing to limit her tenure as next House speaker to a four-year maximum, a deal that clears the way for her to be elected to the post for the new Congress.\n\n\"That's a long time,\" she said at a news conference a day after she and seven insurgents who'd been pushing for younger leadership announced their pact.\n\nFor weeks, the 78-year-old California Democrat had resisted opponents' demands that she step aside or restrict how long she'd serve, saying limits would make her a lame duck and sap her bargaining clout. But on Wednesday she relented and struck a deal that all but guarantees she'll be elected when the House votes on its new speaker on January 3.\n\n\"What, four years? No, I don't think that's a lame duck,\" she told a group of reporters afterward.\n\nDemocrats widely agreed that the pledge meant Pelosi had clinched a comeback to the post she held from 2007 until January 2011, the last time her party ran the House and the first time the speaker was a woman.\n\nWednesday's accord gives Pelosi a clear path to becoming the most powerful Democrat in government and a leading role in confronting President Donald Trump during the upcoming 2020 presidential and congressional campaigns.\n\nIt moves a 78-year-old white woman to the cusp of steering next year's diverse crop of House Democrats, with its large number of female, minority and younger members.\n\nThe agreement also ends what's been a distracting, harsh leadership fight among Democrats that has been waged since Election Day, when they gained at least 39 seats and grabbed House control for the next Congress. It was their biggest gain of House seats since the 1974 post-Watergate election.\n\nDemocrats have been hoping to train public attention on their 2019 agenda focusing on health care, jobs and wages, and building infrastructure projects. They also envision investigations of Trump, his 2016 presidential campaign and his administration.\n\nTo line up support, Pelosi initially resorted to full-court lobbying by congressional allies, outside Democratic luminaries, and liberal and labor organizations. She cut deals with individual lawmakers for committee assignments and roles leading legislative efforts.\n\nBut in the end, she had to make concessions about her tenure to make sure she'll win a majority \u2014 likely 218 votes \u2014 when the new House votes. Democrats are likely to have 235 seats, meaning she could spare only 17 defections and still prevail if, as expected, Republicans all oppose her.\n\nPelosi had described herself as a transitional leader over the last several weeks. But she'd resisted defining how long she would serve as speaker, saying it would lessen her negotiating leverage to declare herself a lame duck.\n\nOn Wednesday, she gave in to her opponents' demands that she limit her service. Under the deal, House Democrats will vote by February 15 to change party rules to limit their top three leaders to no more than four two-year terms, including time they've already spent in those jobs.\n\n\"I am comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not,\" Pelosi said in her statement.\n\nPelosi's opponents have argued it was time for younger leaders to command the party. They also said her demonization as an out-of-touch radical in tens of millions of dollars' worth of Republican television ads was costing Democrats seats.\n\nWhile some Democrats are still certain to vote against Pelosi \u2014 especially incoming freshmen who promised to do so during their campaigns \u2014 most Democrats have remained solidly behind her. She's been a strong fundraiser and unrelenting liberal who doesn't shy from political combat, and her backers complained that her opponents were mostly white men who were largely more moderate than most House Democrats.\n\nPressure to back Pelosi seemed to grow after she calmly went toe-to-toe with Trump at a nationally televised verbal brawl in the Oval Office on Tuesday over his demands for congressional approval of $5 billion for his proposed border wall with Mexico.\n\n\"We are proud that our agreement will make lasting institutional change that will strengthen our caucus and will help develop the next generation of Democratic leaders,\" the rebellious lawmakers said in a written statement.\n\nTo be nominated to a fourth term under the agreement, Pelosi would need to garner a two-thirds majority of House Democrats. Several aides said they believed restlessness by younger members to move up in leadership would make that difficult for her to achieve.\n\nThe limits would also apply to Pelosi's top lieutenants, No. 2 leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and No. 3 leader James Clyburn of South Carolina. Both are also in their late 70s.\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., was among 16 Democrats who had signed a letter demanding new leadership but who ultimately helped negotiate the deal with Pelosi.\n\nJoining Perlmutter in saying they would now back her were Democratic Reps.

Detailed negotiations on future recovery arrangements have not even begun.\n\nThe slower pace appears linked to the more talked-about stalemate over North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons .\n\nAt a June meeting with President Donald Trump, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un committed to \u201cwork toward\u201d the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to cooperate in recovering U.S. war remains. Neither issue is said to be explicitly dependent on the other, and in August, the North turned over 55 boxes of remains, with expectations of more to come soon. But progress then slowed, as has the nuclear diplomacy.\n\nTrump has said he likely will have a second summit with Kim in January or February, and while the nuclear issue would be the central focus, some believe a second meeting is the best chance to restore momentum to the remains recovery effort.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to wonder if that isn\u2019t what everyone is waiting on to happen,\u201d said Richard Downes, executive director of the Coalition of Families of Korean War and Cold War POW/MIAs, which advocates for a full accounting of the missing.\n\nThe remains of thousands of U.S. service members were left behind in North Korea when the war ended in 1953, with the North and South separated by a demilitarized zone and no formal end to the conflict. Joint U.S.-North Korean recovery operations started in 1996 and were halted in 2005 amid rising worries about the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions. More than 150 individuals have been identified from the remains that were jointly excavated and returned through 2005; those are separate from the remains in the 55 boxes, which had been stored by the North, probably for decades.\n\nOf the remains repatriated in August in the 55 boxes, two have been positively identified. They are Army Master Sgt. Charles H. McDaniel, of Butler, Missouri, and Vernon, Indiana, and Army Pfc. William H. Jones, of Nash County, North Carolina.\n\nCharles H. McDaniel, Jr., who was 3 years old when his father went missing in November 1950, says the unexpected return of his father\u2019s remains has given him a new perspective on life. After having buried the remains in late October in Greenwood, Indiana, McDaniel says he sometimes finds himself gazing alternately at a photo of his 4-year-old granddaughter and a picture of his father in uniform - a reminder that family connections live on.\n\n\u201cI almost feel he\u2019s looking at me,\u201d McDaniel said in a telephone interview.\n\nMcDaniel describes himself as hopeful that more remains will be sent home from North Korea, but he is not optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue for the world is the missiles and the bombs,\u201d he said, referring to concern that a nuclear-armed North Korea will pose an unacceptable threat to the world. \u201cWhen it\u2019s to their benefit they will let loose with something like the 55 boxes (of U.S. remains) to make them look good,\u201d without resolving the nuclear issue.\n\nKelly McKeague, head of the Pentagon agency responsible for worldwide efforts to account for U.S. servicemembers, said in September that he hoped to begin face-to-face negotiations with North Korea by the end of October on terms for resuming recovery missions in spring 2019.\n\nMcKeague\u2019s agency has detailed knowledge of locations of U.S. remains at former POW camps and elsewhere in North Korea, as well as sites around the country where U.S. airmen went down and were not recovered. But to travel to these locations and undertake excavations, the U.S. needs North Korea\u2019s cooperation. In the past, this has meant providing millions of dollars\u2019 worth of vehicles and fuel and other forms of support.\n\nA McKeague spokesman, Charles Prichard, said Wednesday that no formal negotiations have begun. He said McKeague believes that \u201cin the foreseeable future\u201d North Korean Army officers and members of his agency will meet to determine the location and date for negotiations on \u201cthe finer details\u201d of future recovery operations. An initial North Korean written proposal last summer was rejected by the U.S. as including unreasonable demands.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it is still feasible that joint recovery missions could be planned and executed in the spring of 2019,\u201d Prichard said. He said the two sides have exchanged letters and documents, but he could not reveal details.\n\nLast summer, Vice President Mike Pence publicly raised hopes for a complete accounting of Korean War remains in the North. Speaking in Hawaii, where he greeted the aircraft that delivered the 55 boxes from North Korea on Aug. 1, Pence spoke of a \u201cnew season of hope\u201d for the families of servicemen missing from the 1950-53 war.\n\nPence asserted that Trump had secured from Kim a promise \u201cto return the remains of all fallen U.S. service members lost in North Korea,\u201d although Pentagon officials so far have made limited progress in that direction. Of the nearly 7,700 service members listed as missing from the war, about 5,300 are believed to be in North Korea.\n\nSome worry that the Pentagon\u2019s inability thus far to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table may be connected to recently tightened U.S. restrictions on American private aid workers traveling to North Korea.\n\nDaniel Jasper, who has worked in North Korea for the American Friends Service Committee, which works with farmers in North Korea to improve food production, said in an email exchange this week that the limitations have confused the North Koreans. He said the State Department has cut back on exemptions to a U.S. ban on travel to North Korea. This has limited U.S.-based aid groups\u2019 work there and inhibited the flow of humanitarian help.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions on humanitarian activities have, no doubt, sent mixed signals to the North Koreans,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cWe are worried these restrictions may have ripple effects in other areas of relations, including the repatriation operations.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Trump Welcoming Governors-elect to White House", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-welcoming-governors-elect-to-white-house/4699308.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump is welcoming governors-elect from both parties to the White House.\n\nAmong those attending Thursday are Florida Republican Ron DeSantis, Georgia Republican Brian Kemp, Illinois Democrat J.B.

At least four of those journalists faced false news charges in what Quintal called \"a huge, huge setback.\"\n\n\n\nOverall, more than two dozen journalists have been charged with publishing false news, mainly in Africa.\n\nAccusations and imprisonments can propel self-censorship, with profound effects on citizens' right to information.\n\n\n\n\"When you see your colleagues being jailed, when you see them accused of so-called fake news, when they're being arrested on false news charges,\" Quintal said, \"it does, obviously, have a chilling effect.\"\n\n\n\nQuintal herself was targeted, along with colleague Muthoki Mumo, in Tanzania last month.\n\nDespite having an invitation letter from the Media Council of Tanzania, the two, both former journalists, were detained and interrogated.\n\n\n\nQuintal, from South Africa, and Mumo, from Kenya, were kept in custody for five hours.\n\n\n\n\"We were lucky because we were able to leave Tanzania,\" Quintal said, contrasting her experience to journalists in the country who have gone missing or continue to face intimidation.\n\n\n\n\"The abusive nature of what happened to us showed the world the true nature of what is going on in Tanzania at the moment,\" she added.\n\n\n\nQuintal and Mumo's case was unusual. Governments tend to target their own citizens, and journalists imprisoned by their governments make up 98 percent of cases, CPJ concluded. They also found that 13 percent of journalists in jail are women, an 8 percent increase from 2017.\n\n\n\nDespite worrying signs, there is room for optimism, Quintal said.\n\n\n\nWhen new leaders come to power, she said, human rights and press freedoms can improve very quickly.\n\n\n\nQuintal pointed to The Gambia as one example, where the new president, Adama Barrow, has created space for journalists to work without fear of reprisal.\n\n\n\nTuesday, Time magazine selected journalists who have been targeted for doing their work, the \"guardians\" of truth, as their Person of the Year."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Welcoming Governors-elect to White House", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-welcoming-governors-elect-to-white-house/4699308.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump is welcoming governors-elect from both parties to the White House.\n\nAmong those attending Thursday are Florida Republican Ron DeSantis, Georgia Republican Brian Kemp, Illinois Democrat J.B.

As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!\"\n\nCohen was sentenced Wednesday after telling a federal judge that his \"blind loyalty\" to Trump led him to \"cover up his dirty deeds.\"\n\nTrump, in his tweets, did not address Cohen's claim, nor what New York prosecutors say was then-candidate Trump's involvement in making a $150,000 payment to McDougal through American Media Inc.\n\nKill order\n\n\n\nThe company is the owner of the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which bought McDougal's story of her alleged 2006-2007 affair with Trump with the express purpose of then killing it so it would not surface before Election Day in November 2016, to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House.\n\nAmerican Media reached a deal with prosecutors to avoid prosecution and cooperate with them in disclosing its role with Trump in making the payment to McDougal.\n\nAs part of its agreement with prosecutors, AMI agreed to fully cooperate with authorities, including making officers and employees available for testimony and pledging to turn over any documents or other evidence as requested.\n\nLegal analysts said the developments could strengthen a potential case against Trump himself if prosecutors were to pursue one, although Justice Department guidelines say that a sitting president cannot be charged criminally until he leaves office.\n\nCohen is the closest figure to Trump sentenced to prison in the wide-ranging investigations of Trump's 2016 campaign, its possible links to Russia and whether, as president, Trump obstructed justice by trying to thwart the probes being conducted by federal prosecutors in New York and special counsel Robert Mueller in Washington.\n\nSeveral other prominent Trump figures, including his former campaign chairman and his first national security adviser, have yet to be sentenced for various offenses.\n\nU.S. Judge William Pauley told the 52-year-old Cohen that somewhere along the way, he had \"lost his moral compass.\"\n\n'Blind loyalty'\n\nCohen once bragged that he would \"take a bullet\" to support Trump. More recently, however, Cohen had turned against Trump and said at his sentencing that working for Trump was a \"personal and mental incarceration.\"\n\nProsecutors said that Cohen, at Trump's direction, facilitated the payments \u2014 in violation of campaign finance laws \u2014 to Daniels and McDougal shortly before the 2016 election to buy their silence about alleged liaisons with Trump a decade before he ran for the presidency.\n\nThe prosecutors said American Media knew corporations such as itself were subject to campaign finance laws that forbid payments \"made for purposes of influencing an election and in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or campaign,\" and that it did not report the payment to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nCampaign finance laws require campaign contributions to be disclosed and bar individual donations of more than $2,700.\n\nMueller investigation\n\n\n\nCohen attorney Lanny Davis said that after Mueller completes his investigation, Cohen would cooperate with congressional committees as they consider possible wrongdoing by Trump and his aides. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives have called for Trump's impeachment when they assume control of the chamber next month.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's repeated lies cannot contradict stubborn facts,\" Davis said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "As Protectors Abandon Trump, Investigation Draws Closer", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/as-protectors-abandon-trump-investigation-draws-closer/4699111.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:28", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump has now been abandoned by two of his most powerful protectors, his longtime lawyer and the company that owns the National Enquirer tabloid, bringing a perilous investigation into his campaign one step closer to the Oval Office.\n\nBoth Michael Cohen and American Media Inc. now say they made hush money payments to a porn star and a Playboy Playmate for the purposes of helping his 2016 White House bid, a campaign finance violation. The women alleged affairs with Trump, and federal prosecutors say the payments were made at Trump\u2019s direction.\n\nThe admissions by Cohen and AMI conflict with Trump\u2019s own evolving explanations. Since the spring, Trump has gone from denying knowledge of any payments to saying they would have been private transactions that weren\u2019t illegal.\n\nOn Twitter Thursday, Trump contended he \u201cnever directed\u201d his former personal lawyer to break the law. He tweeted that Cohen \u201cwas a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law.\u201d\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges \u201cin order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence,\u201d Trump tweeted. He said the charges were \u201cunrelated to me.\u201d\n\nThough prosecutors have implicated Trump in a crime, they haven\u2019t directly accused him of one, and it\u2019s not clear that they could bring charges against a sitting president even if they want to because of Justice Department protocol.\n\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s changing explanations have clouded the public understanding of what occurred and are running head-on into facts agreed to by prosecutors, AMI and Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes and was sentenced on Wednesday .\n\n\u201cYou now have a second defendant or group of defendants saying that these payments were made for the primary purpose of influencing the election, and that it was done in coordination with Trump and his campaign,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTrump\u2019s first explanation of the payment that would eventually help lead Cohen to a three-year prison sentence came at 35,000 feet over West Virginia.\n\nReturning to Washington on Air Force One, Trump on April 6 for the first time answered questions about the reports of $130,000 in hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, issuing a blanket denial to reporters while saying they would \u201chave to ask Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\nThree days later, the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s office, seizing records on topics including the payment to Daniels. Furious, Trump called the raid a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said the FBI \u201cbroke into\u201d his lawyer\u2019s office. He also tweeted that \u201cAttorney-client privilege is dead!\u201d\n\nThe raid was overseen by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan and arose from a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference. At the time, Cohen said he took out a personal line of credit on his home to pay Daniels days before the 2016 election without Trump\u2019s knowledge.\n\nLater that month in a free-wheeling \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview, Trump acknowledged that Cohen represented him in the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal.\u201d\n\nIn May, Trump and his attorneys began saying Cohen received a monthly retainer from which he made payments for nondisclosure agreements like the one with Daniels. In a series of tweets, Trump said those agreements are \u201cvery common among celebrities and people of wealth\u201d and \u201cthis was a private agreement.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the investigation say Cohen secretly recorded Trump discussing a potential payment for former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal two months before the election. On the tape, Cohen is heard saying that he needed to start a company \u201cfor the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\u201d a possible reference to David Pecker, Trump\u2019s friend and president of AMI.\n\nWhen Cohen began to discuss financing, Trump interrupted him and asked, \u201cWhat financing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay,\u201d Cohen responded.\n\nProsecutors announced Wednesday that AMI acknowledged making one of those payments \u201cin concert\u201d with the Trump campaign to protect him from a story that could have hurt his candidacy. The company avoided prosecution under a deal with prosecutors.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other charges, saying he and Trump arranged the payment of hush money to Daniels and McDougal to influence the election. That next day, Trump argued that making the payments wasn\u2019t a crime and that the matter was a civil dispute, then took a swipe at his former employee.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don\u2019t retain the services of Michael Cohen!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump compared his situation to one involving President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. The Federal Election Commission, which typically handles smaller campaign finance violations, where the actions aren\u2019t willful, with civil penalties that are typically fines, docked the Obama campaign $375,000 for regulatory civil violations. The fines stemmed from the campaign\u2019s failure to report a batch of contributions, totaling nearly $1.9 million, on time in the final days of the campaign.\n\nBut legal analysts said the accusations against Trump could amount to a felony because they revolve around an alleged conspiracy to conceal payments from campaign contribution reports - and from voters. It\u2019s unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime.\n\nThe Justice Department, in opinions issued by its Office of Legal Counsel, has said a sitting president cannot be indicted because a criminal case would interfere with the duties of the commander in chief. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, and with Mueller\u2019s office, would presumably be bound by that legal guidance unless the Justice Department were to nullify the opinions.\n\nPolitically, Trump\u2019s shifting claims could harm his credibility with voters, but legally they may not make much of a difference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that he\u2019s made any false statements in legal documents that could open him to liability for perjury,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nFor the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction, prosecutors would need to show that Trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed Cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign.\n\nTrump has not yet laid out a detailed defense, though he could conceivably argue that the payments were made not for the purposes of advancing his campaign but rather to prevent sex stories from emerging that would be personally humiliating to him and harm his marriage.\n\nThat argument was advanced by former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, in a similar campaign finance case that went to trial. But that may be tougher for Trump than it was for Edwards given the proximity of the president\u2019s payment to the election \u2014 timing that, on its face, suggests a link between the money and his political ambitions.\n\nStill, the cases aren\u2019t always easy, as proven by the 2012 trial of Edwards. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one charge of accepting illegal campaign contributions, but couldn\u2019t reach a verdict on the five remaining counts including conspiracy and making false statements. Prosecutors elected not to retry Edwards, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004 and a candidate for president in 2004 and 2008."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US to Reorient Trade Deals, Aid to Africa", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-reorient-trade-deals-aid-to-africa/4699029.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The Trump administration has unveiled a new strategy toward Africa, saying that U.S. interests and priorities must come first in all dealings with the continent.\n\nU.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton outlined at the new strategy in Washington Thursday.\n\nHe said trade and commercial ties must benefit both the U.S. and African countries.

Tunisia leads the northern Africa region in women\u2019s rights and government representation, but at least 47 percent of the country\u2019s women are affected by domestic violence. Law 58, which took effect in February, offered sweeping protections from physical, economic and psychological abuse, and even outlawed harassment in public.\n\nBut nongovernmental organizations, government officials and survivors of domestic violence who met late last month to assess how the law is being implemented reported a host of shortcomings, from logistical barriers that prevent some women from filing complaints to social pressures that keep others from even trying.\n\nOne woman told the conference of the trouble she faced when filing a report against her husband for assault and economic exploitation. She said police at a local station sent her to a district office so she could file the complaint with a specialized unit, but authorities there turned her away. She eventually managed to take her case to court, but said she was disappointed when the judge only fined her husband 300 dinar, or roughly $100.\n\nThe story illustrates some of the common problems women in Tunisia have been facing as they seek protection under a law that seemed perfect on paper.\n\n\n\nHurdles To Reporting\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to reporting crimes under the new law is the lack of agents trained to handle them, conference participants said.\n\nNabiha Gaddechi, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said 264 agents have completed training and hundreds more are in the pipeline. But the new units specializing in violence against women are still short-staffed, causing hiccups in the report-filing process.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS The Tunisian Parliament in October 2017.\n\nWomen who head to their local police station to file domestic violence reports are often sent to district offices, which tend to be located in less accessible areas, Gaddechi said. Once there, she added, victims often aren\u2019t offered a private space to file their reports and must do so in the open, sometimes among criminal suspects awaiting processing. Women also can\u2019t file reports at night, which is when most incidents of violence occur. Gaddechi attributed these problems to a lack of staff.\n\nConference participants said there are also many social norms that may lead people to tolerate or even justify violence against women.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs is monitoring whether religious messages are interfering with the application of the law, according to spokesman Slim Bencheikh. However, some agents have abused their power and pressured women against taking their spouses to court, Gaddechi said. She pointed out that this is a clear violation of the law, which states that \u201cany agent who is a part of the specialized unit for investigations into violent offenses against women and who voluntarily exerts pressure, or any sort of coercion, on victims for the purpose of making them give up their rights, change their complaint, or retract it will be punished by one to six (6) months in prison.\u201d\n\nTrouble In The Courts\n\nWomen continue to face challenges, even if they successfully file a report.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many specialized courts equipped to handle cases related to violence against women, said Raoudha Garafi, a court magistrate. Others noted how hard it is for some women to afford a lawyer.\n\nSana Ben Achour, the president of Association Beity, which runs women\u2019s shelters, said there were many reasons to consider punishing offenders in ways that don\u2019t include prison sentences. For one thing, conference participants pointed out, some women end up dropping charges against their husbands because they\u2019re afraid of being left as the only caretaker in their home.\n\nBen Achour said there were also problems with prisons.\n\n\u201cPrison has a positive, deterrent effect when it comes to fighting impunity, but it is also a problem because Tunisian prisons fail to have the corrective role they are supposed to,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the contrary, prisoners come out of them even more hateful.\u201d\n\nSome Good News\n\nDespite the hurdles, some progress has been made in the last year. The Ministry of Women, Family, Childhood, and Seniors set up shelters and listening centers for survivors of domestic violence around the country. A hospital in Tunis has also been equipped with new technology that makes it easier for medical staff to detect evidence of domestic abuse.\n\nParticipants at the meeting drafted recommendations for authorities and vowed to work together to improve the landmark law.\n\nIn the meantime, women\u2019s rights groups are also turning their attention to two new pieces of legislation that parliament is expected to vote on in coming weeks: an amendment that would make Tunisia the first country in the region to offer women equal inheritance to men, and a bill that would extend maternity and paternity leave for parents."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Myanmar Debates Women\u2019s Rights Amid Evidence Of Pervasive Sexual And Domestic Violence", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myanmar-womens-rights-violence_us_5c113be9e4b03a134dc1c8f8", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "By Stephanie Miedema and Tharaphi Than\n\nFor years, feminists in Myanmar have been fighting to gain even the most basic legal rights for women.\n\nSpousal abuse is still legal in the isolated country formerly known as Burma. Even criminal sexual assault is rarely punished.\n\nActivists\u2019 patient efforts to change that are starting to pay off.\n\nIn late November, officials announced that the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act, long stalled in parliament, may finally be passed in 2019. The bill would protect women from domestic violence, marital rape, sexual violence and workplace harassment, and provide legal and medical support to survivors.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge victory for the pioneering women\u2019s rights groups that helped draft the legislation first proposed in 2013.\n\nBut as revealed in our on-the-ground research on violence against women and gender inequality in Myanmar, the law is not the only thing that needs changing to keep its women safe.\n\nIntimate partner violence is common\n\nAcross the globe, violence against women \u2013 whether physical, sexual or psychological \u2014 is most likely to be perpetrated by their husband or boyfriend.\n\nThirty percent of women worldwide will be abused by a male partner during their lifetime, and the proportion is as high as 68 percent in some countries.\n\nData on intimate partner violence in Myanmar \u2014 which is run by a semi-authoritarian, military-heavy regime \u2014 is slim. But in 2016 the U.S.-funded Demographic and Health Survey, which is conducted in some 100 countries every five years, found that 21 percent of women there reported experiencing physical, sexual or psychological violence at the hands of an intimate partner, particularly slapping, pushing, choking and attacks with weapons.\n\nThe real percentage is likely much higher. Surveys on intimate partner violence typically produce lower-than-actual numbers, in part because many women don\u2019t feel comfortable or safe talking about assault.\n\nAccording to Legal Clinic Myanmar, a charity based in Yangon, 68 percent of the cases they attended in May 2018 concerned gender-based violence.\n\nEvidence also shows that women are more likely to experience violence in countries with high gender inequality. Myanmar ranks 106 of 189 countries in the U.N. Gender Inequality Index.\n\nAP Photo/Altaf Qadri A Rohingya refugee who fled Myanmar. She has convinced her husband to let their eldest daughter study.\n\nOur research sheds light on a high-profile U.N. report released in August, which documented widespread rape and sexual slavery in Myanmar\u2019s genocidal campaign against the Muslim Rohingya people.\n\nThe findings were disturbing. But, for us, they were not surprising. Violence against women is a silent emergency in all Myanmar.\n\nA false belief in gender equality\n\nUnequal gender relations in Myanmar stem from \u201chpon,\u201d a deeply held social belief that considers men to be holy, glorious and spiritually superior. Women are associated with ill omens and bad luck.\n\nHpon translates into both subtle and overt segregation by gender in Myanmar.\n\nPolitics is almost exclusively the domain of men, with women making up around 10 percent of national and state legislatures. In contrast, the male-dominated Myanmar military is guaranteed 25 percent of seats in all governing bodies.\n\nAP Photo/Thein Zaw Buddhism and the military are Myanmar\u2019s two biggest institutions. Both are male dominated.\n\nWomen in this Buddhist-majority country are not allowed to access certain religious spaces. Their garments are washed separately, so as not to contaminate men\u2019s clothing.\n\nThough hpon devalues women, we have found in interviews that people in Myanmar think that men and women enjoy equal status.\n\nThey point to women and men\u2019s relatively equal education levels, for example, or observe that women get to keep their last names after marriage. Women in Myanmar can also travel freely without a male escort, giving them relative independence compared to women in neighboring South Asian countries.\n\nPositive views of gender equality in Myanmar also celebrate a few very high-achieving women \u2014 most of them from upper-class backgrounds.\n\nThese exceptional figures include Queen Shin Saw Pu, who reigned the Mon Kingdom from 1453 to 1472, the 20th-century education campaigner Daw Mya Sein and leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 2015.\n\nDamir Sagolj/Pool Photo via AP Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi (left, with Chinese President Xi Jinping) is often cited as an example that women have equal opportunity in Myanmar.\n\nBlaming the victim\n\nBut the success of a few is not the same as equality for all.\n\nThe misperception of gender equality in Myanmar can actually make life harder for women who are seen to fall short of these high ideals, we found, because they feel like deviants in an otherwise equal and peaceful society.\n\nAfter a Myanmar model sued her boyfriend for rape in September 2018 \u2014 a very rare legal challenge in Myanmar \u2014 she was viciously attacked on social media, where she was called a \u201cprostitute\u201d and a \u201cwoman of low morals.\u201d She received hate mail suggesting she was better off dead.\n\nThe social stigma against sexual abuse and harassment in Myanmar society means most abuse survivors never report their experiences.\n\nMany women we interviewed have kept silent about domestic violence because they believe friends and family would say it was their \u201cwifely duty\u201d to be patient and quiet.\n\nOthers feared retaliation if they made their abuse known.\n\nGender inequality in Myanmar also limits women\u2019s ability to leave abusive relationships. Many women are financially and socially dependent on their partners, and would face social isolation, stigma and financial insecurity if they fled.\n\nMale-dominated institutions\n\nSince men dominate Myanmar\u2019s political, legal and criminal justice institutions, women also fear that reporting domestic violence will not protect them.\n\nOnly 1 percent of women who seek help after physical or sexual violence go to the police, according to the Demographic and Health Survey.\n\nWhen they do, they are not often believed.\n\nOne woman we spoke with said that she reported her violent husband to law enforcement, only to have her case dismissed. She said her husband paid the local police to ignore her.\n\nMyanmar society also typically turns a blind eye toward sexual abuse by soldiers and Buddhist monks, members of the country\u2019s two most powerful institutions.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s fitful transition from dictatorship toward democracy in recent years is giving women the opportunity, for the first time in history, to fight for their legal rights.\n\nIf the Prevention and Protection of Violence Against Women Act is passed next year, it will not fix the entrenched gender inequality that makes Myanmar women vulnerable to sexual violence.\n\nBut it is a critical step in the right direction.\n\nStephanie Miedema is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Emory University.

Also on the hackers\u2019 hit list: high-profile defenders, detractors and enforcers of the nuclear deal struck between Washington and Tehran, as well as Arab atomic scientists, Iranian civil society figures and D.C. think tank employees.\n\n\u201cPresumably, some of this is about figuring out what is going on with sanctions,\u201d said Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written about Iranian cyberespionage and was among those targeted.\n\nKagan said he was alarmed by the targeting of foreign nuclear experts.\n\n\u201cThis is a little more worrisome than I would have expected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hit list surfaced after Charming Kitten mistakenly left one of its servers open to the internet last month. Researchers at Certfa found the server and extracted a list of 77 Gmail and Yahoo addresses targeted by the hackers that they handed to the AP for further analysis. Although those addresses likely represent only a fraction of the hackers\u2019 overall effort \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear how many of the accounts were successfully compromised \u2014 they still provide considerable insight into Tehran\u2019s espionage priorities.\n\n\u201cThe targets are very specific,\u201d Certfa researcher Nariman Gharib said.\n\nAP Photo/Raphael Satter Certfa researchers Nariman Gharib, left, and Amin Sabeti, shown at a cafe in London on Dec. 7, 2018. Certfa helped uncover the Charming Kitten campaign.\n\nIn a report published Thursday, Cerfta tied the hackers to the Iranian government, a judgment drawn in part on operational blunders, including a couple of cases where the hackers appeared to have accidentally revealed that they were operating from computers inside Iran. The assessment was backed by others who have tracked Charming Kitten. Allison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks, recognized some of the digital infrastructure in Certfa\u2019s report and said the hackers\u2019 past operations left little doubt they were government-backed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear-cut,\u201d she said.\n\nCalls to Iranian officials were not returned late Wednesday, the beginning of the weekend in the country.\n\nIran has previously denied responsibility for hacking operations, but an AP analysis of its targets suggests that Charming Kitten is working in close alignment with the Islamic Republic\u2019s interests. The most striking among them were the nuclear officials \u2014 a scientist working on a civilian nuclear project for the Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Defense, a senior operator at the Research and Training Reactor in the Jordanian city of Ramtha, and a high-ranking researcher at the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.\n\nThe trio suggested a general interest in nuclear technology and administration. Others on the hit list \u2014 such as Guy Roberts, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs \u2014 pointed to an eagerness to keep track of officials charged with overseeing America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been worried about,\u201d Roberts said when alerted to his presence on the list.\n\nStill more targets are connected to the Iran deal \u2014 a 2015 pact negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and other world powers that called for Tehran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump tore up the deal in May over the objections of most of America\u2019s allies and has re-imposed a series of punishing restrictions on Iran since.\n\nOne of Charming Kitten\u2019s targets was Andrew J. Grotto, whose tenure on the U.S. National Security Council straddled the Obama and Trump administrations and who has written about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nJarrett Blanc, the State Department coordinator responsible for the implementation of the nuclear deal under Obama, was also on the list. He said news of his targeting was no shock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve retained contact with Iranian counterparts since leaving government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if there were not Iranian groups trying to hack into my various email accounts.\u201d\n\nLike the Russian hackers who have chased after America\u2019s drone, space and submarine secrets, the list indicates that Iranian spies were also interested in the world of U.S. defense companies. One of those targeted is a senior director of \u201cbreakthrough technology\u201d at the aerospace arm of Honeywell International Inc., the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate; another is a vice president at Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp., a prominent Pentagon contractor.\n\nHoneywell said it was aware that one of its employees had their personal account \u201cexposed,\u201d adding that there was no evidence that the company\u2019s network was compromised. SAIC said it found no trace of any hacking attempt against its employee\u2019s account.\n\nThere were Iranian targets too, including media workers, an agronomist and a senior employee of the country\u2019s Department of Environment \u2014 a possible sign that Tehran\u2019s crackdown on environmentalists, which began earlier this year, continues apace.\n\nHacking has long been a feature of the tense relationship between the United States and Iran, whose militant brand of Shia Islam has challenged American interests in the Middle East since 1979.\n\nIt was against Iran that U.S. and Israeli spies are said to have deployed the pioneering, centrifuge-rattling computer worm dubbed Stuxnet in a bid to sabotage the country\u2019s uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian hackers in turn are blamed for denial of service assaults on American banks and computer-wrecking cyberattacks in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s regional archrival.\n\nThe Charming Kitten campaign uncovered by Certfa is far less sophisticated, generally relying on a password-stealing technique called phishing. Two Nov. 17 emails provided to the AP by Jim Sisco of Enodo Global Inc., a Virginia-based risk advisory firm that was targeted by Charming Kitten, mimic the look and feel of Gmail security alerts, a technique used by hackers across the globe.\n\nAn analysis of Certfa\u2019s data shows the group targeted at least 13 U.S. Treasury employees\u2019 personal emails, including one belonging to a director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which fights money laundering and terror financing, and one used by the Iran licensing chief at the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is in charge of enforcing U.S. sanctions.

He said the cases are being handled separately by local bureaus of the national intelligence agency in Beijing, where Kovrig was picked up, and the northeastern city of Dandong, where Spavor had been living.\n\n\u201cThe legal rights of the two Canadians are being safeguarded,\u201d Lu told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe two cases ratchet up pressure on Canada, which is holding Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies. She was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 but released on bail. The U.S. has requested her extradition to face charges of bank fraud.\n\nCanadian officials have not been able to contact Spavor \u201csince he let us know he was being questioned by Chinese authorities,\u201d Canadian Global Affairs spokesman Guillaume B\u00e9rub\u00e9 said Wednesday. \u201cWe are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts and we continue to raise this with the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nKovrig is an analyst on northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, who took a leave of absence from the Canadian government and is based in Hong Kong.\n\nSpavor runs tours of North Korea along with sports, business and other exchanges through his company, Paektu Cultural Exchange. He has ties to figures in the North\u2019s government, including leader Kim Jong Un and was instrumental in bringing NBA player Dennis Rodman to the North\u2019s capital Pyongyang in 2013.\n\nAcquaintances said he was due in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Monday, but never showed up.\n\nThe detentions echo that of another Canadian, Keven Garratt, who spent 750 days in detention in 2014-16 and was given an eight-year prison sentence for espionage before being deported. Garratt\u2019s detention was seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada\u2019s arrest of Chinese spy who was eventually extradited to the U.S.\n\nThe broadly defined national security charge encompasses both traditional espionage and other forms of information gathering such as interviewing dissidents and contacting non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe root of the dispute appears to be Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng while she was changing planes at Vancouver airport. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nChina earlier warned of dire consequences if Meng wasn\u2019t released and the editor in chief of the Global Times, a Communist Party-run tabloid known for its provocative views, warned in a video Wednesday night of \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d if Canada doesn\u2019t free Meng.\n\n\u201cIf Canada extradites Meng to the U.S., China\u2019s revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian,\u201d Hu Xijin said, speaking in English.\n\nCanada has asked China for extra security at its embassy because of protests and anti-Canadian sentiment and has advised foreign service staff to take precautions, a senior Canadian official told reporters.\n\nThe United States and China have emphasized that China-U.S. trade talks are separate from the case against Meng, though President Donald Trump obliterated the distinction Tuesday, saying he\u2019d intervene if it would help produce a trade agreement with China.\n\n\u201cIf I think it\u2019s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made \u2014 which is a very important thing \u2014 what\u2019s good for national security \u2014 I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe suggestion that Meng could be a political pawn in negotiations makes the situation more awkward for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bristled at Trump\u2019s assertion, saying: \u201cRegardless of what goes on in other countries, Canada is, and will always remain, a country of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland said it was \u201cquite obvious\u201d any foreign country requesting extradition should ensure \u201cthe process is not politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Canadian and American officials have emphasized that the Meng arrest is separate from the trade talks,\u201d said Gregory Yaeger, special counsel at the Stroock law firm and a former Justice Department trial attorney.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s remarks could be interpreted as creating the appearance that the arrest also had political motivations. This could undermine the U.S.\u2018s reputation as a country that follows the \u2018rule of law,\u2019 and could ultimately undermine both the Meng prosecution and the trade talks.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier drew fire for intervening on behalf of Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, after it was accused of selling equipment to Iran and North Korea.\n\nU.S. regulators planned to bar it from receiving U.S. components that it depended on, effectively a corporate death sentence. But Trump issued a reprieve, perhaps partly because U.S. tech companies, major suppliers to ZTE, would also have been scorched. ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, change its board and management, and let American regulators monitor its operations.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urged reporters not to jump to the conclusion that Trump will actually intervene in Meng\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what he actually decides,\u201d Ross said. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we go from there.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Theresa May Wins Vote Of Confidence In Her Tory Leadership And Stays As UK Prime Minister", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theresa-may-wins-vote-of-confidence_us_5c1178c2e4b002a46c13d7e1", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:35", "body_paragraphs": "Theresa May has fought off a bid to topple her as prime minister, winning a Tory vote of confidence by 200 votes to 117.\n\nAfter a day of high drama at Westminster, May defeated the challenge to her authority \u2013 but only after making an emotional pledge that she would not lead her party into the next general election.\n\nLoyal MPs and cabinet ministers yelled their support when the result was announced by Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservatives party\u2019s 1922 committee in the House of Commons.\n\nUnder party rules, she cannot be challenged again for another year, ensuring she will still be in charge when the UK quits the EU in March 2019.\n\nThe margin of victory underscored the scale of Tory MPs\u2019 anger at her Brexit plans, seen as compromise on trade and other rights in an attempt to find an agreement with Brussels.\n\nMay will have to move quickly to heal the deep wounds caused by the confidence vote, which was triggered on Wednesday morning when 48 backbenchers demanded her popularity should be formally tested.\n\nShe still faces a formidable challenge to get her Brexit proposals passed through the House of Commons, with a chunk of Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) forming a powerful blocking minority.\n\nHaving lost her parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s snap election, May is propped up in power by the DUP\u2019s 10 MPs.\n\nBrexiteers told HuffPost UK she still faces the prospect of \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d to derail legislation needed to enact her EU exit plans.\n\nAnd one Cabinet minister said that the prospect of a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit was so severe that May may be forced to revoke Article 50, the formal process of leaving the 28-nation bloc.\n\nPress Association Backbench Tory chairman Sir Graham Brady\n\nShe now heads out to Brussels for an EU summit on Thursday, hoping to win some concessions to help her persuade her critics to approval her deal in a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d expected in the New Year.\n\nHer confidence vote victory came just three hours after she had made a final pitch to all 317 of her Tory MPs, in a packed committee room of the Commons.\n\nIn a bid to win as much support as possible, May signalled that she would never again lead her party into an election against Labour.\n\nSome MPs were in tears as she made the promise, but leading rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg said that he did not believe her, pointing out she had only said she \u201cintends\u201d not to contest the election.\n\nOthers said the PM had told the gathering that she had wanted to fight the 2022 election to make up for her disastrous performance in costing the party its majority in 2017, but realised MPs were \u2018not comfortable\u2019 with the idea.\n\nIn a further bid to win support, May also said she wanted a \u201clegally watertight solution\u201d to the vexed problem of the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 a guarantee to keep open the Irish border by linking the UK indefinitely to EU trade rules.\n\nOne cabinet minister said that the PM had tried to reassure MPs that she would not do anything to break faith with the DUP.\n\n\u201cShe made absolutely clear that to get a deal, to deliver a deal the only way of doing it is with the Democratic Unionist Party,\u201d he said.\n\nPossible leadership contenders Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and David Davis, as well as home secretary Sajid Javid and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, will now all have to bide their time for a future vacancy\n\nEarlier, Jeremy Corbyn lambasted May\u2019s postponement of a Commons vote on her Brexit deal at Prime Minister\u2019s Question Time.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has been working since 2015 to reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\n\nOn Thursday, Congress passed a bill reauthorizing a major federal juvenile justice crime bill for the first time in 16 years.\n\nAdvocates say the reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) is a huge victory, since its funding has drastically declined over the years and its provisions have become outdated, putting youth charged with crimes at risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only robust [federal] law we really have that protects kids,\u201d said Marcy Mistrett, the CEO of the Campaign for Youth Justice. \u201c[It\u2019s] a huge win.\u201d\n\nThe JJDPA has policies that fight racial inequity within the system, keep children out of adult jails and ensure they aren\u2019t detained for status offenses such as skipping school or possessing alcohol. New additions to the bill will strengthen these protections and add new requirements, such as mandating that states develop programs to address the high rates at which youth of color are arrested and detained.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to see our kids in detention facilities,\u201d said Naomi Smoot, the executive director at the Coalition For Juvenile Justice. \u201cThis is a critical time in our justice reform movement to have this bill passed.\u201d\n\nThe bill has policies that fight racial inequity within the system, keep children out of adult jails and ensure they aren\u2019t detained for status offenses such as skipping school or possessing alcohol.\n\nThe landmark piece of juvenile justice legislation, which was originally passed in 1974, hasn\u2019t been reauthorized since 2002 in large part due to partisan bickering. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has held up the bill\u2019s passage over the past few years by opposing a provision that would prevent children accused of status offenses from being detained if they had violated a previous court order.\n\nAs a result, protections for youth have been eroding. The JJDPA budget has declined by almost 50 percent in recent years, and over the past five years, the House has threatened to cut funding for JJDPA programs entirely, according to Smoot. Three states no longer implement the act\u2019s requirements because they are too costly.\n\nMistrett says juvenile justice bills aren\u2019t typically given the same weight as other policies, which has contributed to the delayed reauthorization.\n\n\u201cI think, at the end of the day, it just comes down to political priority and will,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople move [bills] that are sexier and that respond to constituents more than to kids.\u201d\n\nChild advocates point out that youth are often left out of criminal justice discussions: For example, the proposed federal crime reform bill, The First Step Act, includes just one provision for minors.\n\n\u201cOften, when we think about folks who have been incarcerated, we think of adults or high-profile cases that we see on TV,\u201d Smoot said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think about the fact that these are children and [that] they don\u2019t deserve to be in detention facilities.\u201d\n\nOver the past four years, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has made reauthorizing the JJDPA a priority before he steps down as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Over the past few weeks, he helped resolve a dispute between Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that was preventing unanimous consent on the legislation and began an expedited process to pass the bill through the Senate.\n\n\u201cKids in our juvenile justice system need safety, fairness and treatment that encourages respect for the law,\u201d Grassley said in a press release. \u201cThat\u2019s why this bill deserved to be passed.\u201d\n\nSmoot says it\u2019s especially crucial that the JJDPA was reauthorized this year, since the Trump administration has re-adopted the \u201csuperpredator\u201d mentality toward young people in the system \u2015 a term from the \u201990s that politicians used to stigmatize black youth.\n\nCaren Harp, the current head of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, has said the juvenile justice system focuses too much on \u201cavoiding arrests at all costs,\u201d and has cut back research on racial disparities.\n\nThe new provisions included in the JJDPA will, among other things, increase the requirements for collecting racial data and keep kids who are charged as adults out of jail. It will also ensure that juvenile justice programs at the state level focus on prevention rather than punishment and reflect the latest brain science research on youth.\n\nNow that the reauthorization bill has passed Congress, it needs to be signed by President Donald Trump to officially become law.\n\nAdvocates say they will fight for further amendments to the JJDPA in the new year, but for now, they are celebrating a hard-fought win."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Trump Impersonator Gives Impromptu Interview That's As Bonkers As The Real Thing", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-impersonator-anthony-atamanuik-impromptu-press-conference_us_5c1255b7e4b0835fe3272d8b", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "Donald Trump impersonator Anthony Atamanuik gave a hilarious impromptu interview as the president on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cLate Night.\u201d\n\nThe comedian, who portrayed POTUS on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe President Show,\u201d dodged host Seth Meyers\u2019 questions in trademark Trump style by going off on wild tangents and telling far-fetched tales.\n\nAtamanuik also explained how Trump\u2019s voice has evolved over the decades and revealed the \u201cthree modes\u201d he uses to mimic his tone."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Green New Deal Gains Key Support At Home As Trump Undercuts UN Climate Talks Abroad", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-democratic-support_us_5c117be8e4b0449012f65edf", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "In February 2015, a top Republican lawmaker tossed a snowball on the Senate floor in a cringeworthy stunt meant to illustrate his scientifically unfounded skepticism of climate change.\n\nNearly four years later, the White House is promoting the same brand of denialism and fealty to the fossil fuel industry at the United Nations\u2019 climate conference in Poland. But in Washington the snowball metaphor might more accurately describe how a markedly different brand of climate politics is gaining support.\n\nIn barely a month, talk of a so-called Green New Deal \u2015 a sweeping climate policy to simultaneously transition away from oil, gas and coal and ease widening income equality \u2015 stormed from the fringes of policy debates into the political mainstream.\n\nBy Wednesday, the burgeoning effort to establish a select committee in the House of Representatives on a Green New Deal \u2015 essentially a plan to make a plan \u2015 picked up its strongest endorsements yet, netting support from the co-chairs of the 78-member Congressional Progressive Caucus and from the first labor union to back the proposal. At least 35 incoming or sitting House members support the resolution, as do four senators.\n\nThe proposal, championed by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), came as grassroots groups like the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats organized protests at the Capitol, with young activists occupying Democratic leaders\u2019 offices and urging lawmakers to pledge their support. Nearly 150 people were arrested Monday in the groups\u2019 largest demonstration yet.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we give special attention to climate change should be a no-brainer,\u201d Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), a Progressive Caucus co-chair, said by phone Wednesday.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Activists with the Sunrise Movement, a grassroots youth-focused climate justice group, repeatedly occupied Democratic leaders' offices over the past month to demand a Green New Deal.\n\nThe resolution faced skepticism from the top Democrats on natural resources and energy committees that wield legislative power over the issues a Green New Deal would cover. But proponents tweaked language in the proposal this week to mandate the select committee to lay out a vision for a Green New Deal while maintaining existing committees\u2019 authority over the lawmaking process.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even call it compromises. It was more specificities,\u201d Pocan said. \u201cIt was really getting at making it specific and workable. We wanted to make it so it could be an executable idea.\u201d\n\nThe resolution calls for barring lawmakers who have accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry from serving on the select committee. Maintaining legislative power for existing committees with members who might have taken contributions from oil, gas and coal donors could pose some risk but would be worth it, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the other Progressive Caucus co-chair.\n\n\u201cThe harm that\u2019s done in taking legislative authority away from the committees is far too great,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is ready. There are a lot of champions in the rooms that we need them to be in who will be controlling the agenda.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to anti-corruption legislation she introduced last month as a possible tool to keep lawmakers from sabotaging eventual Green New Deal legislation at the behest of powerful donors.\n\n\u201cActivists across the country will keep up the pressure to make sure every member is responding with the urgency that\u2019s necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nThe unusually speedy sausagemaking process inverts decades of Democrats\u2019 dithering on the rapidly worsening crisis caused by greenhouse gas pollution. That mirrors the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive efforts to unwind the few, relatively weak climate regulations that exist and to upend fragile negotiations at the 24th Conference of the Parties in Katowice, Poland, where diplomats this week are struggling to garner support for basic resolutions recognizing the scientific consensus on global warming.\n\nThe summit follows an October report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found that world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years to avert warming of 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels, beyond which climate change is forecast to be cataclysmic. The Trump administration announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, but that won\u2019t legally go into effect until 2020. In the meantime, the administration has worked hard to further undercut the talks. The United States teamed up with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to weaken a resolution to endorse the report \u2014 something the State Department outright refused to do.\n\nThe Democratic Party needs an answer for what their plan is to match ... the IPCC report on climate. Young people and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are providing a solution to that dilemma. Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats\n\nYet a congressionally mandated federal report last month, using research from 13 agencies, reached similar conclusions and found that the United States is already suffering the effects of sea level rise and extreme weather.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party needs an answer for what their plan is to match the U.N.\u2019s recommendations in the IPCC report on climate,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group that played a leading role in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s winning primary campaign. \u201cYoung people and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are providing a solution to that dilemma.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the only issue for which the Green New Deal would provide a fix. The Democratic Party has long been dogged by tensions between environmentalists clamoring for action on climate change and labor leaders warning against policies that ostracize the fossil fuel industry, which provides high-paid construction jobs.

Since the spring, Trump has gone from denying knowledge of any payments to saying they would have been private transactions that weren\u2019t illegal.\n\nThough prosecutors have implicated Trump in a crime, they haven\u2019t directly accused him of one, and it\u2019s not clear that they could bring charges against a sitting president even if they want to because of Justice Department protocol.\n\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s changing explanations have clouded the public understanding of what occurred and are running head-on into facts agreed to by prosecutors, AMI and Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes and was sentenced on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYou now have a second defendant or group of defendants saying that these payments were made for the primary purpose of influencing the election, and that it was done in coordination with Trump and his campaign,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nTrump\u2019s first explanation of the payment that would eventually help lead Cohen to a three-year prison sentence came at 35,000 feet over West Virginia.\n\nReturning to Washington on Air Force One, Trump on April 6 for the first time answered questions about the reports of $130,000 in hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, issuing a blanket denial to reporters while saying they would \u201chave to ask Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\nThree days later, the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s office, seizing records on topics including the payment to Daniels. Furious, Trump called the raid a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said the FBI \u201cbroke into\u201d his lawyer\u2019s office. He also tweeted that \u201cAttorney-client privilege is dead!\u201d\n\nThe raid was overseen by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan and arose from a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference. At the time, Cohen said he took out a personal line of credit on his home to pay Daniels days before the 2016 election without Trump\u2019s knowledge.\n\nLater that month in a free-wheeling \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview, Trump acknowledged that Cohen represented him in the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal.\u201d\n\nIn May, Trump and his attorneys began saying Cohen received a monthly retainer from which he made payments for nondisclosure agreements like the one with Daniels. In a series of tweets, Trump said those agreements are \u201cvery common among celebrities and people of wealth\u201d and \u201cthis was a private agreement.\u201d\n\nPeople familiar with the investigation say Cohen secretly recorded Trump discussing a potential payment for former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal two months before the election. On the tape, Cohen is heard saying that he needed to start a company \u201cfor the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\u201d a possible reference to David Pecker, Trump\u2019s friend and president of AMI.\n\nWhen Cohen began to discuss financing, Trump interrupted him and asked, \u201cWhat financing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay,\u201d Cohen responded.\n\nProsecutors announced Wednesday that AMI acknowledged making one of those payments \u201cin concert\u201d with the Trump campaign to protect him from a story that could have hurt his candidacy. The company avoided prosecution under a deal with prosecutors.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other charges, saying he and Trump arranged the payment of hush money to Daniels and McDougal to influence the election. That next day, Trump argued that making the payments wasn\u2019t a crime and that the matter was a civil dispute, then took a swipe at his former employee.\n\n\u201cIf anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don\u2019t retain the services of Michael Cohen!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump compared his situation to one involving President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. The Federal Election Commission, which typically handles smaller campaign finance violations, where the actions aren\u2019t willful, with civil penalties that are typically fines, docked the Obama campaign $375,000 for regulatory civil violations. The fines stemmed from the campaign\u2019s failure to report a batch of contributions, totaling nearly $1.9 million, on time in the final days of the campaign.\n\nBut legal analysts said the accusations against Trump could amount to a felony because they revolve around an alleged conspiracy to conceal payments from campaign contribution reports - and from voters. It\u2019s unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime.\n\nThe Justice Department, in opinions issued by its Office of Legal Counsel, has said a sitting president cannot be indicted because a criminal case would interfere with the duties of the commander in chief. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, and with Mueller\u2019s office, would presumably be bound by that legal guidance unless the Justice Department were to nullify the opinions.\n\nPolitically, Trump\u2019s shifting claims could harm his credibility with voters, but legally they may not make much of a difference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that he\u2019s made any false statements in legal documents that could open him to liability for perjury,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nFor the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction, prosecutors would need to show that Trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed Cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign.\n\nTrump has not yet laid out a detailed defense, though he could conceivably argue that the payments were made not for the purposes of advancing his campaign but rather to prevent sex stories from emerging that would be personally humiliating to him and harm his marriage.\n\nThat argument was advanced by former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, in a similar campaign finance case that went to trial. But that may be tougher for Trump than it was for Edwards given the proximity of the president\u2019s payment to the election \u2014 timing that, on its face, suggests a link between the money and his political ambitions.\n\nStill, the cases aren\u2019t always easy, as proven by the 2012 trial of Edwards. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one charge of accepting illegal campaign contributions, but couldn\u2019t reach a verdict on the five remaining counts including conspiracy and making false statements. Prosecutors elected not to retry Edwards, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004 and a candidate for president in 2004 and 2008.\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics/feed", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Expertly Dismisses Kellyanne Conway Insult", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-kellyanne-conway_us_5c1207dbe4b002a46c14140f", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "How about... no.\n\n\n\nSometimes political media is too fixated on personalities instead of policies.\n\n\n\nThe whole country JUST went through an exhausting midterm election.

Work. Cook. Vacuum. Watch Netflix. Drive the kids to soccer practice.\n\nI need something \u2014 something different. So when I hear from a friend that there is a women\u2019s football team in our city, I jump at the chance to join.\n\nSure, I\u2019ve never played football before, and I\u2019ve rarely watched it. Truth be told, I don\u2019t actually understand the sport. But I can\u2019t help but feel it might fill some holes in my life. \u201cMe\u201d time. Exercise. Fun with other grown-ups. All things that tend to be in short supply when you have three young kids.\n\nSometimes, when I watch my kids play softball, ride their bikes super fast or practice handstands in the living room, I think, When did I stop doing that? I tell myself I can still be athletic. After all, I played sports in high school (cough, cough) 20 years ago. How hard can it be?\n\nIt turns out \u2014 pretty hard!\n\nThe local women\u2019s football team, I learn, operates as a fundraiser for youth sports in the community. Proceeds from ticket sales, admissions and fundraisers go toward sports equipment, scholarships for low-income kids and other expenses. These women play football, the website says, \u201cin the spirit of fun, inspiration, and community support for youth sports.\u201d\n\nThough the team is billed as a local \u201cmoms\u201d team, not everyone is a mom \u2014 in fact, the youngest player just graduated from high school, and the oldest is in her 50s. Several neighboring communities have similar teams, and every year they play one another. Some of the rivalries are fierce, from what my friend says.\n\n\n\nI have no idea what to expect, and I\u2019m uncharacteristically nervous before the first practice. At first, I only tell a couple of friends, whose opinions are mixed \u2014 \u201cWhoa, you could get badly hurt!\u201d one exclaims, while another proclaims me \u201cbadass.\u201d My husband seems impressed; my kids think I\u2019m joking.\n\n\u201cYou are not exactly the type to tackle someone,\u201d my 8-year-old says matter-of-factly. Thanks, kid.\n\nThe team\u2019s email updates instruct us to prep for the season by exercising, eating right and drinking lots of water. Good idea, I think. But, as is often the case, I lose momentum and don\u2019t really do any of it. I start to feel sick every time I think about football. I worry I\u2019ve made a mistake.\n\nI knew I was out of shape, but the first \u201cspeed and agility\u201d practices are even tougher than I\u2019d imagined. Under the watchful eyes of our five(!) coaches, I \u2015 and a couple dozen women, only one of whom I know \u2015 jog around the field and catch footballs and jump over hurdles. We high-step over a rope ladder and attempt a complicated shuffling drill they call \u201ckaraoke.\u201d\n\nBut the worst part, the absolute worst, are the \u201cduck-walks\u201d where we squat down low, stick our arms straight out and waddle down the field. My thighs are burning after a few waddles \u2015 and I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything adorably duckling-like about it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is exhausting,\u201d I say to another player during a water break.\n\nShe smiles knowingly. \u201cJust wait until the season really starts.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right. A few weeks later, at the first official practice, we\u2019re issued huge protective pads and helmets. The pads are bulky and hard to get on, and they make me feel like I\u2019m wearing a Tin Man costume. The helmet pinches my head, causing a pounding headache. I can\u2019t stop gagging on my rubbery mouthguard and keep spitting it out.\n\nCourtesy of Kim Hildenbrand After a long practice, nothing feels better than taking off the helmet, pads and muddy cleats.\n\n\u201cMouthguard in!\u201d the coaches holler. The drills feel five times harder than they were before.\n\nI\u2019m so tired that night, I fall asleep on the couch after dinner.\n\n\n\nThen the season begins in earnest. We practice twice a week: Wednesdays for two hours and Sundays for up to three hours.\n\nThe team has a hierarchy of skill, I quickly realize. There\u2019s a talented quarterback and several women (some young enough to be my kids) who can catch balls and run fast and tackle skillfully and just generally have it all together.\n\nI am not one of them. I huff my way around the field, noticing several other players casually chatting while they run. The first time I attempt to tackle a blocking dummy, I miscalculate, slide across it and end up sprawled in the grass, mud caked on my yoga pants.\n\nMy wobbly throws don\u2019t get the ball where I intend. I can catch OK \u2014 but after a football hits my finger wrong, it swells so badly that it takes two weeks of daily attempts (plus generous amounts of canola oil) to slide off my wedding ring.\n\nI feel pretty hopeless.\n\nWe soon get our position assignments. I\u2019m on the line for offense and defense. Sure, there\u2019s a lot I can\u2019t do, but I can push people pretty hard. Huh. Who knew?\n\nDuring lineman drills, we shove the heavy sled across the grass. We hurl ourselves at the tackling dummy. We pair off and learn how to tackle each other. I fight the urge to apologize every time I knock someone down.\n\nThe morning after each practice, practically every muscle burns \u2026 I limp down the stairs, feeling every minute of my 39 years. I ask my youngest son to please stop grabbing my arms, which are covered in bruises, some shaped like handprints.\n\nCourtesy of Kim Hildenbrand Being on the line, you definitely get bruises. I got some strange looks when I wore short sleeves in public.\n\nWe\u2019re issued a huge playbook, and it might as well be in a different language. I study it every chance I get and try to soak up everything the coaches say. Blitzes. Iso. Gaps. Whiffing. Alleys. Shit \u2026\n\nBut I figure out pretty quickly the one chance I have of doing this thing right: I show up at every practice, and I work. I work hard. Slowly, things start to click.\n\n\n\nMy mouthguard stops making me gag. My helmet stops hurting. My bulky pads feel comfortable. I start jogging in my neighborhood wearing all three (can you imagine what my neighbors must think?).\n\n\n\nOne practice, after eating a big lunch, I have to run out to the parking lot, grab a plastic bag out of my car, spit out my mouthguard and throw up. Five minutes later, I\u2019m back to duck-walking, trying to pretend it never happened. From then on, I eat lightly on practice days.\n\nAs the weeks pass, though I am still out of shape, I stop feeling like I\u2019ll die when I run or duck-walk or do pushups. In fact, I have more energy than I\u2019ve had in years.\n\nI get my specific positions: left tackle on offense, right tackle on defense. I know where to stand. I learn how to get low. Never low enough for the line coach (\u201cHildenbrand, get lower,\u201d he growls regularly), but better.\n\nI keep studying the playbook. The little letters and solid lines and dotted lines start to make sense. I can run-block or pass-block, left or right. It\u2019s not actually that complicated. I decide I might not fail spectacularly.\n\nOne day, I look around the field and realize I know everyone\u2019s name. Most of all, I gravitate toward three other rookies: Lindy (a wide receiver and linebacker), Courtney (a fullback) and Liz (our center). It starts with conversations before and after practice. Then comes a play date with all our kids. Walks around the track. Margarita night. Dinners. Birthday celebrations. A never-ending group text thread. We tell one another things we\u2019ve never told anyone. It\u2019s hard to believe these women were ever strangers.\n\nOur coaches, too, are no longer strangers. They aren\u2019t just football encyclopedias who tell us which play to run \u2015 they\u2019re also smart and funny and kind, and they give countless hours of their time, unpaid, because they love the sport.\n\nWe practice twice a week, religiously. We practice on Mother\u2019s Day. We practice no matter the weather.\n\nOne particularly rainy day, I\u2019m slogging across the muddy field, chasing someone who\u2019s much faster than I am, and something goes wrong. I feel a pop in my calf.\n\n\n\nA muscle cramp, I think. But a week later, after icing and limping around, I find out it\u2019s a torn muscle. I take a few weeks off and watch our practices instead of participating. I don\u2019t want to miss a game.\n\n\n\nThough our season is three months long, we play just three games. \u201cWe need the recovery time in between,\u201d our line coach explains.\n\nThe games are like nothing I\u2019d ever imagined. The first time I step on the field in uniform, everything happens in slow motion. I hear myself breathing around my mouthguard. Our quarterback is yelling plays I know but I don\u2019t know, all at the same time.\n\nThat first game is hard. I slam into strangers, which is actually more enjoyable than slamming into my teammates. I shove down a player on the other team and she yells at me. Instead of apologizing, I yell back. Who am I?\n\nWe win, and it feels amazing. I\u2019m still struggling to remove my pads when I get a text from my husband that says, \u201cThat was INCREDIBLE You really did it!\u201d My closest non-football friend meets me outside the locker room, wraps me in a huge hug and tells me she\u2019s never seen my husband or my kids so excited and proud.\n\nCourtesy of Kim Hildenbrand My family was very supportive of my football adventure.\n\nThat night, my kids can\u2019t stop talking about the game. \u201cYou really tackled someone, Mommy!\u201d my 8-year-old says, in apparent awe. \u201cIt was so cool ... she fell and everything!\u201d\n\nBut happy as I am, there\u2019s no denying my hand hurts after the game. I remember hitting someone\u2019s helmet by accident. Our team doctor X-rays it and says my wrist is cracked. It\u2019s not bad, though. I wear a splint during practices.\n\n\n\nWe lose our second game. That team is big, strong and young. We just can\u2019t pull it off.\n\n\n\nOur third and final game, though, is incredible. My kids, my husband, my closest friends are in the stands cheering, as excited as I\u2019ve ever seen them. My kids wave the signs they painted that morning; my 5-year-old\u2019s sign features a colorful drawing of \u201cmommy pushing someone.\u201d We end up winning in double overtime against our biggest rivals after our kicker makes a field goal.\n\n\n\nAfter the game, our fans, families and friends run onto the field. There\u2019s hugging and screaming and so many selfies. It feels like a movie \u2014 but it\u2019s better, because it\u2019s real.\n\nPeople ask all the time why I play tackle football. Why at my age? Why with the risk of getting hurt? Why not stop after cracking a wrist and tearing a muscle? Answers roll easily off my tongue: But it\u2019s so much fun. It\u2019s such great exercise. It\u2019s a great way to make new friends.\n\nThis is all true. But it\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nThe bigger picture is that when I fasten my pads, pull on jersey No. 39 and snap on my helmet, something magical happens.\n\nThe past 20 years of working and cooking dinner and paying bills and driving a minivan briefly fall away. I am not just mom or wife or writer: I am the 11-year-old who loves to strike people out in softball. I am the 15-year-old who can sink a free throw even while the other team\u2019s fans boo loudly. I am the 17-year-old soccer goalie who isn\u2019t scared to dive for the ball.\n\nCourtesy of Kim Hildenbrand We were so excited after winning our first game. I'm so grateful for my teammates!\n\nBut really, I am the mom who can do 20 pushups in a row. I am the wife who can sack a quarterback in a game. I am the writer who can memorize a dozen plays. I am the 39-year-old woman who feels stronger than I\u2019ve felt in years.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing I know: I will never forget how it feels to stand on a dark football field, aching and shivering, with a shiny trophy and a team full of amazing women whom I am proud to call friends and plan to keep in touch with for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd another thing I know: I can\u2019t wait until next season."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "What People Get Wrong About Suicides On Tribal Lands", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/native-american-tribal-suicides-mental-health_us_5c11218ce4b084b082fedbc2", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Native American communities experience a much higher rate of mental health issues, such as substance abuse and suicide, than any other racial or ethnic group in the country \u2015 and the media tend to fixate on these grim figures.\n\nData shows that tribal communities experience psychological distress 1.5 times more often than the general population, and Native Americans use and abuse alcohol and drugs at younger ages and at higher rates than any other ethnic group. Plus, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among 10- to 34-year-olds in tribal communities.\n\nBut Doreen Bird, Ph.D., an expert on mental health issues in tribal communities, says numbers like these tell only part of the story.\n\nBird, who hails from the Kewa Pueblo of New Mexico, has devoted her career to researching mental and behavioral health among Native American communities. She notes that suicide rates can vary widely from tribe to tribe, and cautions against treating all Native peoples as a monolith.\n\n\u201cYou can get a very different picture among different tribal nations,\u201d Bird told HuffPost.\n\nBecause of the stigma surrounding suicide, the reported numbers can also sometimes be off. In tribal communities, there\u2019s a reluctance to speak about those who have died by suicide, as well as mistrust of outside researchers who examine issues related to suicide but aren\u2019t from within the tribal communities, she added. It can also be taboo to talk about those who have died, Bird explained.\n\nBird, a 48-year-old mom of six and grandmother of three, wants to change the way tribal communities\u2019 stories are told and hopes to change the conversation around some of the toughest challenges facing many Native populations around the country.\n\nShe says alcohol abuse in her own family motivated her to explore these issues from a public health perspective, which means balancing her tribal background with her academic training. From 2016 to 2018, Bird served as a Senior Tribal Prevention Specialist at the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, where she worked with 16 tribes across the United States to address suicide prevention. Recently, she obtained her doctorate in justice studies at the Arizona State University School of Social Transformation.\n\nHuffPost spoke with Bird to learn more about her work, and what she wishes others knew about mental health within Native American communities.\n\nDoreen Bird Doreen Bird.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest misconception about suicide in tribal communities?\n\nA lot of times, the media and journal articles highlight high rates of suicide. But even in my own state of New Mexico, there were different varying rates. One study found that the more acculturated tribes had higher suicide rates than the more traditional, less acculturated tribes. [Acculturated means tribes that are more accustomed to the Western way of life \u2014 having jobs, paying bills, etc.]\n\nBut the tribe that I come from [Kewa Pueblo] had zero suicides. Some tribal nations have very low suicides, while others have very high suicide rates. So when you really look into tribal-specific numbers, you can get a very different picture amongst different tribal nations.\n\nWhat\u2019s important for researchers to keep in mind when it comes to tribal suicide prevention?\n\nThere are many cultural considerations that may be unique to each tribe. Some tribal communities consider it taboo to talk about death while others are OK to talk about death and the deceased. It\u2019s also important to listen to the elders and youth because they have lived experience in their communities. As outsiders trying to make an impact, it behooves us to look at strengths and resilience that lie within each community.\n\nTell me how health and well-being is viewed within Native communities.\n\nWith that, I can put my tribal lens back on because that\u2019s different in academia. In academia and the scientific journal literature, Natives have the highest rate of diabetes, PTSD, suicide. There are statistics, which a lot of times are also underrepresented.\n\nBut when I look from my personal tribal perspective, the way it\u2019s viewed is that life is really hard, and we have our customs and ways of living to sustain our culture and our tribal communities. We have a lot of strength there, and for mental health we have a lot of cultural knowledge and resources to help cope with the stress of life.\n\nWhat are some of those coping mechanisms?\n\nFor me, prayer and spirituality is huge. I remember seeing my grandmothers pray every night, every day. I think that my prayers have actually manifested my Ph.D. for me because I want to help my community so badly. For me, it was trying to understand families who were afflicted by alcohol problems. I actually was praying about it, and I ended up studying psychology and public health.\n\nAnother thing we have is an extended family network, which is so helpful in coping with life. For example, when I moved home, I moved home with my mom, my brothers, my children, and then all the neighbors in my tribal community around me. That\u2019s a huge connection of family and friends that are there to support one another. Even for me to finish school, I couldn\u2019t have done it without my brothers staying home to watch my kids while I was out going to class or working. Extended family is huge for us.\n\nWhat are some impacts you\u2019ve witnessed of suicide prevention efforts?\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of positive effects in schools. One example is the American Indian Life Skills (AILS) program, which is a school-based life skills training program that aims to reduce high rates of adolescent suicidal behaviors in Native American communities. It incorporates traditional Native American culture healers into the curriculum, while teaching students about coping skills, signs of suicidal thinking, and how to help one another. In one tribe where this program was implemented, the suicide rate went down to zero.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced as a Native American researcher in Native communities?\n\nData is known as the \u201cD-word\u201d among some Native Americans. In my own community, I was asked to talk about suicide prevention. When I said the word \u201cdata,\u201d there was pushback. I had a tribal leader telling me, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get that data, because we don\u2019t count how many of our children we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nI totally have to respect that as a tribal member, that worldview. But as an epidemiologist, when we\u2019re trying to create interventions with guidance from data, that was just a very interesting clash of values.\n\nAs a Native American academic, I have to deal with balancing our tribal community\u2019s world and respecting that, as well as academia and science. And also just trying to see how to respectfully engage the two into the work that we do.\n\nWhat advice would you give a young Native American struggling with their mental health?\n\nI would say reach out to somebody, cause there\u2019s always somebody who cares about us. Sometimes we feel so alone or we isolate ourselves, but there\u2019s always someone there that really cares about us.\n\nIt really can save lives just by showing that you care. I like to tell people we can all be healers. You don\u2019t have to be a doctor or a medicine person. We can help heal each other by being kind or smiling at somebody."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Tennessee U.S. Rep-Elect Walks Back False Claim That Vaccines Lead To Autism", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-representative-mark-green-vaccines-autism_us_5c11578fe4b00e17a535abd7", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "The CDC announced in 2000 that it was removing the chemical from most childhood vaccines \u2015 a move that some doctors say may have given anti-vaccination groups a sense of legitimacy that wasn\u2019t actually founded in medical fact.\n\nThe \u201crise in autism\u201d that Green referenced is also misleading.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

Weight training may not have the same effect, the study found, raising interesting questions about how various types of exercise affect us at a microscopic level and whether the differences should perhaps influence how we choose to move.\n\nThere is mounting and rousing evidence that being physically active affects how we age, with older people who exercise typically being healthier, more fit, better muscled and less likely to develop a variety of diseases and disabilities than their sedentary peers. But precisely how, at an interior, molecular level, exercise might be keeping us youthful has not been altogether clear. Past studies have shown that exercise alters the workings of many genes, as well as the immune system, muscle-repair mechanisms and many other systems within the body.\n\nSome researchers have speculated that the most pervasive anti-aging effects of exercise may occur at the tips of our chromosomes, which are capped with tiny bits of matter known as telomeres. Telomeres seem to protect our DNA from damage during cell division but, unfortunately, shorten and fray as a cell ages. At some point, they no longer safeguard our DNA, and the cell becomes frail and inactive or dies.\n\nMany scientists believe that telomere length is a useful measure of a cell\u2019s functional age.\n\nBut researchers also have found that telomeres are mutable. They can be lengthened or shortened by lifestyle, including exercise. A 2009 study, for instance, found that middle-aged competitive runners tended to have much longer telomeres than inactive people of the same age. Their telomeres were, in fact, almost as lengthy of those of healthy, young people. But that study was associational; it showed only that older people who ran also were people with extended telomeres, not that the exercise necessarily caused that desirable condition."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "MIND: Can We Really Inherit Trauma?", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/mind-epigenetics-genes.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-13 19:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "One working theory is based on animal research. In a series of recent studies, scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , led by Tracy Bale, have raised male mice in difficult environments, by periodically tilting their cages, or by leaving the lights on at night. This kind of upbringing, effectively a traumatic childhood, changes the subsequent behavior of those mice\u2019s genes in a way that alters how they manage surges of stress hormones.\n\nAnd that change, in turn, is strongly associated with alterations in how their offspring handle stress: namely, the young mice are numbed, or less reactive, to the hormones compared to control animals, said Dr. Bale, director of the university\u2019s Center for Epigenetic Research in Child Health and Brain Development. \u201cThese are clear, consistent findings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe field has advanced dramatically in just the past five years.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best explanation for how such trauma marks could be attached to a father\u2019s sperm cells comes from Oliver Rando at the University of Massachusetts. His studies, also in mice, have zeroed in on the epididymis, a tube near the testicles where sperm cells load before ejaculation. There, they learn to swim over a period of days, and their genes can be marked, said Dr. Rando.\n\nThe molecules that affect the changes appear to be \u201csmall RNAs,\u201d fragments of genetic material that scientists are still learning about, Dr. Rando said.\n\n\u201cThis tube produces small RNAs and ships them to the sperm as they develop, suggesting that there exists a place that senses the dad\u2019s environmental conditions and can change the package RNAs delivered through the sperm to the baby,\u201d Dr. Rando said. He makes no broad claims beyond that.\n\nOther researchers have attempted to fill out the picture. Once those RNA packages arrive at the epididymis, the hypothesis goes, they prompt a of cascade of changes at conception that evade the stripping, or rebooting, process and the subsequent reshuffling during early development.\n\nThe critics are far from persuaded. \u201cIt\u2019s all very nice work , and yes, there are changes in the testicular cells,\u201d said John M.

More than 100 scientific reports and surveys have studied screen habits and well-being in young people, looking for emotional and behavioral differences, as well as changes in attitude, such as in body image. In 2014, scientists from Queen\u2019s University Belfast reviewed 43 of the best designed such studies. The studies found that social networking allows people to broaden their circle of social contacts in ways that could be both good and bad, for instance by exposing young people to abusive content. The review\u2019s authors concluded that there was \u201can absence of robust causal research regarding the impact of social media on the mental well-being of young people.\u201d In short: results have been mixed, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nPsychologists have also examined whether playing violent video games is connected to aggressive behavior. More than 200 such studies have been carried out; some researchers found links, others have not. One challenge in studying this and other aspects of screen time is identifying the direction of causality: Do children who play a lot of violent video games become more aggressive as a result, or were they drawn to such content because they were more aggressive from the start?\n\nEven if scientists found strong evidence of a single, measurable effect \u2014 if, say, three hours of daily screen time was associated with a heightened risk of being diagnosed with A.D.H.D. \u2014 such a clear association wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest there were any consistent, measurable differences in brain structure.\n\nIndividual variation is the rule in brain development. The size of specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, the rate at which those regions edit and consolidate their networks, and the variations in these parameters from person to person make it very difficult to interpret findings. To address such obstacles, scientists need huge numbers of research subjects and a far better understanding of the brain.\n\nIsn\u2019t that what the N.I.H. study aims to address?\n\nYes. The ongoing A.B.C.D. study expects to follow 11,800 children through adolescence, with annual magnetic resonance imaging, to see if changes in the brain are linked to behavior or health. The study began in 2013, recruiting 21 academic research centers, and initially focused on the effects of drug and alcohol use on the adolescent brain. Since then, the project has expanded, and now includes other targets such as the effects of brain injury, screen time, genetics, and an array of \u201cother environmental factors.\u201d"}]
