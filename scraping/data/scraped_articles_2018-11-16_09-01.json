Some questions were \"unnecessary\" and others were \"possible traps\" or might be irrelevant, he said.\n\nGiuliani's striking complaint about a perjury trap appears to raise the question of why he might be worried about such an issue -- if the President were simply to tell the truth, in answers that will be scrubbed by his legal advisers.\n\nThe questions resulted from a tortuous negotiation between Trump's lawyers and the White House over the President's testimony. They only relate to the collusion part of the investigation and do not concern allegations that the President obstructed justice in the firing of former FBI Chief James Comey.\n\nTrump's huddles with his lawyers coincided with intense activity around the Mueller investigation, which largely went quiet in the days leading up to the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nThe comings and goings have left Washington on tenterhooks amid mounting speculation that significant action by the special counsel could be imminent.\n\nIn the past, the President's tirades about Mueller have sometimes coincided with developments in the special counsel probe.\n\nThere are expectations that Mueller, who has not unveiled any indictments since July, could be preparing more. CNN has reported that he has also started writing a final report on his investigation.\n\nNew questions\n\nThe President's fury sparked questions over whether he has any advance knowledge of any indictments Mueller may be preparing, or has gleaned other insight about the case from his new acting-Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nMuch of Mueller's work is taking place behind closed doors, but the evident bustle suggests plenty of reasons for Trump's dark mood.\n\nThose events included a visit by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is facing jail time on tax and fraud charges, to the special counsel's office on Monday.\n\nAttorneys for Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who is cooperating with Mueller after his own conviction, were seen at Mueller's office this week.\n\nJerome Corsi, an associate of former Trump political adviser Roger Stone said on Monday he expects to be indicted for giving false information to Mueller or the grand jury. Corsi later suggested in an interview with Reuters that he's in plea talks with Mueller's team.\n\nStone, who also appears to be in Mueller's sights, released text messages with an alleged Wikileaks back channel about \"big news\" about Hillary Clinton's campaign six days before the site released hacked emails.\n\nTrump's son, Donald Trump Jr. has reportedly told friends that he could he could be indicted, possibly over a meeting he and other Trump campaign officials held with a Russian lawyer promising \"dirt\" on Clinton.\n\nWith all that in mind, Trump's Thursday morning tweetstorm appears to reveal a President fuming with resentment about the probe and possibly deeply concerned about what it might reveal.\n\nMueller's questions likely offered Trump his most explicit sense yet as to where the investigation may be going and could perhaps offer him some hints about what witnesses have told Mueller. And the task of answering the questions, under the risk of perjury, may be a deeply unpleasant experience for him.\n\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,\" the President said, in a comment that could be interpreted as evidence that he has inside knowledge of the investigation.\n\n\"These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\" Trump wrote in one of his most furious attacks on Mueller.\n\nMueller was actually appointed to head the FBI in 2001 by President George W. Bush, and stayed for the rest of his administration and three years into President Barack Obama's term. Obama later extended his 10-year term for another two years.\n\n'A bad week'\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley defended Mueller and his team, adding \"if they are going to do something, I suspect it will be rather soon.\"\n\n\"Obviously, the President had a bad week and he doesn't like these questions, so he is lashing out because he is afraid to take responsibility, frankly for anything,\" Quigley said.\n\nThe President also revealed his anger about the Russia probe in an interview with The Daily Caller on Wednesday, which to some observers seemed like an tacit admission that he had appointed Whitaker after firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions in order to rein in the special counsel.\n\n\"Matthew Whitaker is a very respected man. He's -- and he's, very importantly, he's respected within DOJ,\" Trump told the conservative website.\n\n\"You know, look, as far as I'm concerned this is an investigation that should have never been brought. It should have never been had,\" he said. \"It's something that should have never been brought. It's an illegal investigation.\"\n\nDemocrats have warned that Whitaker, who is on record with fierce criticisms of the Mueller probe, and now oversees it, is nothing but a political henchman inserted into the top Justice Department job to rein in Mueller.\n\nHis appointment has added fresh urgency to an effort on Capitol Hill to protect Mueller. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake warned he would not vote to advance judicial nominees unless a bill shielding the special counsel got a floor vote.\n\nSenate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on Wednesday on the measure, which would allow any decision by Trump to fire the special counsel to be challenged in court."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Anderson Cooper ponders why Trump is so angry", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/CyhjqHt4BKE/donald-trump-rage-anger-kth-anderson-cooper-ac-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The bad news is that the challenges and threats that are making his mood so dark are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe President is angry at his rebuke from voters in the midterm elections . The oppressive prospect of action by special counsel Robert Mueller hangs like an immovable cloud over his White House. Staff chaos in the West Wing is producing lurid palace intrigue stories in the media that the President hates\n\nAbroad, he feuds with allied world leaders, and he's been so effective in implementing his \"America First\" policy that he's the odd man out at summits.\n\nAnd things are unlikely to improve quickly. Many legal observers expect new indictments to come soon in the Mueller probe, potentially bringing the investigation closer to Trump's inner circle in its final stages. The President fulminated over the probe on Thursday morning, calling it on Twitter \"A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nDemocrats are prepping a barrage of investigations that will make life in his White House a misery -- from attempts to seize his tax returns and probe his business dealings to investigations into key policy areas like immigration.\n\n\"He's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is letting off steam where he can. He's feuding with a former friend, Emmanuel Macron, mocking the French President's approval rating (at 29%, it is lower than Trump's) and the French jobless rate of over 9%.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday, the President betrayed his disturbed equilibrium, claiming that voter fraud had cost Republicans key races\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump claimed, without evidence.\n\nNot the first President to feel this way\n\nTrump is not the first President to feel isolated, angry, rejected by voters or down in the dumps. Everyone who sits in the Oval Office feels that way sooner or later, though Trump's temperament is more volcanic than most.\n\nThe question for Trump is, what can he do -- other than a few restorative weekends on the golf course in Florida -- to improve his position ahead of a crucial period that will define opening chapters of his re-election campaign?\n\nOften when they are in trouble, Presidents engineer staff shakeups to bring in new ideas and energy. They go looking for wins in foreign policy, an area that pesky congressional foes can do little to disrupt.\n\nMore fundamentally, Trump could examine his entire political approach. While his strategy of division and tearing at cultural and racial divides helped him win the White House, it seemed to backfire in key House races. Failure to win back the suburbs could harm his hopes of winning a second term in 2020.\n\nIf Trump never gave another angry news conference or swore off explosive tweets, it's possible that his political situation -- and his 39% approval rating in the latest CNN poll -- would improve.\n\nAfter all he's kept many of his campaign promises. Unemployment is at its lowest point in half a century and economic growth is going gangbusters.\n\nAnd conservatives will thank Trump for decades for his two successful Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut the President is so identified with convention-tearing tactics that it's probably impossible for him to change his style. It's probably too late as well, since he's made no effort to broaden his support base since taking office.\n\nTrump's tempestuous personality and unwillingness to be constrained also likely mean that another remedy available to other Presidents -- a hotshot new staffer to shake up operations in the West Wing -- is unlikely to work.\n\nHis first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, failed to impose order on Trump and was soon out the door. His successor, John Kelly, who is rumored to be on his way out, was soon drowned out by chaos.\n\nThe idea that Trump will look at election results, have some kind of political conversion and become a kinder, gentler President is also unthinkable.\n\nHe almost never admits he's wrong and he's been looking for people to blame for the GOP loss in the House.\n\nFor instance, the President listed GOP candidates who refused to accept his support -- or what he called \"the embrace\" -- at a post-midterm election news conference.\n\nA boost on the horizon?\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? 02:21\n\nSo what about a win on the world stage to boost the President's spirits?\n\nThere's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. US Middle East policy is in uproar since it's anchored on Saudi Arabia, which is being ostracized over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nStill, a breakthrough in a joint US and British diplomatic bid to end the war in Yemen would not just boost Trump's political prospects, it also would be a significant victory for humanity.\n\nTrump's hopes of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have taken a dent, with Pyongyang angry at the lack of concessions by the US and new indications that it is pressing ahead with its missile program.\n\nLater this month, Trump will head to the G20 summit. Progress in defusing his trade war with China at his talks there with President Xi Jinping -- or even a ceasefire -- could be spun as a foreign policy victory.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet with Vladimir Putin at the summit in Argentina. But that's a potential political landmine, given allegations of Russian election interference that have produced unflattering media coverage of his chats with the Russian leader, which has infuriated the President.\n\nThe chances of significant wins at home also seem slim, given the gridlock that will descend on Washington when Democrats take the House gavel.\n\nBut Trump mused after the midterm elections that the new arrangements might be more conducive to deal-making than had a thin GOP majority materialized.\n\n\"This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't,\" he said.\n\nTrump seemed like someone trying to convince himself as much as the reporters in the room. But it's possible there is common ground on issues like prescription drug prices or infrastructure.\n\nThere was actually a ray of light on Wednesday when Trump had Democrats and Republicans to the White House to sign a bill that represents a small step toward criminal justice reform.\n\n\"Did I hear the word bipartisan?\" Trump quipped at the signing ceremony.\n\nOnce the Democratic subpoenas start flying, however, the room for compromise might shrivel.\n\nSo Trump will have one final option -- elevate an enemy -- a device he has effectively used throughout his political and business career.\n\nHe could choose to stage a showdown over a year-end spending bill to wring more financing for his border wall out of Congress. Though it's not clear that the possible government shutdown that could result would help him politically.\n\nThere is an argument that Trump will actually profit from lining up against a Democratic-led House next year -- especially if Nancy Pelosi, whose approval ratings are worse than his, gets her old job back as speaker.\n\nWhen 2019 dawns, a flurry of Democrats are likely to begin launching presidential campaigns, giving him an excuse to head out to the place where he always feels best: among his adoring throngs on the campaign trail."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Ken Starr on Trump's tweets: Please stop it", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/YHsgx6X3jTg/ken-starr-trump-mueller-attack-tweet-newday-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Former Solicitor General Ken Starr says President Trump's tweets on the Mueller investigation are not presidential and are not helping the US."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Judge delays decision in CNN lawsuit over Acosta's press pass", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Di_sz-JeChk/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "CNN is also asking for \"permanent relief,\" meaning a declaration from the judge that President Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass was unconstitutional.

Kelly is only expected to weigh in on the temporary status of Acosta's press pass.\n\nFurther hearings are likely to take place in the next few weeks, according to CNN's lawyers.\n\nThe White House took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access after he had a combative exchange with Trump at last week's post-midterms press conference. CNN sought a resolution for several days before filing suit on Tuesday.\n\nThe case was assigned to Kelly, a Trump appointee who has been on the federal bench just more than a year now. He was very inquisitive at Wednesday's hearing, asking tough questions of both sides, drilling particularly deep into some of CNN's arguments.\n\nAttorney Theodore Boutrous, representing CNN in court, called Trump's move to revoke Acosta's hard pass \"the definition of arbitrariness and capriciousness.\"\n\n\"What are the standards?\" Boutrous asked. \"Rudeness is not a standard. If it were, no one could have gone to the press conference.\"\n\nBoutrous also commented that Trump is \"the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room\" at press conferences.\n\nAfter Boutrous spoke, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that the Trump White House has the legal right to kick out any reporter at any time for any reason.\n\nBurnham, who's been tasked with defending Trump, was responding to a hypothetical from Kelly. Burnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's press pass if it didn't agree with their reporting. \"As a matter of law... yes,\" he said.\n\nBurnham's comment in court made the stakes of CNN v.

It was a routine as ingrained in him as brushing his teeth, and it nearly cost him his life.\n\nOn a morning in February 2014, Lau -- a senior editor at the popular, upmarket daily Ming Pao -- had parked his car on a street near the restaurant when two men, wearing motorcycle helmets and gloves, rushed up to him. One slashed at Lau with a meat cleaver, knocking him to the floor, where he lay bleeding with deep wounds in his back and legs as his assailants ran off.\n\nWith what a court later described as \"superhuman calm,\" Lau phoned for an ambulance, and was rushed to hospital. He survived, and two men with triad links -- Yip Kim-wah and Wong Chi-wah -- were arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm.\n\nWhile Yip and Wong were later jailed, they did not reveal who had commissioned and paid for the attack, one of several against journalists in Hong Kong at that time, including the firebombing of the home and office of Jimmy Lai, publisher of the Apple Daily, a tabloid highly critical of the Chinese government.\n\nIn the wake of the attack against Lau, several thousand journalists and supporters took to the streets , dressed in black and carrying banners which read \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in a defiant show of support for press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nIt was a tense period for journalists in Hong Kong. The sense of despair was lifted, temporarily, by the so-called Umbrella Revolution mass pro-democracy protests which broke out in late 2014. Those demonstrations saw the international media spotlight swing onto Hong Kong, and the local press rose to the challenge, covering every aspect of the protests and their fallout, and winning multiple awards in the process.\n\nIndeed, in the wake of the protests, reporters' assessment of press freedom in the city rose for the first time in years, according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA)\n\nBut just as the Umbrella protests eventually gave way to widespread disillusionment, as hoped for reforms never panned out, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures were jailed, recent weeks have seen a collapse in confidence among the city's small journalist community, and renewed fears of self-censorship, prosecution and violence.\n\nOn November 9 this year, the HKJA warned of the \"death knell of freedom of speech\" in the city.\n\nProtesters display placards during a rally to support press freedom in Hong Kong on March 2, 2014.\n\nKeeping quiet\n\nUnder Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, residents are guaranteed \"freedom of speech, of the press and of publication,\" rights that are not granted, or protected in mainland China.\n\nWhile this means there is little top-down control of media in Hong Kong, self-censorship within the local press has been widely reported, both by frontline reporters and editors who have left publications they felt were unwilling to stand up to the government or corporate pressure.\n\nOne of the best descriptions of self-censorship, and its pernicious power which sometimes outstrips that of more aggressive control, comes from China scholar Perry Link\n\n\"(The) government's censorial authority in recent times has resembled not so much a man-eating tiger or fire-snorting dragon as a giant anaconda coiled in an overhead chandelier,\" Link wrote about academic self-censorship in China.\n\n\"Normally the great snake doesn't move. It doesn't have to. It feels no need to be clear about its prohibitions. Its constant silent message is 'You yourself decide,' after which, more often than not, everyone in its shadow makes his or her large and small adjustments\u2014all quite 'naturally'.\"\n\nWhile mainland China has a massive formal censorship apparatus, controlling all aspects of society from movies and music, to the internet and book publishing, much of what effects people on a day to day level is closer to self-censorship. Social media firms, for example, employ hundreds of censors to police what their users say, but for the most part, they do so without guidance or direction from the central government, second guessing what their bosses, and by extension the Communist Party's official censors will disapprove of.\n\nIn this context, self-censorship becomes more effective the more unclear the boundaries, and the greater the repercussions for potentially stepping across them.\n\nThis could be seen in Hong Kong in the wake of the attack on Lau, as the chance of a violent response to a story suddenly seemed a real possibility to many reporters, compounding existing fears about the \"wrong\" story costing the journalist their job or resulting in costly legal proceedings.\n\nFor over a decade, however, even as warnings grew about self-censorship by Hong Kong reporters, and media ownership was consolidated by a few China-friendly businesspeople, the foreign press has largely operated unfettered, a stark contrast to China, where international reporters regularly harassed, ejected from the country, and their local colleagues arrested and jailed.\n\nThat all changed this year.\n\nPeople raise pro-China signs in a protest against Hong Kong independence in front of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong on August 14, 2018.\n\nAction reaction\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong is positioned half way up a hill on a busy, windy road with narrow pavements and multiple lanes in the city's Central district.\n\nIt's not a good venue to protest outside of, and yet, in August several dozen people squeezed themselves into police cordoned-off areas opposite and next to the club, bearing banners accusing the elite institution of being involved in a \"conspiracy to split Hong Kong from China.\"\n\nInside, the focus of the protests, Andy Chan, sat looking calm and composed as he prepared to give a speech arguing for the city's independence . He chatted casually with FCC staff, and laughed when fire department officials rushed into the building carrying axes in response to an apparent hoax call.\n\nWithin days of the event taking place, Chan's Hong Kong National Party was officially banned under public security laws, the first time they had ever been used to go after a political organization. The FCC itself, meanwhile, was facing a storm of publicity amid calls for it to lose the lease to its property and potentially even its license to operate.\n\nVictor Mallet, a Financial Times journalist and vice president of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) (right) speaks with Andy Chan, founder of the Hong Kong National Party, during a luncheon at the FCC in Hong Kong.\n\nBy October, those fears appeared misguided, until Victor Mallet, an editor at the Financial Times who had hosted Chan in his capacity as acting-FCC President, put in for a routine visa renewal.\n\nCompared to China and many other countries in the region (including ones which boast about being democracies), Hong Kong is an incredibly easy place to get a journalist visa, but Mallet had his refused , an almost unprecedented move the government has yet to explain but nearly everyone else has connected to the Chan talk.\n\nWhile the local government has consistently denied that Mallet's ejection was anything to do with press freedom, the failure to provide an alternate explanation, as well as the facts of the case, have left most to draw their own conclusions.\n\n\"We ... are deeply concerned that with this action, taken with no stated or apparent legal basis, Hong Kong's special place as a bastion of free expression and a free press has been eroded,\" 17 former presidents of the FCC wrote in an open letter to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after Mallet was denied entry to the city as a visitor on November 8\n\nJUST WATCHED China exports its model of internet sovereignty Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China exports its model of internet sovereignty 02:31\n\nNew normal\n\nWhile reporters working in mainland China are obviously subject to the pressures and concerns that can lead to self-censorship -- fear of violence, fear of being ejected from the country or even jailed -- there is an additional factor in Hong Kong, in that the city has long been a place where many expats, including foreign reporters, are more like immigrants, getting permanent residency and raising their children, rather than moving on after a few years.\n\nBeing ejected from a country one never had any intention of living in can, though most journalists would not admit it, be a boon to career prospects, significantly building the reporter's profile and reputation. But being forced to leave somewhere you intended to raise your family and settle down can be devastating, and questions naturally arise over whether any given story, or event, or interview, is worth that?\n\nRecent weeks have seen two incidents which appear from the outside to be clear cut cases of self-censorship.\n\nThe specter of the attack on Lau, as well as the 2015 disappearance of several Hong Kong booksellers , was raised on November 2, when the organizers of a show by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao canceled the event , a day before it was due to take place, alleging \"threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist.\"\n\nThis was followed by the cancellation of a talk by another Chinese exile, novelist Ma Jian, at Tai Kwun, an art space which has received government funding, as part of a series of events connected to the Hong Kong International Literary Festival.\n\nIn a statement, the Director of Tai Kwun, Timothy Calnin, said organizers \"do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.\"\n\n\"The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,\" said Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, a pro-free speech organization.\n\n\"It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity,\" added Ng.\n\nChinese author Ma Jian speaks to the press upon his arrival at Hong Kong International Airport on November 9, 2018.\n\nThe self-censorship charge appeared to be confirmed when Tai Kwun abruptly reversed its decision and agreed to host Ma after all.\n\n\"Ma has made public statements which clarify that his appearances in Hong Kong are as a novelist and that he has no intention to use Tai Kwun as a platform to promote his personal political interests,\" Calnin said in a statement.\n\nOver all of this -- Mallet's visa refusal, Badiucao's cancelled show, Andy Chan's banned party, and all the protests and demonstrations they inspired -- hangs a long delayed anti-sedition provision contained within the Basic Law, the city's de facto constitution.\n\nArticle 23 of Basic Law instructs the local government to \"enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government ... and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies.\"\n\nAttempts to implement the law in 2003 sparked massive street protests which eventually saw it shelved, but it has remained a priority of the central government and current leader Carrie Lam has vowed to create \"suitable conditions\" for passing the law, though she has not outlined any timetable.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government has shown it is not lacking in powers to go after protesters or dampen expression, Article 23 would massively expand the amount of forbidden topics in a city already nervous about its freedoms, and possibly even end its role as a hub for international media in Asia.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Tai Kwun event , Ma Jian said people nevertheless need to \"have the courage to break\" through self-censorship.\n\n\"The freedom to speak is the basis of our civilization,\" he added. \"We have to safeguard our freedom of expression. We have to safeguard our civilization.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Ikea's plan to fix pollution crisis in India", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/0b7rPRxOFMI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "New Delhi (CNN Business) Ikea has come up with a plan to help some of the world's most polluted cities breathe easier.\n\nThe global furniture giant will start making products out of agricultural waste in India, meaning farmers no longer have to burn it.\n\nThe initiative, called \"Better Air Now,\" will provide Indian farmers with a use for unwanted rice straw, which is often burned.

Officials have said it's hard to determine the number of missing, because some people may have evacuated and can't be reached with cell phone service unreliable due to the fire.\n\n\"There are a lot of people displaced and we're finding a lot of people don't know we are looking for them,\" Honea said.\n\nThe fire turned the hard-hit town of Paradise into ash and debris and also devastated the nearby communities of Magalia and Concow. Honea said three sets of remains were found Thursday in Paradise, three in Magalia and one in Concow.\n\nHonea has invited relatives of the missing to visit the sheriff's office in Oroville so authorities can collect DNA samples from them. The DNA will be used to help identify fire victims, Honea said.\n\n\"This is a daunting task. We feel really bad for the people who don't know what happened to their loved ones and our hearts go out to them,\" Butte County Sheriff's Investigations Sgt. Steve Collins said. \"We want to give them some answers.\"\n\nTroops, cadaver dogs and coroners involved\n\nThe somber search for the missing in Butte County is painstaking.\n\nIt involves 461 people and 22 cadaver dogs in Paradise, Magalia and Concow, authorities said.\n\nDozens of National Guard troops have joined the search effort, Collins said. Once they find the remains, with the help of forensic experts, the coroners are sent to recover them.\n\nTo enable searchers access to the destroyed structures, crews help move collapsed buildings and roofs out of the way.\n\nThe white overalls protect the rescue workers from ash and debris and help avoid contamination, Collins said.\n\n\"They are going to be searching vehicles that have been burned. They'll be searching residences that have been burned. Checking around the residences ... our mission is to find the victims from this fire, recover them and get them identified and notify the families to give them some answers.\"\n\nRoger Kelton, 67, wipes his tears while searching through the remains of his mother-in-law's home.\n\nThe search area is wide and spread out.\n\n\"It's not just the area; it's the number of homes, the number of trailers, the multistory buildings. All of that changes the complexity of this operation,\" Collins said.\n\nExperts are conducting targeted searches by first sending deputies to areas in which people have been reported missing. The number changes daily with more calls coming in.\n\n\"We're trying to follow up with those people who are calling in to find out if they've made any contact with their loved ones,\" Collins said. \"We're asking people to call us if they do come in contact with their loved one so that we don't spend time looking for somebody that's already found.\"\n\nHousing shortage\n\nFamilies who lost their homes in the fires are going to have a very hard time finding a place to live, Butte County Housing Authority Executive Director Ed Mayer said.\n\n\"We just had 10% of our county's housing stock erased in one day; it's hard to convey the significance of that,\" he said.\n\nA Walmart in Chico has a parking lot full of vehicles, including motor homes, in which people are living, often running the heat in their cars and trucks all night. Other people are staying in tents.\n\n\"It's been a week and people have been great, but I don't know how long it's going to last,\" Mayer said. \"Short-term, we are fine, but long-term we are not.\"\n\nOne of the selling points of Paradise was its affordable housing, but that's been erased, Mayer said.\n\n\"And there is nothing to replace it\" for low-income families, he said.\n\nSuspected outbreak of norovirus reported\n\nMore than 9,600 firefighters, including many from out of state, are battling wildfires across California.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which has destroyed about 9,700 homes and scorched 141,000 acres in Northern California, is one of several in the state. By Thursday, it was 40% contained.\n\nAdding to the misery for evacuees, officials reported a suspected outbreak of norovirus at a shelter in Chico. Evacuees showed some symptoms, but officials are waiting for test results for confirmation. The stomach bug causes vomiting, nausea and diarrhea.\n\nOther fires in the state\n\nIn Southern California, the Woolsey Fire -- which, like the Camp Fire, began November 8 -- has killed at least two people in Malibu. Authorities are trying to determine whether a third person found in a burned home in Agoura Hills died as a result of that fire, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has burned more than 98,000 acres and destroyed more than 500 structures . It is 62% contained. More favorable weather conditions for firefighters are in the forecast.\n\nMore than 230,000 acres burned in California in the past week. That's larger than the cities of Chicago and Boston combined. And in 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Many Camp Fire victims didn't get emergency alerts.

Please help us to be safe,\" she pleaded in the video.\n\nThough she managed to escape, she never did receive an emergency alert to her phone telling her to watch out for the oncoming fire.\n\nBrad Weldon, also from Paradise, did get a phone alert. But he said it came as he was already fighting off the flames surrounding his home.\n\nTheir experiences reflect a widespread issue for residents in Paradise and surrounding Butte County: Many people did not receive emergency alert warnings, and some who did received them too late.\n\nInstead, they learned of the danger not from authorities but through their own eyes and ears, or from concerned friends and family.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea defended the county's use of the emergency alert system during the fire. He said the situation was \"extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving\" and so it took time for fire experts to get to the scene, determine the fire's direction and warn the affected people -- time they just didn't have.\n\n\"There were notifications sent out, but as I said over and over again, this fire was moving so rapidly we couldn't keep ahead of it,\" Honea said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said landline phones are automatically enrolled in the county's alert system, but cell phones have to be opted in to get the alerts. She said they have conducted drives to get people to register, but she wasn't sure how many residents signed up.\n\n\"I got a phone call, I got texts on my cell phone. My husband got a phone call on the landline,\" she told CNN. \"So that's the kind of notification people would get. If they went outside they could see what was happening also.\"\n\nThe fire spread too quickly\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

Hide Caption 93 of 93\n\nThe questions over the use of the emergency alert system come as firefighters continue to battle the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe fire's rapid spread through the town of Paradise and beyond left at least 56 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes and structures, making it the most destructive and deadliest blaze in state history.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butte County sheriff published a list of more than a hundred people unaccounted for and still missing from the Camp Fire. The blaze, which has burned 140,000 acres, remains just 40% contained.\n\nHonea said that, for now, Butte County would continue to focus on assisting CalFire on fighting the Camp Fire. Once the fire is contained, they will go back and look closer into the emergency alert system, he said.\n\n\"We're getting a lot of requests and calls from people who want us to spend a lot of time going back and collecting data and there will be a time for that, but right now I need to focus on the fight in front of us,\" Honea said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape 02:15\n\nAs Honea noted, the speed of the fire took everyone by surprise and left residents of Paradise scrambling to escape in car and on foot.\n\nThe Camp Fire charred 20,000 acres last Thursday in less than 14 hours . Its most significant growth period was early Thursday afternoon, when it grew 10,000 acres in about 90 minutes -- burning the equivalent of more than one football field every second during that time.\n\n\"We did our absolute best in terms of Amber-style alert, we used emergency mass notification system as well as our efforts to notify people when we're in the communities. We employed that,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea offered several other explanations for why the alerts did not reach people in harm's way.\n\nHe said the fire took place in a remote area where cell phone service may not be great. He also said that some people who received the warning may not have acted immediately to get out, and suggested that people may have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding fires.\n\n\"I don't think it would be appropriate to draw the conclusion that because (bodies) were found in their house, you can automatically assume they were not notified,\" he said. \"It is possible that they were notified but they chose not to heed the warning and we have heard of stories like that.\"\n\n'For the most part, our plan worked'\n\nMayor Jones said that the fire simply moved too quickly, especially compared to 2008's devastating fire season.\n\n\"I mean, it just happened so fast. There wasn't time to give anybody longer. In 2008, we had three hours between the first notice and the mandatory evacuation. We had three hours to pack up stuff,\" she said.\n\nThis time, though? \"We had no time at all. Maybe five minutes,\" she added.\n\nAbout 26,000 people live in Paradise, some 85 miles north of Sacramento. Jones estimated that about 80 to 90% of the town was destroyed.\n\nStill, despite the issue with the alert system, she defended the evacuation plan, calling it \"organized chaos.\"\n\n\"It did take time to get everybody through just because so many people were evacuated at the same time,\" she said. \"But I think for the most part, our plan worked. If we hadn't had that plan, it would have been awful.\"\n\nLast October, officials in Northern California faced similar criticism from residents who said they learned of the fire by the smell of smoke or noise from their pets rather than from an emergency alert.\n\nAt the time, Kelly Huston, then the deputy director for California's Office of Emergency Service, said alerts and warnings happen on a local level, not a state level.\n\n\"They decide what are the appropriate alerts for their population,\" Houston said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Search for remains continues", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/GAeFXCEZ9pU/california-camp-fire-search-for-remains-victims-dan-simon-pkg-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "As the death toll rises in communities ravaged by the Camp Fire, rescue workers are in Paradise, California, searching for human remains and any victims who are still unaccounted for after the blaze.

But if its equipment is found to be responsible for it, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the fire is far from being under control, which means more damage is likely. PG&E said in the filing that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimates the fire won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nThe damages alone could cost up to $6.8 billion. according to a report from Moody's this week.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover the cost that, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay. The utility said in its filing that it currently has $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nShares of PG&E ( PCG ) plunged more than 30% Wednesday following this disclosure and were briefly halted for volatility. The stock has now fallen by half since the Camp Fire began.\n\nPower lines rest on cars that were burned by the Camp Fire on November 10, 2018 in Paradise, California.\n\nThe utility could need another bailout from the state of California if it's found to be liable for the Camp Fire.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown signed a bill in September that lets PG&E issue bonds backed by surcharges from the utility's customers. Those bonds would help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nPG&E already faces one lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Camp Fire.\n\nA group of law firms that has dubbed itself the Northern California Fire Lawyers filed a suit Tuesday on behalf of Camp Fire survivors.\n\nThe firms allege in the suit that \"PG&E was negligent in failing to maintain its infrastructure and properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines.\"\n\nA spokesperson for PG&E told CNN Business that \"it's important to remember that the cause has yet to be determined.\"\n\n\"We are aware of lawsuits regarding the Camp Fire. Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers,\" the spokesperson added."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Cell phone videos show drivers fleeing fire", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/h0ElPZeBMpE/california-wildfires-orig-acl.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Bill Nelson narrowly behind his challenger, Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nBut even though a recount will keep Nelson in the fight for at least another few days, his odds of winning might have been further narrowed on Thursday, when the machine recount \u2014 which ended at the 3 p.m. deadline \u2014 yielded a few dozen more votes for Scott, whose lead now stands at more than 12,600, or 0.15%.\n\nThe race for governor remained outside the 0.25% margin required for a hand recount, meaning Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis will likely be the state's next chief executive over Democrat Andrew Gillum. The Tallahassee mayor, who picked up a single vote in the recount, revoked his concession last weekend and said on Thursday he would continue to push for all votes to be counted.\n\nElection boards across the state have been using voting machines to recount ballots this week, with some of the larger counties working all day and through the night. When Thursday's deadline hit, three statewide races -- the contests between Nelson and Scott for Senate; Gillum and DeSantis for governor; and Republican Matt Caldwell and Democrat Nikki Fried for agriculture commissioner -- were within the .5% margin required for a statewide machine recount.\n\nBoth the Senate and agricultural commissioner races are now headed to hand review of overvotes and undervotes, a more narrowly circumscribed but also potentially volatile pool of votes. These are ballots where the voter appeared to tick off more candidates than allowed (overvotes) or on which they voted for fewer candidates than allowed (undervotes).\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Analysis: Bill Nelson needs a miracle in Florida.

Bill Nelson to keep his Senate seat.\n\nAppearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer projected confidence about Nelson's chances.\n\n\"Bill Nelson is -- is strong as could be,\" Schumer said. \"He believes, I believe, he's won a majority of the votes, and as long as they're counted, he will continue being senator from Florida.\"\n\nHistory says this is very unlikely and Republican Gov. Rick Scott will maintain his lead over Nelson. Indeed, there doesn't seem to be a precedent for the type of change Nelson needs to overtake Scott.\n\nScott holds a little more than a 12,000 vote lead over Nelson. That amounts to an advantage of about 0.15 percentage points, which is well within the 0.25 point margin needed for a manual recount required by Florida law. This margin may seem small, but for recount purposes, it is actually quite large.\n\nAccording to a FairVote database of statewide recounts from 2000 to 2015, the average recount moves the margin by 0.02 points. Nelson needs the margin to move by nearly eight times as much.\n\nThe recount with the largest shift was the Vermont Auditor of Accounts race in 2006. The margin shifted in that by 0.11 points, which is still less than what Nelson needs.\n\nIn terms of pure votes, it doesn't look any better for Nelson. The average recount from 2000 to 2015 shifted the result by 282 votes. You don't need to be a math wizard to know that 282 is considerably less than 12,000. The maximum change in the margin in any recount from 2000 to 2015 was 1,247 votes. That is far less than the change in the margin Nelson needs to overtake Scott.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, this 1,247 margin shift occurred in Florida in 2000. Democrat Al Gore was ultimately unsuccessful in that recount effort. Part of the reason he may have been unsuccessful was that the US Supreme Court effectively shut down a manual recount before it could be completed.\n\nEven if said recount had been completed and under the most favorable standard to Gore, the margin would have only have shifted by about 2,000 votes. In terms of percentage points, it would have been a shift of around 0.05 points. Again, Nelson's hill is considerably greater than that.\n\nVery few recounts actually turn losers into winners. Just 3 of the 27 elections (11%) examined by FairVote ended up with a different winner at the end of the recount versus the start of it.\n\nAll three of these recounts support the idea that Nelson has a tough row to hoe. One was the aforementioned Vermont Auditor of Accounts election in 2006. The other two are considerably better known.\n\nThe 2004 Washington gubernatorial election started with Republican Dino Rossi leading Democrat Christine Gregoire by 261 votes or 0.01 points. After a machine recount, Rossi's lead dropped to 42 votes or 0.002 points. A manual recount gave Gregorie the win by 129 votes or 0.005 points. All told, the margin shifted by 390 votes or a little less than 0.015 points. In terms of percentage points, Nelson would need a shift of 10 times that to emerge victorious in Florida.\n\nNelson shouldn't be anymore encouraged by Minnesota's 2008 Senate recount. Republican Norm Coleman headed into a manual recount up by 215 votes or a little less than 0.01 points on Democrat Al Franken. Franken ended up winning the recount by 225 votes or a little less than 0.01 points. That's a change of only 440 votes or less than 0.02 points. Like in the Washington example, Nelson would need a much bigger change in Florida to pull out ahead.\n\nOf course, recounts are tricky things. The sample size isn't so great as to say Nelson has no chance. Maybe something truly funky happened in Florida.\n\nHistory, though, is highly suggestive of the next senator from Florida being a Republican."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Broward County recounted hundreds of thousands of votes for nothing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/OygVwU2sq78/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) It's a long-agonized-over machine recount total delivered two minutes too late.\n\nBut there's nothing ironic about it -- this is, after all, Florida's Broward County, which has been plagued with issues in its vote-counting efforts for years.\n\nGiven that history, it was unsurprising -- but still galling to volunteers -- when the director of elections here revealed that the county had submitted its machine recount data two minutes after the state-mandated 3 p.m. Thursday deadline.\n\nThe secretary of state's office did not accept the new numbers and so, after days of painstaking work, Broward's count Thursday remained the same as it was on Saturday, when it submitted its initial unofficial election results.\n\n\"Basically, I just worked my ass off for nothing,\" said Joe D'Alessandro, the director of elections for Broward County.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "'He's pissed \u2014 at damn near everyone'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/TnNBKONJPPI/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) A political clobbering, bickering aides and now a public grenade launched across the White House by the first lady have placed President Donald Trump in a position he loathes: backed into a corner.\n\nA week after standing in the East Room and declaring victory in the midterm elections, the President is isolated and growing more furious by the day. He's openly speculating about replacing more members of his Cabinet , though so far has stopped short of executing the dismissals , leaving those aides in a career purgatory.\n\nAt an election night party at the White House, Trump left attendees guessing when he was spotted in a huddle with a potential replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly, who himself stood awkwardly in a corner.\n\n\"Yes, he's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official said, noting the mood in the Oval Office is darker than normal this week. After nearly a month straight of campaigning before adoring crowds, the applause has gone silent and the President has retreated. The tempest has led to rampant speculation inside the building about the fates of other senior staffers, some of whom are beginning to plan their exits.\n\nFriends of the President describe him as embittered by the election losses and troubled by the Mueller investigation. He met Monday with his lawyers to go over a series of written questions from the special counsel. Some of his longtime confidants are worried for his health, believing he's gained weight and looks unwell.\n\nThe President's fury at special counsel Robert Mueller burst into view again Thursday morning when he unleashed a string of angry tweets about the special counsel.\n\nThe timing for the President's fury couldn't be worse, considering the White House is heading into uncharted territory with Democrats assuming control of the House. Trump has told some advisers he's itching for the fight, believing it can provide him a political foil. Meanwhile, Mueller is inching closer to issuing his report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\"He knows it's winding up. So, it's unsettling,\" another person close to the President said.\n\nIt was a 24-word statement from the East Wing, where the first lady and her small staff work, about a presidential adviser that revealed how the dysfunction inside the White House is deeper and more tangled than previously known.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" a spokeswoman for Melania Trump said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nYet a day after that extraordinarily public rebuke, Mira Ricardel reported to work in the suite of offices in the National Security Council . After Ricardel was not even given the dignity of being named in the statement -- which referred to her only as \"she\" -- everyone in the West Wing was saying her name on Wednesday as anxiety intensified about what this latest feud would mean for the President's mood. Later Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIn the last week, the President's frayed and fraught relationships have been laid bare for all to see: He's furious at Kelly for a Paris trip that ended in a public relations debacle. He's blaming his political advisers for losing the winning narrative of the midterms. And he was caught off guard by his wife's shot across the bow at one of the top advisers in the West Wing -- a sign that their private conversations clearly aren't functional.\n\nAfter his wife ordered the astounding statement to be released Tuesday afternoon, Trump was furious that what had been an internal staffing matter was now thrust into public view, leaving him to look like a bossed-around husband. The President's mood was dark and intense after what officials said was a blindsiding by aides who do not report to him.\n\nIf the sudden public interest in Ricardel, a behind-the-scenes operator, came as a surprise to the President, however, the underlying issues between her and the first lady's office were not new.\n\nThe Ricardel affair\n\nTwo sources said the first lady's office believed Ricardel accused members of their staff of inappropriate behavior as part of her trip to Africa last month, and asked for the White House counsel's office to investigate. The counsel's office declined, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's on top of concerns that Ricardel treated the trip dismissively and interfered with seating arrangements on the first lady's plane.\n\nIt became \"very personal\" to the first lady, one person familiar with the matter said, because she \"ran over Melania's staff.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said the first lady and her aides sought to take issue with Ricardel through \"appropriate channels\" for weeks, including Kelly, but nothing came of their concerns.\n\nOther officials said tensions between the first lady and Ricardel stemmed from more than just the deputy national security adviser's handling of her Africa trip, noting friction had developed over how Ricardel treated administration staff in general.\n\n\"It's true there was infighting between Mira and the first lady's staff. And it's true that the Africa trip was a big part of the tension,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \"But the reason the first lady asked for Mira to be fired was that the first lady believed she was a bully.\"\n\nThe episode came against the backdrop of broader tensions between the National Security Council and others in the West Wing who have bristled at the way national security adviser John Bolton has run his team. One senior White House official said some had viewed Bolton as more interested in serving as a personal adviser to the President than in running the day-to-day operations of the National Security Council.\n\nRicardel was Bolton's highest-ranking aide at the National Security Council, and her gruff style matches that of her boss. Both have made enemies within the administration for appearing to discard opposing opinions while advancing their own.\n\nBut when the first lady's office delivered its broadside against his top aide, Bolton was 10,000 miles away in Singapore on a trip with Vice President Mike Pence. Working against a 12-hour time difference, aides traveling with the national security adviser made furious calls to their colleagues back in Washington in an attempt to figure out what was going on and potentially stall Ricardel's firing. Bolton kept his head down, an official traveling with him said, and did not mention the drama publicly.\n\nMost viewed Bolton's efforts to preserve Ricardel's job as futile and just delaying the inevitable, which Bolton apparently realized after seeing the drama unfold from half a world away. But Trump had surprised staffers in the past, and there had been some speculation earlier Wednesday that Ricardel would end up in another position in the administration outside the National Security Council. The first lady does not offer the President staffing advice on a regular basis, but one former White House official said that when she does, it carries significant weight.\n\nPervasive dysfunction\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match 02:12\n\nThe episode underscored the dysfunction that continues to pervade West Wing staffing matters almost two years into the Trump presidency. It lays bare the continued factionalism pitting aides against each other, often in convoluted and unpredictable configurations. And it reflects the deep unease within the White House as Democrats prepare to launch an assault of investigations into all manner of administration business.\n\nStaffers are still coming to grips with the new political reality while responding to a freshly enraged President. The prospects for wide-ranging investigations launched by the new Democratic-led House have concerned aides, who worry about legal bills and the potential impact on their careers.\n\nA slow-rolling staff shake-up is far from over, with Kelly again the subject of rampant speculation, despite his proclamation earlier this year he would remain at Trump's side until 2020 . While the President has strongly considered Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff and an ally of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as a replacement for Kelly, there has been \"aggressive pushback\" against him, one senior official said. Some senior aides have even threatened to resign if Ayers is tapped for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother name discussed inside the White House as a potential Kelly successor is Johnny DeStefano, a senior aide to Trump who has quietly taken over a growing portfolio. DeStefano, a former top adviser to then-House Speaker John Boehner, has a solid relationship with the President and is generally well-liked among the staff.\n\nBut the President, who detests the narrative that his White House is chaotic, could ultimately decide not to ax Kelly -- if only to spite the press.\n\n\"The more the press writes that John Kelly is gone, the more Trump is emboldened to keep him just to prove them wrong,\" one source close to the White House said.\n\nFraught workplace\n\nTrump's foul mood, meanwhile, has rendered the White House a tumultuous workplace where outbursts are becoming more common. The decision to scrap a planned visit to an American cemetery in France because of rain over the weekend only deepened the President's conviction that he's being misserved by some of his staffers.\n\nTrump was advised by deputy chief of staff Zach Fuentes, a close aide of Kelly's, just ahead of his tense meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not be able to fly his helicopter to the Aisne-Marne cemetery, situated 50 miles from Paris. A drive, Fuentes said, would cause traffic havoc around Paris, and would also make Trump late to the event -- something he detests.\n\nSome aides told the President that he should not worry about missing the event because he had other opportunities to pay respects on the trip, including another cemetery visit scheduled for the following day, according to people familiar with the conversations. Neither they nor the President expected the massive backlash the decision prompted, which sank in over the course of the following hours. As he watched the onslaught of headlines criticizing him for skipping the trip with no backup plan, the President took his anger out on Fuentes personally.\n\nWhiling away the empty hours at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, Trump complained the entire trip to France was poorly conceived and executed, according to people familiar with the matter. He'd long discovered the events on Sunday would not include a grand military parade like the one he witnessed a year ago on Bastille Day, leading him to wonder what the point of the trip was.\n\nInstead, Trump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nAs they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing. And they worked to set up phone calls with officials back home in the hopes of keeping him occupied.\n\nA brewing presidential tempest\n\nThe clouds started gathering on election night, people familiar with the matter said. Surrounded by his wealthy friends, three oldest children and select senior staffers, Trump entered a White House watch party a week ago in a cheerful mood. But as he huddled over pizza and tiny hotdogs with some of his billionaire friends, the President began to see things shift. His mood went south. And the blame began flying.\n\nHe did everything his political team asked him to do, Trump protested to his friends. He did his job while others clearly had not.\n\nKelly, the beleaguered chief of staff, attended early in the evening with his wife. Long viewed by the President as lacking political acumen, Kelly appeared out of his realm, according to two sources familiar with the scene. He remained in a corner sipping a drink with his deputy.\n\nAn hour before midnight, the President -- visibly annoyed -- announced he was done. The rooms, which had been set up with large televisions for viewing results, began to empty. As attendees began trickling out, some saw an intriguing sight.\n\nHuddled in a corner, intense in conversation, were the President, his wife and Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, who has been speculated about as a leading contender to replace Kelly.\n\nTo those still there who saw, and others who later heard about it, it was a moment the President appeared to stage."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "For Trump, there's no easy way out of his funk", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Kzj2CZoG1gQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) By multiple accounts, Donald Trump is in one of the deepest funks of his presidency . The bad news is that the challenges and threats that are making his mood so dark are likely to get worse before they get better.\n\nThe President is angry at his rebuke from voters in the midterm elections . The oppressive prospect of action by special counsel Robert Mueller hangs like an immovable cloud over his White House. Staff chaos in the West Wing is producing lurid palace intrigue stories in the media that the President hates\n\nAbroad, he feuds with allied world leaders, and he's been so effective in implementing his \"America First\" policy that he's the odd man out at summits.\n\nAnd things are unlikely to improve quickly. Many legal observers expect new indictments to come soon in the Mueller probe, potentially bringing the investigation closer to Trump's inner circle in its final stages. The President fulminated over the probe on Thursday morning, calling it on Twitter \"A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n\nDemocrats are prepping a barrage of investigations that will make life in his White House a misery -- from attempts to seize his tax returns and probe his business dealings to investigations into key policy areas like immigration.\n\n\"He's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nTrump is letting off steam where he can. He's feuding with a former friend, Emmanuel Macron, mocking the French President's approval rating (at 29%, it is lower than Trump's) and the French jobless rate of over 9%.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller on Wednesday, the President betrayed his disturbed equilibrium, claiming that voter fraud had cost Republicans key races\n\n\"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again,\" Trump claimed, without evidence.\n\nNot the first President to feel this way\n\nTrump is not the first President to feel isolated, angry, rejected by voters or down in the dumps. Everyone who sits in the Oval Office feels that way sooner or later, though Trump's temperament is more volcanic than most.\n\nThe question for Trump is, what can he do -- other than a few restorative weekends on the golf course in Florida -- to improve his position ahead of a crucial period that will define opening chapters of his re-election campaign?\n\nOften when they are in trouble, Presidents engineer staff shakeups to bring in new ideas and energy. They go looking for wins in foreign policy, an area that pesky congressional foes can do little to disrupt.\n\nMore fundamentally, Trump could examine his entire political approach. While his strategy of division and tearing at cultural and racial divides helped him win the White House, it seemed to backfire in key House races. Failure to win back the suburbs could harm his hopes of winning a second term in 2020.\n\nIf Trump never gave another angry news conference or swore off explosive tweets, it's possible that his political situation -- and his 39% approval rating in the latest CNN poll -- would improve.\n\nAfter all he's kept many of his campaign promises. Unemployment is at its lowest point in half a century and economic growth is going gangbusters.\n\nAnd conservatives will thank Trump for decades for his two successful Supreme Court nominations.\n\nBut the President is so identified with convention-tearing tactics that it's probably impossible for him to change his style. It's probably too late as well, since he's made no effort to broaden his support base since taking office.\n\nTrump's tempestuous personality and unwillingness to be constrained also likely mean that another remedy available to other Presidents -- a hotshot new staffer to shake up operations in the West Wing -- is unlikely to work.\n\nHis first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, failed to impose order on Trump and was soon out the door. His successor, John Kelly, who is rumored to be on his way out, was soon drowned out by chaos.\n\nThe idea that Trump will look at election results, have some kind of political conversion and become a kinder, gentler President is also unthinkable.\n\nHe almost never admits he's wrong and he's been looking for people to blame for the GOP loss in the House.\n\nFor instance, the President listed GOP candidates who refused to accept his support -- or what he called \"the embrace\" -- at a post-midterm election news conference.\n\nA boost on the horizon?\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is potential Kelly replacement Nick Ayers? 02:21\n\nSo what about a win on the world stage to boost the President's spirits?\n\nThere's not a lot of low-hanging fruit. US Middle East policy is in uproar since it's anchored on Saudi Arabia, which is being ostracized over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.\n\nStill, a breakthrough in a joint US and British diplomatic bid to end the war in Yemen would not just boost Trump's political prospects, it also would be a significant victory for humanity.\n\nTrump's hopes of a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have taken a dent, with Pyongyang angry at the lack of concessions by the US and new indications that it is pressing ahead with its missile program.\n\nLater this month, Trump will head to the G20 summit. Progress in defusing his trade war with China at his talks there with President Xi Jinping -- or even a ceasefire -- could be spun as a foreign policy victory.\n\nTrump is also expected to meet with Vladimir Putin at the summit in Argentina. But that's a potential political landmine, given allegations of Russian election interference that have produced unflattering media coverage of his chats with the Russian leader, which has infuriated the President.\n\nThe chances of significant wins at home also seem slim, given the gridlock that will descend on Washington when Democrats take the House gavel.\n\nBut Trump mused after the midterm elections that the new arrangements might be more conducive to deal-making than had a thin GOP majority materialized.\n\n\"This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't,\" he said.\n\nTrump seemed like someone trying to convince himself as much as the reporters in the room. But it's possible there is common ground on issues like prescription drug prices or infrastructure.\n\nThere was actually a ray of light on Wednesday when Trump had Democrats and Republicans to the White House to sign a bill that represents a small step toward criminal justice reform.\n\n\"Did I hear the word bipartisan?\" Trump quipped at the signing ceremony.\n\nOnce the Democratic subpoenas start flying, however, the room for compromise might shrivel.\n\nSo Trump will have one final option -- elevate an enemy -- a device he has effectively used throughout his political and business career.\n\nHe could choose to stage a showdown over a year-end spending bill to wring more financing for his border wall out of Congress. Though it's not clear that the possible government shutdown that could result would help him politically.\n\nThere is an argument that Trump will actually profit from lining up against a Democratic-led House next year -- especially if Nancy Pelosi, whose approval ratings are worse than his, gets her old job back as speaker.\n\nWhen 2019 dawns, a flurry of Democrats are likely to begin launching presidential campaigns, giving him an excuse to head out to the place where he always feels best: among his adoring throngs on the campaign trail."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "High school e-cigarette use has jumped nearly 80%.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts, with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to \"asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul, vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.

As well as issues with mobility and comfort, the twins had recently been losing weight, which was a concern to doctors, Elizabeth Lodge, CEO of Melbourne-based nonprofit Children First Foundation, which funded the operation said last month.\n\nThe girls' operation was estimated to cost about $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), according to 9 News.\n\n'Delightful to look after'\n\nNurse coordinator Smith said Nima and Dawa have been a delight to look after, and that their personalities were shining through.\n\nMegan Collins, another nurse on the ward, agreed that the pair were in good spirits.\n\n\"They're loving interacting with the nursing staff,\" Collins said.\n\nThe operation was estimated to have cost around $180,000 (250,000 Australian dollars), which was raised by Children First Foundation.\n\n\"We're now blowing bubbles and doing high fives, they love it when we're watching the Wiggles -- they'll do little dance moves with their hands and what-not,\" Channel 7 reported Collins as saying during a press conference.\n\n\"It's really nice to see them separated. But they're still really happy about wanting to be close to one another.\"\n\nDifficult surgery\n\nConjoined twins occur once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female, and they are always identical twins.\n\nScientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides.\n\n\"The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared, as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThey were previously commonly referred to as \"Siamese twins,\" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker, conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated, they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.\n\nPhotos: Conjoined twins separated: New life, apart Anias, left, and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head, something only seen in 1 out of every 2.5 million live births.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Parents accuse CDC of not reporting children's deaths from polio-like AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/o2QBtMJhUpM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:15", "body_paragraphs": "Moseley, Virginia (CNN) Parents of children who had a horrifying polio-like illness are accusing the Centers for Disease Control of hiding the deaths of two children who suffered from the condition.\n\nThe parents say by not publicly acknowledging the two deaths, the agency is intentionally downplaying the severity of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a disease that paralyzes healthy children in a matter of hours.\n\n\"I feel like they're just sugar-coating this,\" said Katie Bustamante, whose son Alex, age 6, died in May. \"It eliminates my trust in the CDC.\"\n\nTheir accusations come amid a wave of criticism from parents of children with AFM and from some of the CDC's own medical advisers. In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "As more cases confirmed, CDC says evidence suggests 'viral association' for AFM", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/E9Lz63t48Sg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:16", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, a polio-like illness that mostly affects children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.\n\nThere are also 162 possible cases under investigation, 23 more than last week.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nThe agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.\n\nThe CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report, \"Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that the agency is \"not ruling anything out.\"\n\nIn the past two weeks, the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM.\n\nEnteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.\n\nTypically, enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy.\n\nSome of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus, but others have not, although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus.\n\nIt's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family, several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms, but only one may become paralyzed.\n\nTwo weeks ago , four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide, looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes.\n\nThe experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes, which they said were highly unlikely, and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.\n\n\"I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this,\" Dr. Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said of the CDC's new report. \"It's great.\"\n\nVan Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it.\n\nDr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM, agreed. \"I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBoth neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks.\n\nJeremy Wilcox, a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September, also praised the agency for becoming more open.\n\nParents of children with AFM say that for years, their emails to the CDC went unanswered.

Her cabinet backed it on Wednesday - but there have since been resignations.\n\nTwo cabinet ministers, and two junior ministers, have resigned over the deal - while some Conservative MPs have attempted to force a leadership contest by writing letters of no confidence in the prime minister. What happens now?\n\nThe basics: A reminder\n\nThe UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice.\n\nMrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, on Wednesday evening. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.\n\nThe deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states.\n\nWhat has been agreed between the UK and EU?\n\nA draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU.\n\nIt is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.\n\nSo what about a trade deal?\n\nAlongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is a five-page \"political declaration\" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like.\n\nThis is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.\n\nThe political declaration envisages \"a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\".\n\nThere would be \"ambitious customs arrangements\" that \"build on\" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop.\n\nHave they solved the Irish border issue?\n\nThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nSo they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBut this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.\n\nMrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nThey could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When will Brexit happen?\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nA \"fair financial settlement\" from the UK - also known as the \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nProtection for 3,000 \"geographical indications\" including Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne and Welsh lamb\n\nWho has resigned?\n\nDominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary on Thursday morning, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over \"fatal flaws\" in the draft agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU \"blackmail\".\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department.\n\nNorthern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it \"leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation\".\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nAn emergency EU summit will be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.\n\nAfter that, Mrs May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it - something the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs have also said they will vote against it.\n\nIf Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out.\n\nOn Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was \"no question\" of reopening talks.\n\nMrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, \"nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow\" and it would mean taking \"a path of deep and grave uncertainty\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

So I'm a little bit sad about (the change). But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. So it is also a really exciting time. And I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. There are also several close replicas.\n\nBut the master kilogram's days are numbered. Its weight has changed over the years because it has deteriorated. The kilogram, like the pope, is infallible, so other weights have to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering, those responsible for maintaining the system plan to overturn Le Grand K's increasingly flawed rule.\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass spectrometry at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract its force.\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and, to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers were able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"Die Kleine h\".\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world have to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, if it is adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:00:59", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and

time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Exoplanet discovered around neighbouring star", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46196279", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:03", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: Barnard's Star b is thought to be quite cold\n\nAstronomers have discovered a planet around one of the closest stars to our Sun.\n\nNearby planets like this are likely to be prime targets in the search for signatures of life, using the next generation of telescopes.\n\nThe planet's mass is thought to be more than three times bigger than our own, placing it in a category of world known as a \"super-Earth\".\n\nIt orbits Barnard's star, which sits \"just\" six light-years away.\n\nThe star is an extremely faint \"red dwarf\" that's about 3% as bright as the Sun.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature, Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9 and colleagues say its newly discovered planetary companion has a mass 3.2 times bigger than the Earth's.\n\nDr Anglada Escud\u00e9 said it was \"possibly a mostly rocky planet with a massive atmosphere. It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Climate change: Report says 'cut lamb and beef'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46214864", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says.\n\nThe shift is needed, the government\u2019s advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases.\n\nThe report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane.\n\nThe farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers.\n\nBut environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid.\n\nThe CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK.\n\nThe un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2.\n\nThe committee\u2019s advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products.\n\nBBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmers\u2019 union, the NFU.\n\nTurning farmland into forests\n\nThe chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: \u201cClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks \u2013 and we also have to alter the way we use land so we don\u2019t make climate change worse.\n\n\u201cBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.\u201d\n\nCarbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs.\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \"The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy.\n\n\"We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted.\n\nHow climate change is already changing the landscape\n\nThe CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse.\n\nLoss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.\n\nProjections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.\n\n\"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "China Introduces New One-Uighur Policy", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/china-introduces-new-one-uighur-policy-1830475863", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:07", "body_paragraphs": "BEIJING\u2014In an effort to reduce the risk of overpopulation within the Muslim ethnic group, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the decision Thursday to implement a new one-Uighur policy. \u201cThis new policy is an important step in keeping the Uighur population down to a number we find most manageable and best for the nation as a whole,\u201d said the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, explaining that the policy would ensure that the country\u2019s resources could be fairly distributed throughout the nation\u2019s population of 1.386 billion people as well as the single remaining Uighur citizen. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to be reasonable.

rejected its officials were behind the killing, but as Turkish authorities continued to leak evidence of high-level involvement, Riyadh eventually admitted its agents had played a role in the killing with a series of contradictory explanations.\n\nI have a lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid Bob Corker, Republican Senator\n\nOn Thursday, Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor said they will seek the death penalty for five individuals accused of carrying out Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThe authorities said 21 people were in custody over the killing, with 11 indicted and referred to trial.\n\nSaud Al-Qahtani, a key aide of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been banned from travelling and remained under investigation, Saudi officials said.\n\nAnkara dismissed the latest account by the kingdom as \"inadequate\".\n\nTurkish officials have said it is unlikely Khashoggi could have been killed without the knowledge of the crown prince, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying the orders came from \"the highest levels of the Saudi government\".\n\n'Insufficient'\n\nEarlier on Thursday, US politicians welcomed the US sanctions against Saudi officials, but many also said the punitive measures did not go far enough.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker called the sanctions a \"significant step\", but added that he hopes additional action will be taken.\n\n\"I have a lot of concerns about the trajectory that Saudi Arabia is on right now, and I think a price needs to be paid,\" the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n\nCorker said he has requested a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and CIA Director Gina Haspel \"to share with us [the Senate] exactly what is happening with the US response to Saudi Arabia\".\n\nBob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senator Foreign Relations Committee and one of the Senators who authored Thursday's bill, said the sanctions were a \"good first step\", but with the Saudi announcement about the death sentences, the US move \"looks like a coordinated attempt to sweep this case under the rug.\"\n\nOthers took their calls a step further, demanding the US to take action against the Saudi crown prince himself.\n\nDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine, who represents Virginia, where Khashoggi lived, said the sanctions were \"insufficient\" and suggested the administration of US President Donald Trump is \"following the Saudi playbook\".\n\n\"This was state-sponsored murder. We need accountability,\" Kaine tweeted.\n\nDemocratic Senator Ben Cardin said he remains \"concerned that the [Trump] administration is enabling the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its effort to protect Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from accountability\".\n\nHe added, \"It is difficult for any reasonable person with knowledge of Saudi Arabia's government to believe such high-level officials would conduct a plot of this significance without the direction of the Crown Prince.\"\n\nSaudi officials maintain bin Salman had nothing to do with Khashoggi's death.\n\n'Involved in abhorrent killing'\n\nThe US sanctions on the 17 Saudi nationals were issued under the Global Magnitsky Act, which was triggered last month by a bipartisan group of Senators. The measures on Thursday targeted al-Qahtani, who is believed to have managed the operation to kill the Saudi writer.\n\nOthers targeted included Maher Mutreb, another aide to the prince, who was pictured at Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the day of the slaying.\n\n\"The Saudi officials we are sanctioning were involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\n\"These individuals who targeted and brutally killed a journalist who resided and worked in the United States must face consequences for their actions,\" he added.\n\nThe sanctions block the individuals' assets in the US and generally prohibit US persons from engaging in transactions with those sanctioned.\n\nThe State Department called the sanctions \"an important step in responding to Khashoggi's killing\"."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Malaysia says no 'U-turn' in death penalty abolition", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/malaysia-turn-death-penalty-abolition-181115061626577.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - As a lawyer, Liew Vui Keong helped one of his clients appeal successfully against a death sentence.\n\nNow, as Malaysia's minister in charge of law, he is working to get the death penalty abolished in it entirety.\n\nThe legislation could be introduced in parliament before the house finishes its current sitting in the middle of next month.\n\n\"We have made a decision and I don't think we are going to make a U-turn,\" Liew, the de facto law minister, told Al Jazeera. He said studies showed that capital punishment was not an effective deterrent.\n\n\"The [only] question is whether we can do it in this session [of parliament] or the next.\"\n\nAbolition of the death penalty was part of the election manifesto of the coalition that took power in May, the country's first change in government in six decades.\n\nWith the repeal, it joins only a handful of countries in the Asia-Pacific that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, and hands a reprieve to the 1,281 people who were on death row as of October 29.\n\nA moratorium on all executions - Malaysia hangs those found guilty of capital crimes - is already in force.\n\nDeath row inmates are held in solitary confinement from the time of their conviction, and allowed out of their cells for just an hour each day, according to those allowed to visit them.\n\nMany have been there for years as their appeals make their way through the courts; a process lawyers say can take at least a decade.\n\nAbout one-quarter have been found guilty of murder.\n\nBalancing feelings\n\nSome families, including relatives of murdered activist Bill Kayong and deputy public prosecutor Kevin Morais, have already said they don't support the abolition.\n\nLast week's death of an 11-month-old baby, suspected of being abused in the care of a babysitter, has also prompted calls to maintain the death penalty for the most serious crimes.\n\n\"This is where I have to balance the feelings of the family of the victims who were murdered,\" Liew told Al Jazeera. \"The Pardons Board can sit now to decide whether they want to commute that particular person to either life imprisonment or imprisonment for life.\"\n\nThe start of that sentence should also date from the time the board makes its decision on the offender, rather than the date at which they were originally convicted, he added.\n\n\"The government must not take a blanket approach to deal with death row inmates upon abolition,\" the Anti-Death Penalty Coalition of Malaysia, a civil society group formed last month, said in a statement. \"The government must review each case individually as some of these crimes do not deserve the death penalty in the first place.\"\n\nIt's a view echoed by the Malaysian Bar. Sentences should be proportionate to the severity of the offence committed, its president George Varughese said.\n\nNearly three-quarters of those facing execution are people who have been found guilty of contravening Malaysia's harsh drug laws.\n\nUntil earlier this year, anyone found with a certain amount of drugs - 200 grams for cannabis and 15 grams for heroin - was considered a trafficker and faced a mandatory death sentence.\n\nBut recent amendments to Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act gave judges the option to sentence an offender to life in prison with 15 strokes of the cane, providing certain conditions were met.\n\n'I prayed'\n\nRestaurant worker Shahrul Izani Suparman liked to play football and hang out with his friends in his village in Selangor, a state on Malaysia's west coast.\n\nBut when he was 19 he was stopped at a police roadblock and arrested after officers found 622 grams of cannabis hidden in the motorbike he'd borrowed from a friend.\n\nSix years later he was sentenced to death - at that time the only option available to the judge - and transferred to death row where he found himself in a cell close to the \"bilik akhir\" - the final room - where inmates are taken the night before their execution.\n\n\"I prayed,\" Sapenah Nawawi, Shahrul Izani's mother, recalls in an interview through a translator. \"I thought if this is what is fated then I accept it. But if my son has a chance to live I hope he does.\"\n\nMany of the prisoners had been abandoned by their families who couldn't handle the social stigma of having a relative convicted to death, Shahrul Izani told her.\n\nHe thanked his mother for sticking by him.\n\nIn December 2016, with Shahrul Izani's appeals exhausted, prison officials called the family and asked them to come - all of them - for a special meeting.\n\nSapenah remembers the drive to the jail was tense. Everyone was worried it might be the last time they would see Shahrul Izani.\n\nBut when they sat down with the officials, it turned out the Sultan of Selangor, following a global campaign, had decided to commute his sentence to life in prison.\n\n\"When we heard the news we were so happy,\" she said. Everyone was in tears.\n\nSapenah supports the government's decision to abolish the death penalty.\n\n\"A life sentence is good enough,\" she said. \"It gives people a chance to repent and come out of prison a better person.\"\n\nMiscarriages of justice\n\nA year ago, South Korean student Kim Yun-soung was facing the death penalty on a charge of drug trafficking after being found with 219 grams of marijuana in a house south of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nBut the aircraft engineering student was freed after the main witness - the arresting officer - admitted lying about who was in the house at the time of the raid.\n\nThe police officer insisted in court there had been no one else at the scene of the arrest, but CCTV footage obtained by the defence clearly showed a second person in handcuffs.\n\n\"I am so happy and relieved and cannot describe my feelings,\" Kim's grandmother told the local media through tears of joy after he was acquitted.\n\nResearch from the Penang Institute, a think-tank, examining 289 capital cases found \"inconsistency and a high judicial error rate\" when it came to the death penalty in Malaysia.\n\nUsing legal publication databases, the institute found on average more than one-quarter of High Court judgements and half of Court of Appeal decisions were overturned by the immediate higher courts, mostly in relation to evidence.\n\n\"Decisions made by the high court have more than a one-in-four chance of being overturned,\" the October 30 report noted.\n\nThe type of offence, the accused's ethnicity, nationality and even the location of the offence were all found to contribute to the errors, while women were far less likely to be acquitted in drug trafficking cases than men.\n\nLim Chee Han, one of the report's authors, said its findings were further evidence of the need for the death penalty's abolition.\n\n\"It's quite big considering this is a life and death matter,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n'A new era'\n\nAbout 44 percent of death row inmates in Malaysia are foreign nationals with the largest group from Nigeria, followed by Indonesia and Iran.\n\nThe Philippines is still reconciling the number of its nationals on death row. The embassy said there are \"at least 50\", including a group of nine who were sentenced to death for their part in the armed incursion into a settlement in southern Sabah.\n\nIt would like to see the commutation of sentences take into account each individual's crime.\n\n\"We are hoping the law will be more nuanced in terms of the severity of the crime,\" Ambassador Charles Jose told Al Jazeera.\n\nLiew said the priority now is to secure cross-party support to ensure the abolition's smooth passage through parliament. The cabinet has already directed all ministries to get feedback on the repeal.\n\nAt least 32 offences across eight different pieces of legislation currently carry the death penalty, and in some cases the sentence is mandatory.\n\nAll will need to be amended for the abolition to become a reality.\n\nLiew and his staff look queasy as they recall a recent visit to prison where officers explained how executions are carried out.\n\nThe inmate gets 48 hours notice and is moved to \"the final room\" the night before.\n\n\"It's just 15 seconds,\" Liew said of the time it takes from the hood being placed over the prisoner's head to their death on the gallows."}, {"site": "aljazeera", "category": "all", "feed_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml", "title": "Zuckerberg should 'step down' from Facebook, tech pioneer says", "article_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/zuckerberg-step-facebook-tech-pioneer-181116032516074.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:11", "body_paragraphs": "Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg should quit the social media giant because of its anti-democratic nature that is a danger to the world, a prominent critic of online activity says.\n\nOne of the early pioneers of virtual reality, Jaron Lanier, 58, has repeatedly warned of the destructive nature of digital society.\n\n\"I think it would be good for the world if [Zuckerberg] stepped aside,\" Lanier told UpFront host Mehdi Hasan. \"But the point is that there's no mechanism for him to do so.\n\n\"That [Facebook] is a one man shop is really, really not okay,\" Lanier added. \"It's not okay for the world.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:17", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy,\" Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them,\" said Vitousek, who was a post-doctoral fellow at the U.S. Geological Survey when he conducted this study.\n\nScientists apply \"CoSMoS-COAST,\" a newly-developed shoreline change computer modeling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 kilometers of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\n\n\"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defense against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 meter by 2100.\n\nCoastal communities threatened by sea level rise and heavy storms are particularly hard hit. And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "North Korea to Deport American Detained for Illegal Entry", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-to-deport-american-detained-for-illegal-entry/4661275.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:24", "body_paragraphs": "North Korea said Friday that it will deport an American citizen it detained one month ago for illegally entering the country.\n\nThe announcement suggests that North Korea still intends to improve ties with the United States despite stalled nuclear diplomacy.

That led authorities to devise a staggered evacuation plan, one that they used when fire came again last week.\n\nBut Paradise\u2019s carefully laid plans quickly devolved into a panicked exodus Nov. 8. Some survivors said that by the time they got the warnings, the flames were already extremely close, and they barely escaped with their lives. Others said they received no warnings at all.\n\nNow, with at least 59 people dead and perhaps 300 unaccounted for in the nation\u2019s deadliest wildfire in a century, authorities are facing questions of whether they took the right approach.\n\n\u200bA lesson for towns across the West\n\nIt\u2019s also a lesson for other communities across the West that could be threatened as climate change and overgrown forests contribute to longer, more destructive fire seasons.\n\nReeny Victoria Breevaart, who lives in Magalia, a forested community of 11,000 people north of Paradise, said she couldn\u2019t receive warnings because cellphones weren\u2019t working. She also lost electrical power.\n\nJust over an hour after the first evacuation order was issued at 8 a.m., she said, neighbors came to her door to say: \u201cYou have to get out of here.\u201d\n\nShari Bernacett, who with her husband managed a mobile home park in Paradise where they also lived, received a text ordering an evacuation.\n\n\u201cWithin minutes the flames were on top of us,\u201d she said.\n\nBernacett packed two duffel bags while her husband and another neighbor knocked on doors, yelling for people to get out. The couple grabbed their dog and drove through 12-foot (4-meter) flames to escape.\n\n\u200bEvacuation orders\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, survivors said authorities need to devise a plan to reach residents who can\u2019t get a cellphone signal in the hilly terrain or don\u2019t have cellphones at all.\n\nIn his defense, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said evacuation orders were issued through 5,227 emails, 25,643 phone calls and 5,445 texts, in addition to social media and the use of loudspeakers. As cellphone service went down, authorities went into neighborhoods with bullhorns to tell people to leave, and that saved some lives.\n\nHonea said he was too busy with the emergency and the recovery of human remains to analyze how the evacuation went. But he said it was a big, chaotic, fast-moving situation, and there weren\u2019t enough law enforcement officers to go out and warn everyone.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have thousands and thousands of people in shelters would clearly indicate that we were able to notify a significant number of people,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nProgress on fire\n\nSome evacuees were staying in tents and cars at a Walmart parking lot and in a nearby field in Chico, though volunteers planning to close the makeshift shelter by Sunday were working to transition people to other locations.\n\nA Sunday closure \u201cgives us enough time to maybe figure something out,\u201d said Mike Robertson, an evacuee who arrived there Monday with his wife and two daughters.\n\nOn Thursday, firefighters reported progress in battling the nearly 220-square-mile (570-square-kilometer) blaze. It was 40 percent contained, fire officials said. Crews slowed the flames\u2019 advance on populated areas.\n\nCalifornia Army National Guard members, wearing white jump suits, looked for human remains in the burned rubble, among more than 450 rescue workers assigned to the task.\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to travel to California on Saturday to visit victims of the wildfires burning at both ends of the state. Trump is unpopular in much of Democratic-leaning California but not in Butte County, which he carried by 4 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Paradise fire once again underscored shortcomings in warning systems.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown signed a bill in September requiring the development of statewide guidelines for Amber Alert-like warnings. A few Northern California communities are moving to install sirens after some wine country residents complained they didn\u2019t receive warnings to evacuate ahead of a deadly wildfire in October 2017 that destroyed 5,300 homes.\n\n\u200bLessons from 2008\n\nIn 2008, the pair of wildfires that menaced Paradise destroyed 130 homes. No one was seriously hurt, but the chaos highlighted the need for a plan.\n\nParadise sits on a ridge between two higher hills, with only one main exit out of town. The best solution seemed to be to order evacuations in phases, so people didn\u2019t get trapped.\n\n\u201cGridlock is always the biggest concern,\u201d said William Stewart, a forestry professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAuthorities developed an evacuation plan that split the town of 27,000 into zones and called for a staggered exodus. Paradise even conducted a mock evacuation during a morning commute, turning the main thoroughfare into a one-way street out of town.\n\nLast week, when a wind-whipped fire bore down on the town, the sheriff\u2019s department attempted an orderly, phased evacuation, instead of blasting a cellphone alert over an entire area.\n\n\u200b\u2018No one could plan for a fire like that\u2019\n\nPhil John, chairman of the Paradise Ridge Fire Safe Council, defended the evacuation plan he helped develop. John said that the wildfire this time was exceptionally fast-moving and hot, and that no plan was going to work perfectly.\n\nWhen the fire reached the eastern edge of Paradise, six zones were ordered to clear out about 8 a.m. But almost simultaneously, the gusting winds were carrying embers the size of dinner plates across town, and structures were catching fire throughout the city. Less than an hour later, the entire town was ordered evacuated.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work perfectly,\u201d John said Thursday. \u201cBut no one could plan for a fire like that.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Stewart, the forestry professor, said the wildfire that hit Paradise disrupted the orderly evacuation plan because it \u201cwas moving too fast. All hell broke loose.\u201d\n\nSatellite images show half the town on fire less than two hours after the first evacuation order.\n\nStewart said experts continue to debate how best to issue evacuation orders and no ideal solution has been found.\n\nAt the other end of the state, meanwhile, crews continued to gain ground against a blaze of more than 153 square miles (396 square kilometers) that destroyed over 500 structures in Malibu and other Southern California communities.\n\nAt least three deaths were reported."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Sanctions Saudi Arabian Officials but Questions Remain About Crown Prince", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-saudi-arabian-officials-questions-about-crown-prince/4661232.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "The United States has announced sanctions against 17 Saudi Arabian officials for their alleged involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, Oct. 2, 2018.

That mark will eclipse the record of 1,875 who served this year, according to reports Thursday from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nThe number could rise as ballot-counting concludes in close contests across the country. The Associated Press has not yet called 216 state legislative elections, races that include about 185 female candidates, according to the center.\n\nIn another first, women could end up holding the majority in two state legislative chambers at the same time \u2014 the Colorado House and Nevada Assembly \u2014 according to tallies by the center and the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\"It's about time,\" said Lisa Cutter, a Democrat who won a Colorado House seat in her first bid for office.\n\nHer victory came in a state with a long history of electing women. In 1894, Colorado became the first state to have women in its state legislature, when three were elected to the House.\n\nThe only previous time women made up the majority in a state legislative chamber was in 2009 and 2010 in New Hampshire's state Senate.\n\n#MeToo movement\n\nThe state lawmakers are part of a wave of women who ran and won this year for state and federal offices. They campaigned amid a spotlight on sexual harassment cast by the #MeToo movement, although polls showed that gender was only a minor concern for most voters.\n\nImproving access to health care, expanding early childhood development and boosting funding for K-12 education were cited as top priorities by many female candidates during this year's campaigns.\n\nDoreen Gallegos, a Democrat who was easily elected to a fourth term representing a Las Cruces-area district in the New Mexico House, said she believes those topics will get increased attention by having more women in state legislatures.\n\n\"There are certain issues that are closer to our hearts and our minds, maybe more than our male counterparts,\" Gallegos said.\n\nNationally, women led the Democrats' return to control of the U.S. House of Representatives as the number of GOP women serving will be down from the current 23 to as few as 13. Overall, there will be at least 102 women in the House next year, an increase of at least 18 over the current mark. The peak number of women in the House at one time was 85, for a brief period in 2016.\n\nThe U.S. Senate will have at least 23 women, tying the current total and record. That number would rise by one if Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith wins a runoff election in Mississippi next month.\n\nAt the state level, at least nine women will be governors, tying the record set in 2004 and 2007. Ballots are still being counted in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams is hoping to push the governor's race to a runoff.\n\nDespite this year's gains, American politics remain dominated by men, who will account for more than three-fourths of the seats in Congress and hold the governor's offices in four-fifths of the states.\n\nIt's at the state legislatures where women will hold a slightly larger proportion of the 7,383 seats \u2014 at least 27 percent.\n\nJust one time, or 'new norm'?\n\n\"We are very encouraged by these results. This is the largest increase in women's representation in state legislatures we've seen in some time, after more than a decade of relative stagnation,\" Debbie Walsh, direct of the Rutgers center, said in a statement. \"The only question that remains is whether 2018 was a one-off or a new norm.\"\n\nIn Colorado, Cutter found an easier path than expected to winning a suburban Denver district previously held by Republicans, when incumbent Timothy Leonard dropped out of the race over the summer.\n\nAn organizer of the 2017 Women's March in Denver, Cutter said she anticipates a different course in the Colorado Legislature if one chamber is dominated by women. She expects issues such as health care and the environment to be more prominent and a better spirit of cooperation to prevail.\n\n\"When more women are in power or at the table, you get better results,\" she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "US Senate Race in Florida Goes to Hand Recount", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-race-in-florida-goes-to-hand-recount/4661189.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:26", "body_paragraphs": "Florida's U.S. Senate race is going to an automatic hand recount as a federal judge angrily told election officials they are making the state a global \"laughingstock.\"\n\nFlorida state law requires a hand recount if a machine count finds the margin of victory is less than 0.25 percent.\n\nAs of late Thursday, Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson trailed his Republican challenger, Governor Rick Scott, by 0.15 percent.\n\nElection officials missed a Thursday deadline for recounting the ballots for the Senate, saying counting machines in Palm Beach kept breaking down.\n\nOfficials in Tampa Bay declined to turn in their recount result because it came up more than 800 votes short of the original Election Day tally.\n\nFederal Judge Mark Walker refused to extend the deadline and berated election officials for not anticipating problems.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have filed a number of lawsuits related to vote counting.\n\n\"We have been the laughingstock of the world election after election, but we've still chosen not to fix this,\" an angry Walker said Thursday.\n\nHe was no doubt also thinking about the 2000 presidential election which had to be decided by the Supreme Court when a statewide vote recount in Florida was turning into a mess of confusion, charges, and counter charges.\n\nWalker has also given voters until Saturday afternoon to correct their ballots if they weren't counted because of mismatched signatures.\n\nFlorida officials testified in court that nearly 4,000 ballots had already been rejected by local election officials because the signatures mailed in didn't match the signature on file.

He hopped barefoot from the prow, climbed a muddy slope and stared once more at what he'd lost.\n\nNot long ago, the clearing had been home to mangroves, saltwater-loving trees that anchor a web of life stretching from fish larvae hatching in the cradle of their underwater roots to the hornbills squawking at their crown. Now the trees' benevolent presence was gone, in their place a swath of stripped soil littered with felled trunks as gray as fossils.\n\n\"Do you think we can find any food in this place now?\" asked Bondien, a village leader of the Tombonuo people. \"The company thinks it can do anything it wants \u2014 that we don't count.\"\n\nThe company is Sunlight Inno Seafood. Owned by Cedric Wong King Ti, a Malaysian businessman known as \"King Wong,\" it has bulldozed swaths of mangroves in the Tombonuo's homeland in northern Borneo to make space for plastic-lined ponds filled with millions of king prawns. The shrimp are destined to be fattened for three months, scooped up in nets, quick-frozen, packed into 40-foot refrigerated containers and loaded onto cargo ships bound for distant ports.\n\nGargantuan as it may seem to Bondien and his relatives, the project represents only a speck in the global aquaculture industry, one of the world's fastest-growing sources of protein.\n\nUnfolding across Asia and around the world, this revolution in farming could help mitigate the impacts of climate change \u2014 or make them even worse.\n\nAs the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases causes the world's oceans to warm, ecosystems that formed hundreds of thousands of years ago are being upended in less than a human lifespan. Across the planet, fish and other marine creatures are being forced into a desperate search for cooler waters. Even coral is on the move: Some Japanese reefs are expanding northward at up to nearly nine miles per year, researchers have found.\n\nTropical seas may be the hardest hit. Species in the once-stable conditions near the equator could find it much harder to tolerate even mild temperature increases than hardier cousins at higher latitudes, which are used to coping with the contrast between summer and winter.\n\n\"If you ask me what is the No. 1 concern that I have on climate change effects on fisheries, it is on these tropical, developing countries,\" said William Cheung, director of science at the Nippon Foundation-University of British Columbia Nereus Program. \"The sheer speed of the change will make it that much harder for marine life to adapt.\"\n\nCoral reefs, as vital to tropical fish as trees are to birds, are becoming more vulnerable to a process called bleaching, which occurs when a spike in water temperatures causes coral to expel the algae that provide their kaleidoscopic colors, leaving them prone to starvation or disease. Today, swaths of the once-psychedelic Great Barrier Reef in Australia have turned boneyard white and largely devoid of life.\n\nScientists fear a similar fate could await the Coral Triangle, a huge underwater wonderland east of Borneo endowed with a trove of biodiversity comparable to the rainforests of the Amazon Basin. Millions of people depend on its bounty to survive, a large share of them Malaysians, who eat an average of 125 pounds of fish each a year \u2014 more than double the world average.\n\nWith climate change bearing down on the tropics, the search is on for a more sustainable way of getting food from the sea, one that doesn't take more than nature can give.\n\nFarther to the north on Borneo, an island divided among Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, villagers are raising sea cucumbers: curious-looking creatures resembling giant slugs that are typically braised and served with oysters, mushrooms and spring onions, or \u2014 if you're in Japan \u2014 thinly sliced, flavored with wasabi and eaten raw.\n\nThese echinoderms, close relatives of sea urchins and starfish, may not appeal to every palate. But farming them has one of the lightest footprints of any form of food production, a reminder of the vast untapped global potential for harvesting oysters, mussels, clams and many other types of filter-feeders.\n\nA couple of hours' drive from the Sunlight Seafood shrimp farm, inhabitants of the stilted village of Mapan Mapan have created a maze of sunken enclosures fenced with a barnacle-covered mesh.\n\nImmersed waist-deep in one of these briny paddocks, sea-cucumber farmer Astinah Binti Jamari plucked one of the sandpaper-skinned creatures from the seabed. It responded by squirting her with a jet of saltwater \u2014 a defense normally used to scare away crabs.\n\nA revolution in fish\n\nForty years ago, only 5 percent of the world's fish production was farmed. After decades of rapid growth, aquaculture reached a tipping point in 2013, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, when the amount the industry raised in cages, tanks and ponds outweighed the tonnage of freely swimming fish hauled from lakes, rivers and seas for people's plates.\n\n\u200bIn many respects, the industry has a good-news story to tell. Farmed salmon, for example, can convert feed into edible protein far more efficiently than cows or pigs, while producing fewer greenhouse gases. Now, almost all the salmon sold in restaurants and supermarkets is raised in captivity, with Norway, Chile and Scotland the biggest producers.\n\nBut this phenomenal expansion has come at a cost. The appetite for farmed species is so voracious, almost 20 percent of the annual catch from the world's seas is ground into fishmeal, a nutrient-rich powder that forms the basis of the feeds used from salmon cages in Scottish lochs to shrimp ponds on Borneo. Vast amounts of fish have been taken from poorer countries to feed species destined for the plates of wealthier consumers. In addition, shrimp farms, in particular, have made coastal communities in the tropics even more vulnerable by cutting down mangroves, their first line of defense against extreme weather and rising sea levels.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, the aquaculture industry has led to the destruction of more than 1.3 million acres of mangroves spread across Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil and Ecuador, according to a 2013 paper in the Bulletin of Marine Science. Untreated waste and epidemics of shrimp-killing diseases mean the gains can be short-lived: A study published this year identified more than half a million acres of abandoned shrimp ponds in Indonesia alone.\n\nNevertheless, some governments in Southeast Asia and Latin America have concluded that it's worth sacrificing more mangroves in return for the export earnings and employment the projects can generate. Among them is the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is a partner in King Wong's shrimp farm.\n\nHope of a better life\n\nIn 2013, representatives of Sunlight Seafood offered leaders of the Tombonuo and other indigenous communities a deal. In return for some of the land flanking the tidal creeks where their mangroves stood, locals recalled, the company would provide running water, electricity and much-needed employment for youths in the surrounding area, known as Pitas.\n\nFive years since the bulldozers went to work, Tombonuo community leaders say they've lost more than 2,000 acres of mangroves and that the jobs and infrastructure they were promised haven't materialized.\n\n\"I have no words. It's like we've lost our whole world,\" said Samad Samayong, a Tombonuo elder, surveying a sacred outcrop consecrated by his ancestors that is now encircled by shrimp ponds. \"We only realized what was happening when it was too late.\"\n\nOn the other side of a fence, a lone worker trudged past carrying a large bag of Royal Dragon brand shrimp feed on his shoulder. He didn't seem to notice Samayong and other Tombonuo watching from the trees.\n\nSunlight Seafood didn't respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment made by telephone, email and a letter hand-delivered to its office in Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah. Reuters also contacted a law firm in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, that had acted for the company in the past but received no reply.\n\nSunlight Seafood has issued statements to Borneo media saying the project was built on land long earmarked for aquaculture by government officials, and that it is boosting the economy in Pitas, one of the poorest districts in Sabah.\n\nThe sheer scale of the farm is only fully apparent from up close. In July, a Reuters reporter and photographer accompanied Samayong, Bondien and others on a three-boat party to various points where water from the ponds gushed from pipes, leaving foamy trails of scum in the creeks.\n\nIt took hours to trace even a portion of the fence enclosing the site. The barrier's stark edges cut a jarring contrast to the tangle of mangrove roots straddling saltwater and land, their branches home to proboscis monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, blue-eared kingfishers and storks.\n\nThe Sabah Environmental Protection Association, a nongovernmental organization, says Sunlight Seafood has already cut down 2,300 acres of mangroves, citing satellite imagery.\n\n\"They cleared the mangroves with no proper consultation with the community,\" said the group's president, Lanash Thanda. \"They have to redress the wrong they have done.\"\n\nApart from losing more trees, Samayong and Bondien fear diggers will further encroach on their ancestral shrines, such as an eerie riverbank guarded by a spirit husband and wife.\n\nVisiting on his boat, Bondien dedicated a cigarette he had rolled from mangrove bark to the couple, placing it on an altar made of branches.\n\n\"It's not only the forest that's being destroyed,\" said Mastupang Somoi, another member of the Tombonuo. \"It's our identity.\"\n\nTrees provide buffer\n\nWith evidence mounting that mangroves represent an effective buffer against climate impacts, some tropical countries are starting to question the gusto with which they once felled the trees, which can take 15 years to mature.\n\nWere it not for the way mangroves served as shields, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami could have taken many more than 220,000 lives. The trees can also help mitigate the impact of rising sea levels: Their multi-tiered root systems trap sediment to raise the land around them relative to the encroaching waves.\n\nEqually ingeniously, mangroves sequester more greenhouse gases than almost any other type of forest, as well as serving as natural larders of fish, birds, fruit and the kind of snails you can eat raw by snapping their conical shells and sucking out the innards.\n\n\"If you catch a fish in the open sea or off a coral reef, it may well have spent part of its life in the mangroves,\" said Dan Friess, an associate professor of geography at the National University of Singapore.\n\nSabah's government says it is committed to striking a balance between economic development and preserving Borneo's extraordinary natural heritage, including by designating extensive areas of forest as nature reserves for threatened orangutans and creating Malaysia's largest marine protected area.\n\nEarlier this month, Junz Wong, Sabah's agriculture minister, toured the Sunlight Seafood farm and said the company had operated \"quite professionally\" and created nearly 400 jobs. On his Facebook page, Wong said he had rejected a company request to cut down an additional 1,000 acres of mangroves. \"I told them NO,\" he wrote. \"No more destroying of mangroves.\"\n\nIn July, a Reuters reporter visited Sunlight Seafood's offices in a suburb of Kota Kinabalu and hand-delivered a letter summarizing the Tombonuo community's grievances and requesting an interview with owner Wong or another company representative.\n\nWhile the reporter was explaining the purpose of the letter to a worker who had been sent to meet him at the door, a security guard cut their conversation short and escorted the reporter off the premises. The guard then closed the gate to the driveway. It bore a large sign in red letters warning that trespassers would be prosecuted.\n\n\u200bFood without a face\n\nNestled in sea-cucumber farmer Jamari's palm, the specimen she had fished from the seabed convulsed with a slow-motion shudder. Jamari, once a struggling single parent, says the creatures came to her rescue, earning her enough money to put her five children through school and build a new house.\n\n\"The sea cucumbers are my treasure chest,\" she said. \"I can't even imagine what life would be like without them.\"\n\nMapan Mapan has earned so much money from its sunken farms that it has declared an annual sea cucumber \"birthday\" festival, at which villagers give thanks by stewing a share of their harvest in a communal meal.\n\nChinese traders have been importing sea cucumbers for more than a thousand years. Served at royal banquets, they were considered both a status symbol and an aphrodisiac. A Ming Dynasty book published in 1602 called \"Miscellanies of Five Items\" lists them as \"sea ginseng.\"\n\nThis mystique drives much of the appetite today. In the decade that ended in 2016, global production of sea cucumbers more than doubled to nearly 275,000 tons, according to the FAO.\n\nAt top Chinese restaurants, the echinoderms are used to make one of the world's most expensive soups, a broth called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall that can sell for $400 and needs to be ordered five days in advance.\n\nIrwin Wong is a manager at Oceandrive, a Malaysian seafood company that buys the sea cucumbers for export. He served as an adviser when Mapan Mapan started cultivating the creatures eight years ago in a 20-farmer pilot project backed by the local government. He says the scheme is harvesting wild sea cucumbers at a sustainable rate, but that even better management could help Borneo produce many more.\n\n\"Perhaps this is the lowest impact of all aquaculture activities,\" Wong said, standing on a platform overlooking a planned new phase, to be built with barnacle-proof mesh and more durable epoxy-coated stakes. \"It can seriously go very big.\"\n\nResearchers believe there is enormous potential to scale up global production of plankton-eaters such as scallops, clams, oysters, cockles and other bivalves \u2014 and, of course, sea cucumbers.\n\n\"The current way of feeding ourselves is simply not sustainable,\" said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research in Bremen, Germany. \"I think on a global level we have to start thinking about the lower levels of the marine food chain, such as bivalves, when it comes to supplying our proteins.\"\n\nScientific advisers to the European Union agree. They concluded last year that it should be possible to harvest a combined 165 million tons annually of bivalves and seaweed \u2014 almost double the world's annual landings of wild-caught fish.\n\nThe beauty of these creatures is that, unlike farmed fish or prawns, they don't require any feed apart from the nutrients they absorb from the sea. No mangroves have to be felled to culture them. Neither do they spew tons of fish waste or chemical pollutants. In fact, bivalves actually remove toxins from the water; a single oyster filters 50 gallons of seawater a day.\n\nYet even as the risks posed by climate change bring the potential of shellfish, seaweed and sea cucumbers into sharper focus, it is also putting them in danger. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, seawater is rapidly becoming more acidic. There is already evidence that acidification can make mussels' shells more brittle, or weaken their grip on rocks, leaving them at greater risk of being swept away by advancing waves.\n\n\u200b\u2018Preserve every species\u2019\n\nLife has been kind to the prize specimens at the Borneo Marine Research Institute: mammoth tropical fish known as giant grouper, which can weigh as much as a person, and in some cases have been swimming in spirals in silo-like tanks for almost 20 years. The only drama happens at feeding time. When fresh sardines hit the surface, the fish dart through the water with torpedo force.\n\nTheir wild relatives will have to work a lot harder to survive. In experiments to simulate the effects of more acidic waters, the institute has found that grouper \u2014 a staple in the Coral Triangle \u2014 find it harder to reproduce, and their young don't develop properly. The findings have sharpened concerns about what climate change will mean for the region's marine life, already struggling with plastic pollution, runoff from oil palm plantations, damage to reefs by dynamite fishing and the loss of mangroves.\n\nShek Qin, a research assistant, visits the busy fish-landing quay at Kota Kinabalu two nights a week to monitor catches of sharks and rays. In the early hours of a July morning, she picked up a newly landed shark by its tail, plonked it onto the dock and cheerfully inserted her forefinger into its mouth, peering inside to inspect the teeth \u2014 a trick for classifying a specimen more accurately, especially if fishermen have lopped off the fins.\n\n\"It's a whole food web: If one species is declining, others will get affected, too,\" Qin said, cradling a recently deceased hammerhead. \"That's why we need to preserve every species of fish.\"\n\nNear the fence surrounding the Sunlight Seafood shrimp farm, villagers Bondien and Samayong moored their flotilla under some mangrove trees and cast lead-weighted hooks. Samayong's daughter Ida remembered her grandfather regaling her with tales of the monster fish of his youth \u2014 notably, a ray he once caught that was bigger than his boat. But that day, nothing came to nibble.\n\n\"You used to be able to catch a fish here in 10 minutes,\" said Bondien, his line slack in the water. \"Now, even if you have good bait, you can wait an hour and get only one \u2014 maybe nothing.\"\n\nAround a bend in the river, an empty bag of Royal Dragon feed had become snagged in some mangrove branches.

The test measures symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia.\n\nPTSD also can be treated with medications or other types of talk therapy. Many of the participants were taking prescribed medicine for PTSD.\n\nMost of the vets were men with combat-related trauma, so it\u2019s not clear whether meditation would be equally effective in women or with other types of trauma.\n\nMore interest, styles\n\nThere\u2019s growing interest in meditation in the United States. A government survey last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently meditated, up from 4 percent from a similar survey five years earlier.\n\nThere are many styles of meditation. The type taught to vets in the study was transcendental meditation, or TM, which involves thinking of a mantra or sound to settle the mind.\n\nTM was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a guru to the Beatles in the late 1960s. Some of the study authors are affiliated with a university in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi. Their role was to oversee the meditation training.\n\nRutledge, who was the principal researcher, said he does not practice meditation himself.\n\nMeditation could be more acceptable to veterans who might associate mental health treatment with weakness, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably less threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be easier to talk to veterans about participating in

But the novelty has generated more dislikes than likes online among Chinese netizens, with many calling the new virtual host \u201ca news-reading device without a soul.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the latest creation has showcased China\u2019s short-term progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, but challenges remain ahead for its long-term ambition of becoming an AI superpower by 2030.\n\nNonhuman anchors\n\nCollaborating with Chinese search engine Sogou, Xinhua introduced two AI anchors, one for English broadcasts and the other for Chinese, both of which are based on images of the agency\u2019s real newscasters, Zhang Zhao and Qiu Hao respectively.\n\nIn its inaugural broadcast last week, the English-speaking anchor was more tech cheerleader than newshound, rattling off lines few anchors would be caught dead reading, such as: \u201cthe development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation and deep integration with the international advanced technologies.\u201d\n\nIt also promised \u201cto work tirelessly to keep you [audience] informed as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted\u201d 24/7 across multiple platforms simultaneously if necessary, according to the news agency.\n\nNo soul\n\nLocal audiences appear to be unimpressed, critiquing the news bots\u2019 not so human touch and synthesized voices.\n\nOn Weibo, China\u2019s Twitterlike microblogging platform, more than one user wrote that such anchors have \u201cno soul,\u201d in response to Xinhua\u2019s announcement. And one user joked: \u201cwhat if we have an AI [country] leader?\u201d while another questioned what it stands for in terms of journalistic values by saying \u201cWhat a nutcase.

It then uses a synthesized voice for the delivery of the news broadcast.\n\nThe creation showcases China\u2019s progress in voice recognition, text mining and semantic analysis, all of which is covered by natural language processing, according to Liu Chien-chih, secretary-general of Asia IoT Alliance (AIOTA).\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of many aspects of AI technologies, he wrote in an email to VOA.\n\nGiven the pace of experimental AI adoption by Chinese businesses, more user scenarios or designs of user interface can be anticipated in China, Liu added.\n\nChris Dong, director of China research at the market intelligence firm IDC, agreed the digital anchor is as simple as what he calls a \u201cuse case\u201d for AI-powered services to attract commercials and audiences.\n\nHe said, in an email to VOA, that China has fast-tracked its big data advantage around consumers or internet of things (IoT) infrastructure to add commercial value.\n\nArtificial Intelligence has also allowed China to accelerate its digital transformation across various industries or value chains, which are made smarter and more efficient, Dong added.\n\nFar from a threat to the US\n\nBut both said China is far from a threat to challenge U.S. leadership on AI given its lack of an open market and respect for intellectual property rights (IPRs) as well as its lagging innovative competency on core AI technologies.\n\nEarlier, Lee Kai-fu, a well-known venture capitalist who led Google before it pulled out of China, was quoted by news website Tech Crunch as saying that the United States may have created Artificial Intelligence, but China is taking the ball and running with it when it comes to one of the world\u2019s most pivotal technology innovations.\n\nLee summed up four major drivers behind his observation that China is beating the United States in AI: abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, growing AI expertise and massive government support and funding.\n\nBeijing has set a goal to become an AI superpower by 2030, and to turn the sector into a $150 billion industry.\n\nYet, IDC\u2019s Dong cast doubts on AI\u2019s adoption rate and effectiveness in China\u2019s traditional sectors. Some, such as the manufacturing sector, is worsening, he said.\n\nHe said China\u2019s \u201cstate capitalism may have its short-term efficiency and gain, but over the longer-term, it is the open market that is fundamental to building an effective innovation ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe analyst urges China to open up and include multinational software and services to contribute to its digital economic transformation.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s \u2018Made-in-China 2025\u2019 should go back to the original flavor \u2026 no longer Made and Controlled by Chinese, but more [of] an Open Platform of Made-in-China that both local and foreign players have a level-playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to a significant gap in core technologies, China\u2019s failure to uphold IPRs will go against its future development of AI software, \u201cwhich is often sold many-fold in the U.S. than in China as the Chinese tend to think intangible assets are free,\u201d AIOTA\u2019s Liu said."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Last Surviving Khmer Rouge Leaders Found Guilty Of Genocide", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khmer-rouge-convictions-war-crimes-genocide_us_5bee5db3e4b0510a1f2f63ed", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:33", "body_paragraphs": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 The last surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge that brutally ruled Cambodia in the 1970s were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes Friday by an international tribunal.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were sentenced to life in prison, the same sentence they are already serving after earlier convictions at a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers and mass disappearances of people. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nReuters Former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, left, and former Khmer Rouge leader \"Brother Number Two\" Nuon Chea were found guilty of genocide on Friday.\n\nBoth men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nThe verdict read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Nil Nonn established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Schoars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic group whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide. The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsibility.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead, their radical policies led to what has been termed \u2018auto-genocide\u2019 through starvation, overwork and execution.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. These offenses comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held. The prison and the courthouse were custom-built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.\n\nBoth defendants were present as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.\n\nKhieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.\n\nA large crowd of spectators attended Friday\u2019s session, including members of the Cham minority.\n\nLah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday\u2019s session. He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.\n\nJust talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life in those years, he said. The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labor, he recalled.\n\nLah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.\n\nIn addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nThere are fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions.\n\nCambodia\u2019s long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further case to go forward, claiming they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid courts in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to have more extensive proceeding has discomfited some observers, but others point to the tribunals accomplishments"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "Saudi Prosecutor Seeks Death Penalty In Khashoggi Murder Case", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-prosecutor-death-penalty-khashoggi_us_5bed5baae4b09f4670075395", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:34", "body_paragraphs": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five out of 11 suspects charged in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in a case that has strained the kingdom\u2019s ties with key Western allies, his office said on Thursday.\n\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policy, was killed in the country\u2019s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2, after a struggle, by a lethal injection dose and his body was dismembered and taken out of the building, deputy public prosecutor and spokesman Shaalan al-Shaalan told reporters.\n\nHe said the Washington Post columnist was murdered after \u201cnegotiations\u201d for his return to the kingdom failed and that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiating team that was sent to repatriate Khashoggi.\n\nRiyadh had offered numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance before saying he was killed in a rogue operation, in a case that has sparked a global outcry, opened the kingdom to possible sanctions and tarnished the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nTurkish officials have accused Prince Mohammed of ordering the murder while President Erdogan said the killing was ordered at the \u201chighest levels\u201d of the Saudi government.

Bobbitt, in court documents, claimed he only received $75,000.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear where the bulk of the $75,000 Bobbitt allegedly received went, he did admit to spending some of the money on drugs, Forbes reported.\n\n\u201cI always felt like I was in a weird situation.

He has a segment, called \u201cThe Cuck Zone,\u201d in which he often criticizes the Trumpier segments of the GOP.\n\nAccepting Miller as a friendly face in liberal circles required a certain transient amnesia about what the Republican Party is and how Miller has served it. The effort of not knowing became a lot harder on Wednesday, when The New York Times published a blockbuster report that, among other unseemly details, revealed that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm to push back against anti-Facebook groups. The campaign exploited the anti-Semitism on the right, encouraging reporters \u201cto explore the financial connections between [George] Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe Republican operative behind the campaign was none other than Miller.\n\nThis created an awkward situation for the boys of Crooked Media. When the story first dropped, Favreau disgustedly tweeted out the paragraph about the smears, seemingly without realizing it was his buddy who had propagated them. Several hours of silence later, the official Crooked Media account announced that Miller would not be contributing to Crooked while Favreau, Lovett and Vietor got \u201cto the bottom of Tim\u2019s involvement in this work.\u201d\n\nBut what about his involvement in their work? Miller\u2019s presence on the Crooked team was a modern media spin on a familiar phenomenon: prominent liberals inviting the right-wing weasels into the living room, allegedly in the interest of getting a different perspective, the totally predictable result of which is an orgy of special pleading and whitewashing. These days, there are few better publicists for the forces of illiberalism than the establishment liberals who wish to appear broad-minded.\n\nTo be fair, the bros of Crooked Media aren\u2019t wholly part of this same establishment liberal rot. They are far more humane and grounded than your average left-of-center D.C. politico. (I should mention here that I have appeared on Lovett\u2019s podcast). They don\u2019t really whine about civility. They don\u2019t make meaningless calls for bipartisanship (in government, at least). And for the most part, they rarely punch left. But they do have a weakness common to liberal creatures of the D.C. professional political class: their token Never Trumper.\n\nMuch like David Frum and Bill Kristol, Tim Miller has capitalized on his status as one of the country\u2019s dozen Never Trump Republicans for which establishment media remains insatiably horny. Miller puts a charming millennial twist on the type, perfect for the more youthful \u201cPod Save America\u201d crowd. He\u2019s become a regular contributor on Crooked Media\u2019s podcasts and has even written for its website.\n\nHere\u2019s what Miller had to say for himself, regarding his little Facebook anti-Semitism oopsie:\n\nFor ppl asking - Definers shared a narrow document about an anti-Facebook group's funding. It was entirely factual, as Open Markets organizers have acknoweldged they get funding from Soros. I have defended Soros from smears & conspiracies that weren't based in fact. 1/ \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 15, 2018\n\nAll he did was share a document about an anti-Facebook group\u2019s funding \u2014 and a factual document, no less. It\u2019s not his fault the Jews really were behind it!\n\nThe thing is, every group needs funding. It\u2019s unclear why George Soros funding this group, in particular, would have been noteworthy. Unless, of course, you want to make use of the long history of anti-Semitic smears and conspiracies swirling around Soros for political gain. Nothing in Miller\u2019s explanation indicates that he did anything less.\n\nAnd he knew exactly what it was he was doing.\n\nI'm no fan of Soros' politics but the fact that the conservative media is spinning him donating half a billion dollars to support refugees fleeing terror and oppression is a good sign of the moral rot on the right. https://t.co/4HIzgTHLx8 \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 5, 2018\n\nWhere the alt-righters handed out their Protocols of the Elders of Zion pamphlets in public, Miller tried to achieve similar ends with a raised eyebrow behind closed doors. Maybe Miller doesn\u2019t like Trump and his kind because they\u2019re giving the game away.\n\nBut why would a bunch of Obama administration alums even bother with a professional Republican operative in the first place? According to their statement, its because Miller \u201chas interesting things to say about the Republican Party in the Trump era.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see what those interesting things are:\n\n\u201cThe politician x got $ in exchange for dead kids\u201d isn\u2019t just rhetorically out of bounds it is also wrong and counterproductive. Even if you grant that a pol is opposing gun control bc of politics it\u2019s pressure from base *voters* not a few thousand bucks that\u2019s doing it. 1/ \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) March 25, 2018\n\nVery interesting! Unfortunately, it\u2019s also incorrect, or at least it\u2019s defining \u201cbase voters\u201d so narrowly as to render them politically meaningless. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 including a majority of Republicans \u2014 want stricter gun control. But it\u2019s understandable why someone who benefits from politicians raking in piles of toxic cash might want people to believe otherwise.\n\nLet\u2019s see what else he\u2019s got.\n\nThis is a beautiful Heidi ad on her sister's adoption. Think it has hurt national Democrats that most have traded in the \"rare\" and \"life\" parts of the debate in favor of only waving pro-abortion pom poms. https://t.co/sDB3xCFQKs \u2014 Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 19, 2018\n\n\u201cPro-abortion pom poms.\u201d\n\nThe only conceivable reason to ally yourself with someone like Miller is to show the world how tolerant and reasonable you are. In return, the Never Trumpers get even more cash and a crucial credibility boost among liberals and centrists.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Favreau, Lovett and Vietor didn\u2019t know who it was they were boosting. From 2007 to 2009, Miller was a communications strategist at the D.C. public affairs firm Berman and Company, where he also worked as a spokesperson for the Employment Policies Institute, which put out this highly misleading ACORN attack ad. ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, advocated for the poor, helped families navigate federal aid programs and registered people to vote \u2014 until it was brought down by Republican strategists like Miller, working alongside less respectable ratfuckers like James O\u2019Keefe of Project Veritas. According to ProPublica, the Employment Policies Institute also \u201cproduced numerous reports arguing that boosting the minimum wage hurts teen workers and frustrates job creation.\u201d The folks who write the white papers are just ratfuckers who carry briefcases.\n\nIn 2013, Miller helped co-found the GOP opposition group America Rising, a group that put out ads like this:\n\nMiller actively worked to paint Hillary Clinton as a lying thief and to terrify Americans into believing that the only thing standing between them and ISIS was a Republican president. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone that a professional smear man would, as the Times reported yesterday, casually talk about a willingness to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d regarding Facebook\u2019s egregious privacy issues.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), flipped a GOP-held seat in California\u2019s traditionally Republican Orange County.\n\nBecause so many California voters cast their ballots by mail or through absentee voting, the final outcome of the race was decided more than a week after Election Day. Porter initially trailed her opponent, but the ballots counted after Nov. 6 skewed toward her.\n\nPorter benefited from the backlash to President Donald Trump among moderate suburban voters in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District \u2015 one of seven Republican-controlled seats in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nShe ran as an unabashed proponent of Medicare for all, expanded Social Security and tough banking rules, but emphasized issues with broad appeal: the damaging effect of the Republicans\u2019 tax cuts and effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, tougher gun laws and women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cThe electoral tide almost always pulls against the president\u2019s party during his first midterm election, and this year\u2019s tide was especially strong because President Trump has been especially divisive,\u201d said Matthew Beckmann, a political scientist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPorter\u2019s campaign \u2015 focused on unifying Californians and checking President Trump \u2015 was pitch perfect for riding this national wave all the way from a Republican district in California to the seat of power in Washington.\u201d\n\nRELATED COVERAGE An Elizabeth Warren Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Is Defying The Odds In The Cradle Of California Conservatism\n\nPorter, a 44-year-old law professor at UC Irvine, defeated two-term Rep. Mimi Walters (R), 56, a former investment banker who served in House Republican leadership.\n\nWalters, who was registered to vote in another district as recently as June 2017, drew criticism from some constituents for her lack of accessibility and declined to make any joint appearances with Porter.\n\nAnd unlike some other Republicans in vulnerable seats, Walters stuck with Trump on his two major legislative initiatives \u2015 the failed bid to repeal the ACA, as well as the tax cut bill that became law.\n\nAlthough California\u2019s 45th is an affluent district, the tax law\u2019s near-elimination of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction made it a net tax hike for many of the district\u2019s upper-middle-class residents. Porter\u2019s support for reinstating the deduction earned her the backing of the influential California and National Realtors Associations, which spent heavily on her behalf.\n\nPorter also bucked the California Democratic Party by declaring her intention to vote for a ballot initiative repealing a modest gas tax levied by the Democratic-run state government to fund infrastructure improvements. She argued that Orange County residents had already been hit hard by the federal tax law and that infrastructure funds could be secured through other means.\n\nPorter typically eschews labels, but she told HuffPost that she plans to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Medicare for All Caucus. She is critical of some Democrats\u2019 support for legislation that rolled back oversight of many large banks, and said she hopes to serve on committees that allow her to apply her expertise in financial policy.\n\nPorter, who collaborated with Warren in studying the impact of health care costs on household bankruptcies, was one of just two candidates who Warren endorsed in the Democratic primaries. Warren, who cruised to re-election on Nov. 6, was also an early backer of former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray.

Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical. The image of the coat hanger has been supplanted by the image of handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThere is research backing the safety of largely self-managed abortions, although these studies have not necessarily examined the safety of women going it entirely alone. A 2017 investigation found, for example, that abortions are just as safe when managed remotely via telemedicine as they are when a clinician actually watches a woman take the first pill.\n\nWhat this all means for the future of self-managed abortions in the United States is uncertain.\n\nIn an email to HuffPost, the Food and Drug Administration said it \u201ctakes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the U.S. through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of U.S. law.\u201d The FDA said it was unable to discuss potential or pending investigations, if any exist.\n\nA spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the organization does not have an official stance on Aid Access, though it has urged the FDA to remove certain restrictions on where a woman is able to access mifepristone, given the medication\u2019s track record of safety and efficacy. The group has also come out strongly against the criminalization of women who end their pregnancies.\n\nBut the new survey suggests that interest from women is there.\n\n\u201cWe really knew little about the demand for and interest in alternative models (advance provision, online access, and over-the-counter access) of medication abortion provision,\u201d said Biggs, a researcher at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amy Schumer Reveals She's Suffering From Hyperemesis Gravidarum", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-pregnancy-hyperemesis-gravidarum_us_5bedd783e4b0b50c4899ccab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:37", "body_paragraphs": "Amy Schumer\u2019s pregnancy isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nThe comedian, who recently revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child with husband Chris Fischer, told her Instagram followers on Thursday that she\u2019s suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nThe condition, which Kate Middleton also dealt with in all three of her pregnancies, is marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI am in the hospital.

Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research\n\nFor example, at least 40 pharmacists in Texas thought that they could only dispense naloxone without a prescription if a patient was actively overdosing, which Kirk Evoy, lead author of the Texas research and a clinical assistant professor the University of Texas at Austin called \u201can especially alarming finding.\u201d If someone overdoses and there\u2019s no naloxone on hand, the correct response is to call 911, not travel to a pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue our efforts to educate and support pharmacists,\u201d said Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research and an associate professor of clinical sciences at Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.\n\nIn California, some pharmacists weren\u2019t stocking naloxone because few customers were requesting it and not many doctors were prescribing it, leading to a circular pattern of deprioritizing the drug.\n\nPuzantian pointed to the pharmacists\u2019 successful public health efforts to immunize their communities against the flu as a good model, and noted that because of their access to patient information about overdose risk, pharmacists were \u201cwell poised\u201d to help fight the opioid epidemic.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has called for a two-day advisory committee meeting to improve Americans\u2019 access to naloxone in December.\n\nIn the meantime, 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, with nearly 50,000 of those deaths attributable to opioids, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNaloxone in pharmacies remains unreliable even in areas in which there\u2019s been a concerted effort to expand access.\n\nIn New York City, where 1,374 people died of drug overdoses in 2016, the health department\u2019s \u201cI Saved A Life\u201d naloxone awareness campaign directed New Yorkers to more than 700 pharmacies in the city that dispense naloxone without a prescription.\n\nA New York Times examination into that list, however, found that that less than a third of those pharmacies had naloxone on hand and would distribute it without a prescription.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "Prosecutors Have Prepared Indictment of Julian Assange, a Filing Reveals", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/julian-assange-indictment-wikileaks.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "A Justice Department spokesman declined to say on Thursday what led to the inadvertent disclosure. It was made in a recently unsealed filing in an apparently unrelated sex-crimes case charging a man named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi with coercing and enticing an underage person to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Mr. Kokayi was charged in early August, and on Aug. 22, prosecutors filed a three-page document laying out boilerplate arguments for why his case at that time needed to remain sealed.\n\nWhile the filing started out referencing Mr. Kokayi, federal prosecutors abruptly switched on its second page to discussing the fact that someone named \u201cAssange\u201d had been secretly indicted, and went on to make clear that this person was the subject of significant publicity, lived abroad and would need to be extradited \u2014 suggesting that prosecutors had inadvertently pasted text from a similar court filing into the wrong document and then filed it.\n\n\u201cAnother procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because, due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThey added, \u201cThe complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order, would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has been studying whether or how to charge Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks with some kind of criminal offense since the site began publishing its trove of secret military and diplomatic documents. Prosecutors, for example, toyed with the idea of charging Mr. Assange as a conspirator in Ms. Manning\u2019s crime of unauthorized disclosure of secrets related to national defense. And it eventually became public that a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia was investigating people with links to WikiLeaks.\n\nBut even as the Obama administration brought criminal charges in an unprecedented number of leak-related cases, it apparently held back from charging Mr. Assange. Members of the Obama legal policy team from that era have said that they did not want to establish a precedent that could chill investigative reporting about national security matters by treating it as a crime.\n\nTheir dilemma came down to a question they found no clear answer to: Is there any legal difference between what WikiLeaks was doing, at least in that era, from what traditional news media organizations, like The New York Times, do in soliciting and publishing information they obtain that the government wants to keep secret?"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West\u2019s Secrets", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/world/europe/wikileaks-julian-assange-russia.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Julian Assange was in classic didactic form, holding forth on the topic that consumes him \u2014 the perfidy of big government and especially of the United States.\n\nMr. Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, rose to global fame in 2010 for releasing huge caches of highly classified American government communications that exposed the underbelly of its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and its sometimes cynical diplomatic maneuvering around the world. But in a televised interview last September, it was clear that he still had plenty to say about \u201cThe World According to US Empire,\u201d the subtitle of his latest book, \u201cThe WikiLeaks Files.\u201d\n\nFrom the cramped confines of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum four years ago amid a legal imbroglio, Mr. Assange proffered a vision of America as superbully: a nation that has achieved imperial power by proclaiming allegiance to principles of human rights while deploying its military-intelligence apparatus in \u201cpincer\u201d formation to \u201cpush\u201d countries into doing its bidding, and punishing people like him who dare to speak the truth.\n\nNotably absent from Mr. Assange\u2019s analysis, however, was criticism of another world power, Russia, or its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has hardly lived up to WikiLeaks\u2019 ideal of transparency. Mr. Putin\u2019s government has cracked down hard on dissent \u2014 spying on, jailing, and, critics charge, sometimes assassinating opponents while consolidating control over the news media and internet.

Almost four million votes later, it is clear that the polls were correct.\n\nThe Republican nominee, Brian Kemp, leads his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, by about 55,000 votes. Democrats do not expect to pick up all of those votes; instead, they are hoping to gain about 17,800 votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff, or the roughly 15,400 they need to set off a recount.\n\nThe Abrams campaign, citing the extensive litigation and Georgia\u2019s patchwork of elections procedures, has been adamant that it believes there are enough pending ballots to lead to a runoff. Mr. Kemp\u2019s campaign has asserted that he has an \u201cinsurmountable lead.\u201d\n\nFederal judges loom large\n\nThe courts have been considering Georgia\u2019s voting system since well before the first general election ballots were cast. But in the aftermath of Election Day, federal judges have been among the most important figures in determining which ballots are counted and how quickly elections officials can carry out some of their duties.\n\nThe most consequential ruling, at least in terms of setting a timeline for the race, came late on Monday, when a judge in Atlanta ruled that the secretary of state could not certify the election results until at least Friday at 5 p.m. (The state had been expected to finalize the outcome on Wednesday.)"}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml", "title": "As Pelosi Pushes to Become Speaker, Gender Debate Becomes Charged", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/us/politics/pelosi-house-speaker.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:40", "body_paragraphs": "\u201cBut people in my district on both sides of the aisle feel that it\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership,\u201d Ms. Slotkin went on. \u201cFor me, what\u2019s most important for my district is someone who\u2019s talking about kitchen table issues.

It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: \u201cYou need to limit fats to avoid extra calories,\u201d it states.\n\nBut experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.\n\nDr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been \u201cexperimentally falsified\u201d in rigorous studies.\n\nDr. Hall published a meta-analysis of feeding studies last year that suggested that energy expenditure was actually slightly greater on low-fat diets. But Dr. Ludwig pointed out that those studies were very short, with none lasting longer than a month and most lasting a week or less. He said the process of adapting to a low-carb diet can take a month or longer.\n\n\u201cA few days, or a couple weeks, is not enough time to make any meaningful conclusion about how diets affect metabolism over the long term,\u201d he added."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "What to Know About Getting a Flu Shot This Year, No Matter Who\u2019s Paying", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/your-money/flu-shot-options.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-11-16 09:01:45", "body_paragraphs": "When I went to a pharmacy in Brooklyn to get a flu shot last year, I was presented with a choice: one vaccine with three different strains of the flu virus for about $30 or, for just $10 more, four strains. It sounded vaguely like a late-night television infomercial.\n\nI stood at the counter, confused. Didn\u2019t I want every strain? I thought that one new vaccine was developed each year and that it was more effective some years than others. What was I missing?\n\nAs it turns out, the choice I was given was not unusual . Until a few years ago, the typical flu shot included three strains of the virus in what is known as a trivalent vaccine: two strains of influenza A, one of influenza B. Now, more flu-shot makers are adding a second B strain to create a so-called quadrivalent vaccine that provides a bit more protection.\n\nThe more strains the better, right? I paid for the additional B strain. The vaccine experts I spoke with later said that was a good choice for me, but that didn\u2019t mean it would be better for everyone based on what\u2019s available now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it did not prefer one vaccine over another. Its guidelines are based largely on age and other characteristics (like pregnancy or chronic illness)."}]
