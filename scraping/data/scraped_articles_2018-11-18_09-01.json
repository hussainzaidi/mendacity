Cindy Hyde-Smith, said she'd attend a \"public hanging\" if invited by a supporter, and that suppressing the votes of college students might be a \"good thing.\"\n\nOn defense, Hyde-Smith called the comment about attending a public hanging \"an exaggerated expression of regard.\" Her campaign said she was \"making a joke\" when, in front of a group that included students at Mississippi State University, she praised the idea of making it \"just a little more difficult\" for \"liberal folks in those other schools\" to vote.\n\nBut Democrats saw an opening.\n\nLast year, in another runoff special Senate election in Alabama, a surge of African-American turnout led to a stunning victory for Democrat Doug Jones over Republican Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexually molesting and assaulting teenage girls.\n\nThe allegations gave voters in the state who don't typically support Democrats something to vote against.\n\nEspy, a 64-year-old former congressman and agriculture secretary, now hopes Hyde-Smith's comments will similarly turbocharge turnout and tilt voters in the November 27 runoff against her.\n\n\"Here's what you're not going to get from me: You're not going to hear any talk about voter suppression. You're not going to hear any talk about public hanging,\" Espy told more than 100 women gathered at a hotel here on Saturday morning. Instead, Espy said, he would focus on education, gender equity and health care.\n\nHe said his election would reflect \"a Mississippi that's moving forward, a Mississippi with a better image.\"\n\nEspy told the group of mostly black women that Jones had won in Alabama because of support from women.\n\n\"What that did for Doug Jones in Alabama, you've got to do for me in Mississippi, you know what I'm saying?\" he said.\n\nNationally known Democrats -- aware that the state holds an early primary that could be key in the Democratic presidential nominating process -- are also flocking to Mississippi to campaign with Espy.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris campaigned with Espy on Saturday, telling the crowd at the hotel to \"make a point about who we are as a country, symbolized by what the state of Mississippi is.\"\n\nAsked about Hyde-Smith's comments after Saturday's event, Harris called them \"harmful and hurtful\" as well as \"neglectful of understanding what those words mean in historical context.\"\n\nAnother potential 2020 presidential candidate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, will travel to Mississippi on Monday.\n\n'The ingredients are present'\n\nMississippi is a long shot for Democrats -- but it's not impossible.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump won the state by 18 percentage points. That's a blowout, but it's still closer than the margins were in other red states like Indiana and Missouri.\n\nThe state's elected attorney general, Jim Hood, is a Democrat, though a conservative one who downplays his party ties -- and he's running for governor in 2019.\n\nNearly 40% of Mississippi's population is black, and those that turn out to vote do so overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates.\n\nAnd the mayor of Jackson, 35-year-old Chokwe Lumumba, is seen nationally as a rising progressive star.\n\n\"The ingredients are present,\" Lumumba said in an interview. \"You have people that want something different. And I think you have a population that feels unsatisfied with the results.\"\n\nStill, to win the Senate runoff, Espy must walk a tightrope, overperforming among African-American voters and college students in the state's urban areas in a runoff being held on the Tuesday after the Thanksgiving weekend while also winning a share of voters who typically back Republicans. It's difficult to do both.\n\n\"We need to be as radical or progressive as the circumstances dictate we should be,\" Lumumba said. \"If you say yes to everyone, then ultimately you say no to everyone. If you play the middle in that regard, then no one feels organized, no one feels engaged.\"\n\nNational parties jockeying\n\nNational Democrats say the results in Alabama give them hope, but that Mississippi is even more difficult than some other deep red-state battles Democrats have won over the last two years. The party is likely to follow the same path it used in other states and districts typically hostile to Democrats, shielding its involvement through maneuvers like funding obscurely named super PACs.\n\nIf any Democrat has a chance of producing a Doug Jones-style overperformance among African-American voters, where they make up more of the electorate than they do the population, it's Espy, one national Democratic operative said.\n\n\"It's a hard race in a hard place, and we'd need to catch all the breaks,\" the operative said.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are working to avoid another embarrassing loss in the Deep South.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee -- the Senate GOP's campaign arm -- is also spending $1.1 million on an ad that highlights Espy's work as a lobbyist and casts him as part of the DC \"swamp.\"\n\nAnd Trump will campaign for Hyde-Smith the evening before the election, with stops planned in Tupelo and Biloxi, Trump's campaign announced Saturday.\n\nThe President's visit \"will be a good boost to make sure all conservatives know they have a very clear choice in this runoff election,\" Hyde-Smith said in a statement.\n\nHer campaign said she was unavailable for an interview this week. She was in Washington, with the Senate in session.\n\nBacklash over Hyde-Smith's comments\n\nThe controversy over Hyde-Smith's comments about a \"public hanging\" continues to spark backlash against her campaign in Mississippi, a state where the Confederate flag remains a part of the state flag.\n\nMore than 10,000 people signed a petition calling for her removal from office created by Mississippi Matters, a coalition of progressive groups.\n\nThe group held a protest Friday outside Hyde-Smith's office in Jackson. On Sunday, Jackson City Council member Aaron Banks organized rally against \"hate and racism\" at the state Capitol.\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign, meanwhile, sought to defuse the controversy over the newer video, in which she calls it a \"good idea\" to make it harder for college students to vote, with a tweet in which she is seen at the same event where the video was recorded laughing with two students -- one of whom is black.\n\n\"It's ok to still have a sense of humor in America isn't it?\" the tweet posted to Hyde-Smith's account said. \"These students enjoyed a laugh with Cindy despite out of state social media posts trying to mislead Mississippians.\"\n\nOn Friday evening, the black student in the picture, J.R. Coleman, took to Twitter with scathing criticism of Hyde-Smith's campaign over its use of the photo.\n\n\"As a Political Science major I want to understand and inform myself about every candidate. But I do not, however, support Cindy Hyde Smith. I am disgusted. The sole purpose of this picture being posted is because I am black,\" he said.\n\nIn another tweet, Coleman added, \"She is attempting to show herself in a different light by using this photo of me. We were not laughing in regards to her terrible statements, and I don't appreciate this post trying to make it seem so.\"\n\nShe is attempting to show herself in a different light by using this photo of me. We were not laughing in regards to her terrible statements, and I don't appreciate this post trying to make it seem so. \u2014 JR Coleman (@JR__Coleman) November 16, 2018\n\nHyde-Smith's campaign deleted its tweet with the photo that included Coleman."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Gillum concedes Florida governor's race to DeSantis", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/G-mCOAfkrEU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) Andrew Gillum, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida, conceded to his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, ending a protracted fight that saw the Tallahassee mayor take back his Election Day concession during a statewide recount.\n\nThe concession ended Gillum's first bid for statewide office in Florida, but the run -- despite his loss -- vaulted the 39-year old politician into the upper echelons of Democratic politics.\n\n\"R. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum said in a Facebook video in which he appeared alongside his wife. \"This has been the journey of our lives.\"\n\nDeSantis responded to Gillum's concession with a call for unity.\n\n\"This was a hard-fought campaign,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Now it's time to bring Florida together.\"\n\nThe reality, however, is that the race between DeSantis and Gillum was anything but unifying. The contest was a heated affair that largely reflected the broader national tensions over race and class in the Trump era.\n\nThose issues, which were already bubbling up throughout the primary, were escalated by DeSantis when he went on Fox News a day after the primary to warn Florida voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. DeSantis denied there was any racial innuendo in his remark, but race -- and allegations that DeSantis was using it against his opponent -- were never far off during the 10-week general election sprint.\n\nThey hit a boiling point during the pair's second and final debate. DeSantis loudly objected to suggestions he was in cahoots with far-right figures or that his ties -- unwitting, he said -- to white supremacists should be held against him.\n\n\"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\" Gillum said in response. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nIf that line earned Gillum viral praise and national recognition, his indirect connections to an FBI investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee was a drag on his campaign, which at times struggled to explain Gillum's relationship with a former lobbyist and friend and his run-ins with an undercover federal agent. Gillum maintained throughout the campaign that the FBI told him he was not a target of the probe, which could continue to dog him in the coming months or years.\n\nDeSantis has largely flown under the radar since Election Day. The conservative lawmaker began to put together a gubernatorial transition shortly after Election Day despite the ongoing recount.\n\nGillum, after conceding the race on Election Night, took back his concession as late-counted ballots brought the race within just over 33,000 votes.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" he said, after Florida election officials ordered a recount in three statewide contests.\n\nGillum's race all but ended on Thursday, however, when the machine portion of the recount ended and DeSantis lost only one vote on the Tallahassee mayor. Because Gillum's race did not fall within the .25% standard that automatically triggers a manual recount, there was nowhere near the number of votes need for Gillum to close the gap.\n\nThe state's Senate race, between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and Florida's race for agriculture commissioner did fall within that margin and are currently in the midst of a hand recount.\n\nGillum's fight during the recount, however, became bigger than just winning the race. He and other Democrats repeatedly said they were sticking with the campaign until all legally cast votes were counted. Lawyers for Democratic interests, including Nelson's campaign, looked to expand the number of available votes in federal court by overturning a series of Florida election laws, but those efforts largely failed.\n\nGillum or his campaign were not party to any of those suits, but he could have stood to benefit from them.\n\nGillum acknowledged this fight in his concession video.\n\n\"This was not just about an election cycle, this was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up against in our government,\" Gillum said. \"We know that this fight continues.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Andrew Gillum responds to Trump's 'thief' comment", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/jjZzyNA78G8/andrew-gillum-responds-to-trump-thief-comment-sot-ip-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The frigate, which was returning from NATO's Trident Juncture exercises, was evacuated after the collision with the Sola TS tanker, Norway's army said.\n\nNorway's military has remained tight lipped about the situation, which injured eight of the 137 people on board. Navy communications officer Torill Herland told CNN that whatever occurred during the accident near Bergen is now \"police work.\"\n\nA joint Norwegian and Maltese investigation is now also underway to try and determine the cause.\n\nSimilar cases involving US Navy destroyers over the last two years were found to have been down to avoidable errors, according to Alex Pape, Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, but he said it is too early to speculate on this incident.\n\n\"Warships, particularly surface combatants like frigates, are generally designed to withstand a degree of battle damage,\" Pape told CNN.\n\n\"However, even for well protected warships, if they sustain sufficient damage, particularly in adjacent compartments and below the waterline, the resulting flooding may be too much for pumps and/or the crew's damage control efforts to cope with, and the ship will list, capsize or sink.\n\nPape said this particular incident suggests that in addition to a visible large hole torn in the starboard side, there is substantial damage to the hull near or below the waterline, which then rapidly flooded the aft compartments of the ship.\n\nHeavy chains\n\nThe attempted rescue of the frigate has certainly raised eyebrows.\n\nJan Vindenes is the general manager of Sotra Anchor & Chain, whose products have been used in numerous shipwreck recoveries, including that of the Costa Concordia -- the cruise ship which crashed into rocks off the coast of Italy in 2012, killing 32 people on board.

But the country's military will have to carefully consider the cost of salvaging and repairing it for active service.\n\nPape told CNN: \"Curiously, if the ship is not repaired, the reduction of one ship that needs to be maintained, upgraded, manned and used over the remaining 20 years of its life will mean that cost for the navy could go down in the long run, however with a loss of capability.\"\n\nPape estimates that a decision to salvage it, repair it, and return it to service would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \"The total cost could be similar to the cost of a new ship.\"\n\nThe financial impact of the crash is likely to be felt well beyond the military, as it triggered the shutdown of a North Sea crude export terminal, Norway's largest gas processing plant and several offshore fields.\n\nIn total, these five oil and gas fields produce around 400 million Norwegian krone ($48 million) a day or 17 million krone ($2 million) an hour. Since the oil companies pay 78 percent taxes to the state for production, the two-day shutdown ultimately resulted in a substantial economic loss for the nation, national broadcaster NRK reported.\n\nFortunately the oil tanker -- which was carrying almost 100 million liters of oil -- was not seriously damaged in the accident. The Norwegian Coastal Administration said it had cleaned up some diesel and helicopter fuel that was spilled in the incident, but that has been largely contained, according to Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway.\n\n\"A major leakage would have constituted an unbelievable environmental disaster that easily could have impacted most of Norway's western coastline,\" Gulowsen told CNN.\n\nThe crash led to a small amount of diesel and 10,000 liters of helicopter fuel to leak from the vessel, which has largely been contained and recovered, he said.\n\nGulowsen added however that, \"the situation is not yet stable and the vessel is still under water.

The short circuit was caused by seawater entering the vessel's \"snorkel,\" a tube that reaches the surface to refresh the vessel's air and recharge the batteries, the captain said in a call to his commander on land.\n\nDays later, it emerged that a sound consistent with an explosion had been detected in the ocean near the sub's last known location by the United States and an international nuclear weapons monitor.\n\nThe hunt for the vessel -- which at its height involved 28 ships and nine airplanes from 11 nations, including the United States and United Kingdom -- centered on an area roughly 900 kilometers (559 miles) off the Argentine coast.\n\nRelatives of crew members prayed for their return in Mar del Plata even as hopes dwindled that the diesel-powered submarine would be found before the air supply ran out.\n\nThe Argentine navy called off its rescue operation about two weeks after the sub's disappearance, saying there was \"no chance of survival\" for its crew, but search efforts continued.\n\nAmong those lost was Eliana Maria Krawczyk, Argentina's first female submarine officer.\n\nArgentina's first female submarine officer, Eliana Krawczyk, was among the crew of the ARA San Juan.\n\nthe firm said.

The company confirmed it has the ability to salvage remains of the submarine should the Argentines ask.\n\n\"Next steps are a matter for the authorities to determine,\" Plunkett said. \"We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation, but at the moment, we are focused on completing imaging of the debris field.\"\n\nThe ARA San Juan was an old diesel submarine, built in Germany in the mid-1980s but was refitted with new engines and batteries around five years before its disappearance, Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University in Australia, told CNN last year\n\nThe sub was designed to have a shelf life of around 30 years, which had expired, he said. If intact after the explosion, the hull could have been expected to withstand ocean depths up to around 500 to 600 meters, he said. Below that, it would buckle under pressure."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "Climate protests shut down five London bridges", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/G0FfuRWzjZM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:06", "body_paragraphs": "London (CNN) Bridges in London were forced to close Saturday because of protests against climate change organized by a group called Extinction Rebellion, city transport agency Transport for London (TfL) said on Twitter.\n\nThe group have occupied five bridges across the English capital -- Westminster, Lambeth, Waterloo, Blackfriars and Southwark Bridge -- on what they call \"Rebellion Day\" to protest against the British government's \"criminal inaction\" on climate change.\n\n\"Extinction Rebellion demands that the UK government immediately tells the truth and declares a climate and ecological emergency, that it reverses inconsistent policies and reduces to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, and creates a citizen's assembly to oversee these changes,\" the group said on Saturday.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan \"fully respects\" the right to protest peacefully, but it \"must be within the boundaries of law,\" according to his spokesman.\n\nKhan's spokesman agreed with protesters that action on climate change is \"urgently\" required, adding it was \"high time ministers stopped dragging their feet\" over the \"vitally important\" issue.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "As the fire neared, this 93-year-old knew she had to get out.

And when Newsum went to call for help, her electricity shut off and phone service went down.\n\nSo she got her medicine and other vital needs together and walked out of her home in Magalia, California, hoping somebody would come by and help her. Salvation soon came in the form of a garbage truck.\n\n\"I was standing there when I looked up and saw this great, big, green monster truck barreling down the street,\" Newsum told CNN.\n\nAround that time, Dane Ray Cummings, a Waste Management driver, had been told to cut his trash collection route short and head home as the Camp Fire neared. But he wanted to finish his route, and he had a mind to check on some houses with elderly or disabled residents.\n\nCummings drove up to find Newsum waiting for him. And once he realized she needed to evacuate, he knew what he had to do.\n\n\"He said you're going with me,\" Newsum recalled.\n\nMargaret Newsum, 93, got a ride from garbage collector Dane Ray Cummings to escape the Camp Fire.\n\nCummings' rescue of Newsum is just one of a number of tales of citizens helping others out during the California wildfires that have killed at least 74 people statewide. The Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in state history, has destroyed most of Paradise, a town near Magalia, causing widespread evacuations and smog across Northern California.\n\nA long journey to safety\n\nThe fire stopped before it reached Newsum's home, but she and Cummings didn't know that at the time.\n\nNewsum recently broke her back and uses a walker to get around, which made it tricky to get up into the cab of his garbage truck. Cummings and some neighbors lifted her up and buckled her in, and they strapped her walker to the side of the truck.\n\nWith thousands trying to flee at the same time, the trip was slow going, they said.\n\n\"He got in the truck and away we went. It was stop, go, stop, go,\" Newsum said. \"We were on the road about 5\u00bd hours. When we started coming down out of the hill, the smoke was so bad, it was like going into the bowels of hell. It was so black. I've never seen smoke that black before. It was frightening.\"\n\nOn the ride, Cummings called up childhood friend and co-worker Brian Harrison, a heavy equipment technician for Waste Management.\n\n\"He says, 'Brian, you are not gonna believe what I have in my truck,' \" Harrison told CNN.\n\nThey weren't sure what to do with Newsum, but Harrison knew an evacuation center was no place for a 93-year-old.\n\n\"I said Dane, 'This is a no-brainer. I'm just gonna take her home,' \" he said. \"It's just the right thing to do.\"\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California From left, California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, California Gov.

Thousands of survivors are sleeping in overcrowded shelters, cars and makeshift tent cities not knowing what their future holds.\n\nRescue personnel are sifting through the wreckage in search of human remains. The list of missing has grown to more than 1,000 names as officials struggle to provide answers to loved ones.\n\nThe devastating human toll\n\nWhat was once Paradise is no more.\n\n\"A whole town was wiped off the face of the Earth in a matter of eight hours,\" resident Cole Wyatt said.\n\nMany in the town of 27,000 in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada fled with nothing more than a change of clothes.

We, like so many other families, have nothing left. I don't even have words to describe what my family has gone through this week.\"\n\nGrim search for the dead, hope for the missing\n\nThe number of people reported missing in the Camp Fire soared Friday to 1,011.\n\nInvestigators are trying to track down everyone on the list of missing by checking with those who called 911 to verify they've made contact with their loved ones. If people find their names on the list, or names of loved ones they know are safe, they're asked to call the Butte County Sheriff's Office.\n\nTape outlines the location where deputies recovered the body of a Camp Fire victim Wednesday.\n\nBut with each day that goes by, more human remains are pulled from the ashes and rubble. Some are so badly burned, they are unrecognizable.\n\nSol Bechtold drove three hours from the San Francisco Bay Area to provide authorities with a DNA sample after he could not reach his mother.\n\n\"I will do anything to find my mother,\" he said. \"I realize the outcome I pray for may not be the one I ultimately get.\"\n\nUnfortunately, he later received word that his mother, Joanne Caddy, had died in the Camp Fire.\n\nMany looking for their loved ones are calling people who live in the same neighborhoods, going to area hospitals, joining Facebook groups and putting up flyers with photos at shelters.\n\n\"We're desperate to find an answer,\" said Delbert Mack, who is searching for his sister Dorothy Lee Mack. \"Everyone in the family is anxious. And they're expecting me to give them positive information. I have no information to give them.\"\n\nSmoke and virus outbreak among health risks\n\nIn the wake of the fire, some residents are facing health-related issues. A fast-spreading norovirus outbreak has left 145 people ill with vomiting and diarrhea at four evacuee shelters since they opened, the Butte County Public Health Department said.\n\n\"The number of sick people is increasing every day,\" the department said . As of Wednesday, 41 out of the more than 800 evacuees staying in shelters had symptoms.\n\nTo fight the outbreak, health officials say they are creating separate shelter areas for sick evacuees, additional cleaning of the shelters and providing staff with protective equipment to minimize exposure.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California From left, California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, California Gov.

Hide Caption 98 of 98\n\nMore than 100 miles from Paradise, air quality has deteriorated to unhealthy levels due to the smoke from the Camp Fire.\n\nDozens of the Bay Area's K-12 schools and universities canceled classes this week, and Saturday's Big Game between California and Stanford has been rescheduled for December 1. The popular college football game has been postponed only once before in 55 years, a week after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nA dangerous mix fueled the fires\n\nThe Camp and Woolsey fires both began November 8 at a time when a dangerous mix of powerful winds, lack of rain and severe dry conditions created extremely favorable conditions for new wildfires to begin. Those conditions fiercely fed the fires for days and has kept firefighters struggling to contain them.\n\nAt its fastest, the Camp Fire burned an area equivalent to the size of a football field every second, devouring virtually everything in its path.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire also grew quickly as it threatened parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties and claimed three lives.\n\nMore than half of California is in a moderate drought or worse, and 18% of the state, including the area near the Woolsey Fire, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor\n\nOver the past month, much of the state has received less than 5% of its normal rainfall.\n\nIn Northern California, usually a series of storms would have dampened the woods and brush by now, but it hasn't rained much this fall, said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior analyst for Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nSome experts say climate change has created the conditions conducive to feeding fires -- such as drier air and plant life, contributing to more days of extreme fires.\n\nCalifornia's fourth climate change assessment, issued in August, said the state's forests will become more vulnerable to wildfires because of climate change. The assessment says that by 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77%.\n\nFirefighters battling the blazes in Northern and Southern California may get some relief in the coming week.\n\nForecasts show the West Coast will see a series of storms arriving, starting Monday. Heavier, steadier rain is expected Wednesday, with another round likely just after Thanksgiving."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Trump: Not raking weeds contributing to fires", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/3OhwJ_XYfWA/trump-leaves-wildfires-fox-intv-sot-newday-vpx.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "In an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump suggests poor land management is more to blame for raging wildfires in California than climate change."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "At least 71 people are dead and more than 1,000 are missing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/MzQF7GuEjwU/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The task is painstaking and painful. A searcher is given the name of someone who is unaccounted for and an address.\n\nA team heads over to the property, more than likely one where every evidence of life has been wiped out by flames. Many of the searchers are local and have lost their own homes. Now they look to see whether they can find the remains of their neighbors.\n\nFive more sets of remains were found Saturday, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said.\n\nThere are now at least 76 dead from the Camp Fire, which has obliterated more structures and lives than any previous fire in California.\n\nAlmost all of the town of Paradise is gone. President Donald Trump witnessed the devastation for himself Saturday, accompanied by Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"We're all going to work together and we'll do a real job, but this is very sad to see,\" Trump said.\n\nA list of people unaccounted for has almost 1,300 names on it. Officials hope they find those people at shelters, or that missing people were simply without phone service and will eventually call in, or that they will figure out duplicate names when reconciling the list.\n\nThey are also trying to help thousands of people who did make it out alive but have nowhere to go, except for the parking lot of a Walmart and other places that are hosting thousands in their vehicles and tents.\n\n\"It is overwhelming, I don't have any word to describe it,\" Honea told CNN on Saturday. \"This is unprecedented. No one has had to deal with this magnitude that caused so much destruction and regrettably so much death.\"\n\nThe deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire has destroyed more than 9,800 homes and scorched 149,000 acres since starting November 8. It was 55% contained as of Saturday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, three deaths have been reported in the Woolsey Fire in Southern California, bringing the statewide death toll from the wildfires to 79.\n\nSearchers work at a property in Paradise where human remains were found Friday.\n\n'A lot of people don't know ... we're looking for them'\n\nEven as the list of those missing in the Camp Fire has ballooned, it's hard to tell exactly how many people truly are lost, officials have said.\n\n\"That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls, emails and the 911 system,\" Honea said Saturday. \"It's not perfect data, but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection, we're trying to get some progress going.\"\n\nHundreds of deputies, National Guard troops, coroners and anthropologists are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains. While the focus is on the homes of people reported missing, some teams are going down streets from one property to the next.\n\n\"I want you to understand that there are a lot of people displaced, and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them,\" the sheriff said.\n\nIf people find their own or loved ones' names on the list at the Butte County Sheriff's Office's website , they should call the sheriff's office, Honea said.\n\nIn the midst of despair, hope remains. The mayor of Paradise told CNN Saturday that she is committed to rebuilding her town, as is the town council.\n\n\"Paradise is not gone,\" Jody Jones said, citing a friend's Facebook post. \"It's just closed for remodeling.\"\n\nSome heroes drive garbage trucks\n\nMargaret Newsum gathered her medicine and other vital supplies and went outside her home in Magalia as the Camp Fire roared toward her home.\n\nShe had no phone service and no electricity, and she was just hoping someone would see her and come help.\n\n\"He said, you're going with me,\" Newsum, 93, recalled.\n\nNewsum recently broke her back and uses a walker to get around, which made it tricky to get up into the cab of his garbage truck. Cummings and some neighbors lifted her up and buckled her in, and they strapped her walker to the side of the truck.\n\nHarrison, a single father, decided Newsum shouldn't go to an evacuation center so instead he took her home with him.\n\nAnd she'll be there a while. Newsum's home wasn't destroyed, but it might be months before she can live there again.\n\nEscape took them through ditches, front yards\n\nWith each day another story comes that makes it clearer how chaotic it was on the flame-filled and smoky day that the fire erupted.\n\nDan Newman, a team captain with the Butte County Sheriff's search and rescue team, said he originally was tasked with going door to door to alert people in the community of Concow to the fire.\n\nThe mission quickly changed to go to Paradise, about a 20-mile drive away, where a hospital was in danger.\n\n\"When we arrived at the hospital there were already flames, and all of a sudden the urgency just skyrocketed,\" he said.\n\nHis team went around to the ER entrance and threw four patients in its truck.\n\nA hospital evacuation involved every kind of vehicle -- ambulances, police cars, buses, personal cars.\n\nThe road that went by the hospital was swamped with cars and accidents. Drivers used every bit of open space they could, including ditches and racing through front yards, to get by.\n\nThe fire was faster than any vehicle was moving.\n\n\"We had homes on fire on each side,\" he said, adding that there were times when he feared for their lives.\n\nThey got out, but another team couldn't and ended up back at the hospital.\n\n3 deaths in Southern California\n\nThe Woolsey Fire burning in Southern California has destroyed 836 structures in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, Cal Fire said.\n\nMore than 98,000 acres have been burned since the blaze began November 8, while evacuees remain in shelters, and portions of Malibu and nearby areas must be rebuilt, officials said. It was 82% contained on Saturday morning, Cal Fire reported.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California From left, California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, California Gov.

He called the situation \"an air quality emergency,\" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution.\n\n\"We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health,\" said Dr. Daniel Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. \"But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires.\"\n\nSome call cancellations 'too little, too late'\n\nSan Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets , several schools have canceled classes, and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.\n\nPublic schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday, along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote. Some students, even those without pre-existing conditions, said they felt sick.\n\n\"I had a bloody throat, bloody nose, a cough, dry and watering eyes, and my throat is still very sore and dry,\" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. \"I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered, though, people can \"reduce their PM exposure by about 90%\" by being inside, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you have to go outside, Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator, a specially designed mask that provides \"very efficient filtration of airborne particles\" when worn correctly, according to the Food and Drug Administration\n\nThe agency warns that \"a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair,\" which means the masks \"may not provide full protection\" for those people.\n\nBut even if you are able to protect your lungs, Jaffe said, diminished air quality can be demoralizing. \"There's a mental health issue too,\" he said. \"Everybody is unhappy, and it's hard to enjoy life.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump says 'good time' for a government shutdown if no money for border wall", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/H3OuHfYcowM/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Saturday that this would be a \"good time\" for a government shutdown if he doesn't get funding from Congress for his border wall.\n\n\"I think probably, if I was ever going to do a shutdown over border security, when you look at the caravans, when you look at the mess, when you look at the people coming in, this would be a very good time to do a shutdown,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump added, however, that he didn't think a shutdown would \"be necessary, because I think the Democrats will come to their senses.\"\n\nCongress averted a government shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government.

Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, ending a protracted fight that saw the Tallahassee mayor take back his Election Day concession during a statewide recount.\n\nThe concession ended Gillum's first bid for statewide office in Florida, but the run -- despite his loss -- vaulted the 39-year old politician into the upper echelons of Democratic politics.\n\n\"R. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum said in a Facebook video in which he appeared alongside his wife. \"This has been the journey of our lives.\"\n\nDeSantis responded to Gillum's concession with a call for unity.\n\n\"This was a hard-fought campaign,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Now it's time to bring Florida together.\"\n\nThe reality, however, is that the race between DeSantis and Gillum was anything but unifying. The contest was a heated affair that largely reflected the broader national tensions over race and class in the Trump era.\n\nThose issues, which were already bubbling up throughout the primary, were escalated by DeSantis when he went on Fox News a day after the primary to warn Florida voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. DeSantis denied there was any racial innuendo in his remark, but race -- and allegations that DeSantis was using it against his opponent -- were never far off during the 10-week general election sprint.\n\nThey hit a boiling point during the pair's second and final debate. DeSantis loudly objected to suggestions he was in cahoots with far-right figures or that his ties -- unwitting, he said -- to white supremacists should be held against him.\n\n\"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\" Gillum said in response. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nIf that line earned Gillum viral praise and national recognition, his indirect connections to an FBI investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee was a drag on his campaign, which at times struggled to explain Gillum's relationship with a former lobbyist and friend and his run-ins with an undercover federal agent. Gillum maintained throughout the campaign that the FBI told him he was not a target of the probe, which could continue to dog him in the coming months or years.\n\nDeSantis has largely flown under the radar since Election Day. The conservative lawmaker began to put together a gubernatorial transition shortly after Election Day despite the ongoing recount.\n\nGillum, after conceding the race on Election Night, took back his concession as late-counted ballots brought the race within just over 33,000 votes.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" he said, after Florida election officials ordered a recount in three statewide contests.\n\nGillum's race all but ended on Thursday, however, when the machine portion of the recount ended and DeSantis lost only one vote on the Tallahassee mayor. Because Gillum's race did not fall within the .25% standard that automatically triggers a manual recount, there was nowhere near the number of votes need for Gillum to close the gap.\n\nThe state's Senate race, between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and Florida's race for agriculture commissioner did fall within that margin and are currently in the midst of a hand recount.\n\nGillum's fight during the recount, however, became bigger than just winning the race. He and other Democrats repeatedly said they were sticking with the campaign until all legally cast votes were counted. Lawyers for Democratic interests, including Nelson's campaign, looked to expand the number of available votes in federal court by overturning a series of Florida election laws, but those efforts largely failed.\n\nGillum or his campaign were not party to any of those suits, but he could have stood to benefit from them.\n\nGillum acknowledged this fight in his concession video.\n\n\"This was not just about an election cycle, this was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up against in our government,\" Gillum said. \"We know that this fight continues.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Who is Marcia Fudge, the Democrat considering challenging Nancy Pelosi for House speaker?", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/Qv8Z7GH94Mg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi continues to project confidence that she will be elected speaker of the US House of Representatives when the new Democratic-led Congress starts in January -- but she faces a potential challenger in Rep.

She has represented Ohio's 11th Congressional District since 2008 and is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of progressive Democrats in the House, and a member and former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, an influential voting bloc in the lower chamber.\n\nThe House speaker will be the highest position of power for the Democratic Party in the next Congress after Democrats won back control of the lower chamber in the midterm elections last week.\n\nOn Thursday, Fudge told CNN she has been \"overwhelmed\" by the response she has received from colleagues.\n\n\"It has been heartwarming and humbling to know how many people think that I should do this,\" she said.\n\nWhoever wields the gavel will have a significant platform to challenge President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.

The California Democrat described the meeting via a spokesman as \"a candid and respectful conversation.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, Fudge told reporters that Pelosi did not specifically ask her not to run. Pelosi did ask what Fudge would need in order to support her bid, though. Fudge said she wanted to know about succession planning and being a more inclusive caucus.\n\n\"I think the biggest issue we discussed was the feeling within the caucus who are feeling left out and left behind,\" Fudge said.\n\nFudge was one of 17 Democrats who have signed a letter saying they will not vote for Pelosi to be speaker on the House floor.\n\nIf Fudge were to officially enter the race, her record in Congress will come under increased scrutiny.\n\nFudge's office is already defending the fact that she has not signed on as a cosponsor of the Equality Act, a bill that would amend the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act to add protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn a statement released by her office on Thursday, Fudge said, \"I fully support equal rights for the LGBTQ community. There is not one vote that I have ever taken that is anti-LGBTQ.\"\n\nShe elaborated, saying, \"What I opposed was including the Equality Act in the current Civil Rights Act. The Civil Rights Act is over 50 years old and isn't even adequate to protect the people currently in it. I want us to do a new and modern civil rights bill that protects the LGBTQ community and updates protections for this era. I do not believe it is appropriate to open and relitigate the current Civil Rights Act.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, she endorsed Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor her part, Pelosi doesn't sound afraid of a challenge.\n\n\"Come on in, the water's warm,\" she told reporters earlier in the week when asked about the possibility of an opponent.\n\nThe veteran Democratic leader, who made history as the first woman to serve as House speaker when she held the title from 2007 to 2011, has repeatedly said she believes she has the votes to win the gavel.\n\nDemocrats will select their nominee for speaker the week after Thanksgiving.

An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small, international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier.\n\n\"Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed,\" explained Alan Krause, co-director of the challenge, along with his wife, Alice.\n\nTherefore, for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world, most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability.\n\nCompeting against nature\n\nThe way the challenge works is that over seven days, the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories, which means they compete with one another, with their own personal records, the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. \"They are competing against the forces of nature, against air,\" Krause said.\n\nIn addition to men and women's standard \"open class\" speed categories, there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels, \"multitrack\"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females, and nearly every year, at least one world record is broken.\n\nPhotos: The 2018 World Human Powered Speed Challenge University teams and enterprising individuals bring their bike designs to the Nevada desert every year to attempt to be the fastest person on Earth without an engine.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nRace organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening, which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind, but it's also colder, which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.\n\nThe bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes, but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.\n\nThe bikes are a bit tipsy when they start, requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity, and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction, the whole run is disqualified.\n\n\"The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily, so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left, and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out,\" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis, Tennessee, and team Gee Bee.\n\nAccidents are common, mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course, each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them.\n\n\"It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course,\" said Karen Darke, a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.\n\nOptions are limited for spectators, even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley, and they held a couple of dozen fans this year, some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set.\n\nAt the starting line, there's no place to sit, but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then, when it's their turn, scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start.\n\nThe World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver, who drove around California and Nevada in 1994, recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest, straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt, the maximum grade allowed by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent, a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4,000 feet high, a good altitude for thinner air.\n\nA nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway, in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later, the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nIt was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today, the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching, on a 2\u00bd-mile short track, a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. \"A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest,\" Krause said.\n\nFifteen riders came from 11 teams this year, representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Italy, England, France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes, such as the Velox 7, Wahoo, Eta Prime, Dos to the Tres, Super Ketta 162, Taurus and Blue Nose.\n\nThe current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert, who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike, the Arion4, Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.\n\nAnnouncements, organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial, well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders, who are happy to answer.\n\nBlowin' through the wind\n\nThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels, even though they always have. \"If it had skis, it would be a land vehicle in the open class,\" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year, one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven.\n\nThat said, most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts, if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. \"While there have been experiments with linear drives, ones with a straight-line pedal path, no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks,\" Krause said.\n\nSpeed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance.\n\nThe holy grail, aerodynamically speaking, is \"laminar flow,\" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk, who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.\n\nBecause the bubble of a window adds drag, many of bikes are fully enclosed, the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.\n\nWeight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber and foam cores. \"You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it,\" Krause said.\n\nBut the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules, but of course, the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine, or \"stored energy,\" as one crew member called it.\n\nDo you have the need? The need for speed?\n\nTo make an attempt at a bike speed record, you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions, have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association, you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.\n\nCompetitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders, the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience, Bicycling Science and Human Power, available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.\n\nBeing in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. \"It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance,\" Krause said.\n\n\"There's a mental component, too,\" he added. The experience is scary for some, claustrophobic for others. \"These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air, and some wear oxygen masks.\"\n\nDarke noted, \"after I tried it for the first proper run, I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical.\"\n\nAlthough a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn, there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway, organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCrashes can, of course, occur at very high speeds, but injuries are typically not serious, usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line, when the bike \"exploded,\" Krause said, but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.\n\nAs Mario Andretti, one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions, put it: \"If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Due to wildfires, California now has the most polluted cities in the world", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/5usvmUpsfnQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Due to the wildfires raging in Northern California, San Francisco, Stockton and Sacramento were the world's three \"most polluted cities\" on Friday morning, according to Berkeley Earth , a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites.\n\nCNN meteorologist Brandon Miller confirmed that \"no region on Earth had as many air quality stations in the highest ranges\" of particulate matter, or PM, the toxic mixture of particles and droplets that worsens after wildfires.\n\nThose values, he said, \"stretched for hundreds of miles over Northern and Central California, from the mountains to the valleys and the coast.\"\n\nA ferry boat makes its way toward Alcatraz Island as the San Francisco skyline in is obscured by wildfire smoke and haze.\n\nSchools, colleges and public transit have closed as smoke from the Camp Fire descends on the region.\n\n\"It appears to be the worst air quality ever experienced in San Francisco,\" said Dan Jaffe, a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Washington.

UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes, but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.\n\nThe school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the \"administration's insufficient response to these public health risks\" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units.\n\n\"Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside,\" the group wrote.

My professor told me to go home.\"\n\nStudents struggle to find respirators\n\nThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask, but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma.\n\n\"There are over 40,000 students at the university,\" spokesman Dan Mogulof said, \"and we just don't have access to masks of that number.\"\n\nSome students, though, still think the school needs to be doing more.\n\nStudents at the University of California, Berkeley wait for respirators distributed by a student-led organization Thursday.\n\n\"I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act,\" Greene said.\n\nThe student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday, she said, leading to large crowds as people \"desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club, which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene.\"\n\nIn stores near Berkeley, masks also quickly sold out, Greene said, leading to \"an absurd sort of competition between students to get one.\" Students lucky enough to get the masks, she said, were trying to sell them at \"absurd prices.\"\n\nIn a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation, the school's chancellor, Carol Christ, said Thursday that Berkeley had \"a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality.\"\n\nGreene called that \"too little too late\" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that \"even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors.\"\n\nJaffe, however, said that \"the masks definitely help\" if worn properly and are \"better than nothing,\" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.\n\nThe university, for its part, says it's doing the best it can. \"Our students, like our staff, our faculty and our neighbors, are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history,\" Mogulof said. \"The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire.\"\n\nStaying safe in the smoke\n\nParticulate matter is the \"number one environmental killer in the world,\" Jacob said, and \"the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India.\"\n\nSmoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs, Jaffe added, and \"young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns.\"\n\nAnd because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience PM can aggravate asthma, decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, according to a study published last year in the Lancet And because childrenwith developing airways breathemore air per pound of body weight than adults, they can experience more severe symptoms\n\n\"We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that,\" Jaffe said, \"but those don't mitigate the problem too much.\" That's especially true in San Francisco, where many don't have air conditioning.\n\nWithout any sort of \"controlled system\" to filter air, Jaffe said, a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter.

These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN on Thursday.\n\nDespite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors, Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.\n\nHe also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or \"appealing to youth.\"\n\n\"This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters, or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda,\" the announcement said.\n\nConsumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\n\"We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" he said. \"This is one of our highest priorities.\"\n\n'Spike in use'\n\nOne in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month, according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I'm also a father of young kids, and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about,\" Gottlieb told CNN. \"Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools, in their middle schools.\"\n\nHealth experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\n\"The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"This is a large pool of future risk.\"\n\nThe new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year, and they are using flavored liquids more often, according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days, and over two-thirds had used flavored products.\n\n\"Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use, and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products, with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease.\"\n\nThe new numbers come from a school-based survey, conducted from March to May, which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year, now totaling 3.6 million kids, Gottlieb said.\n\nThe \"alarming\" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers \"earlier than usual\" in hopes of spurring immediate action, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes, we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily,\" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThe rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now, that number is 20.8%.\n\nGottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years.\n\n\"The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains,\" he told CNN. \"We simply cannot let that happen.\"\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nHealth and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals, but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner.\n\n\"Even with new sales restrictions, teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes,\" Kraft said.\n\nThe proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products \"sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance, a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop),\" the announcement said.\n\nCritics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence.\n\n\"The FDA needs to go further,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement Friday. \"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales.\"\n\nThe FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past, issuing warnings and fines to more than 1,300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids, after an undercover investigation this summer.\n\nMyers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA \"as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids, as in the case of Juul.\"\n\nInstead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.\n\nThis decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services, filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval.\n\nUnder Gottlieb's latest proposal, the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use.\n\n\"We hope that within the next 90 days, manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures,\" Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nHe told CNN, \"If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here, because there is more that we can do.\"\n\nMenthol\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes,\" Gottlieb said Thursday. \"I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"Moreover, I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes, saying that \"the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans.\"\n\nNearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010, representing more than 80% of black smokers, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, R.J. Reynolds, which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US, denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it \"will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans\" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would \"increase the illegal market, fueling more criminal activity.\"\n\nThe company has fought previous similar efforts, contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products, which voters approved in June.\n\nCiting the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth, National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA \"to move forward with urgency to implement this plan\" in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear,\" Morial said.\n\n'Not enough'\n\nVaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday.\n\n\"No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However, this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative,\" Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause,\" he said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids.\n\n\"We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product,\" said the association, which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.\n\nPharmacy chain CVS Health, which does not sell tobacco or vaping products, supported the move. Its chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan, said that the company applauds \"the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products, which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.\"\n\n\"The need for action is urgent,\" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement Thursday. \"But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough.\n\n\"The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market,\" she added, \"and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids.\"\n\nOther actions\n\nThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids, beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.\n\nIt recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nThat move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.\n\nThis month, Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will \"focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth.\"\n\nGottlieb has met with companies like Juul, asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands.

a dream dismissal for an off-spinner - angling the ball towards slip from around the wicket and finding sharp turn to bowl Lakmal through the gate.\n\nA magnificent Test ended in slightly anticlimactic fashion as England waited for the third umpire to confirm that Pushpakumara had not hit the ball into the ground in chipping it back to Leach, who finished with 5-83.\n\nBarren run ends as Root era begins\n\nEngland captain Joe Root (centre) made a superb 124 - his 15th Test century - in the second innings\n\nBetween the 2-1 victory in 2001 and this win, England have played three Test series in Sri Lanka, losing 1-0 in 2003-04 and 2007-08 and drawing 1-1 in 2011-12.\n\nThis Sri Lanka side may be shorn of former greats who played in those series, but they did beat South Africa 2-0 in July and this remains a tough place to play.\n\nThe result is also impressive given England's dire struggles over the past two winters - a 4-0 Ashes defeat followed by losing in New Zealand this year and a 4-0 thrashing by India after a draw with Bangladesh under Root's predecessor Alastair Cook the previous year.\n\nEngland's spinners lacked control at times but outperformed their Sri Lanka counterparts, with Leach, Moeen, Adil Rashid and Root taking 19 wickets in the Test, the other coming from a Stokes run-out.\n\nIt is only the third time in England's 363 Test victories they have won without a seamer taking a wicket, with Sam Curran and James Anderson hardly used on a turning pitch but both contributing vital lower-order runs in the first innings.\n\nThis Test could prove the moment England become Root's side outright. He talked before the series about wanting to be more \"courageous\" on subcontinental pitches and his team bought into it here.\n\nThey batted positively, mostly with calculated risk among some more rash shots, to put the pressure back on Sri Lanka's bowlers, while Root largely marshalled his spinners well and played the most decisive innings of the game with a sublime 124 on day three.\n\nThis is also the first time an England side have won all three series in all formats on tour, albeit they only played Sri Lanka in a one-off Twenty20.\n\n'A fantastic effort' - reaction & analysis\n\nEngland head coach Trevor Bayliss on Sky Sports: \"It is only England's second series win here. Coming here, playing a team in their home conditions - conditions that are foreign to us - it is a fantastic effort.\n\n\"The spinners were a bit below par in the first innings; we didn't get quite enough balls in the right areas. We spoke about that and, under pressure to perform in the second innings, they did a fantastic job.\n\n\"Both Rory Burns and Ben Foakes were playing in their second Tests but looked so calm. When they are batting it looks like they are playing in their 30th or 40th Test. That is a great sign going forward. That sends a message to the opposition. We knew Foakes was a very good keeper and he has proved it in this match.\"\n\nEx-England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social: \"They've won the key moments, the moments that matter, which is exactly what you need to do in Test match cricket.\n\n\"I don't remember seeing an England team with as much talent and that's why it's frustrating when we have performances like at Trent Bridge and at Lord's against Pakistan.\"\n\nBen Foakes (left) averages 76 with the bat in his first two Tests\n\nEngland slow left-armer Jack Leach: \"Unbelievable! It's a great feeling. These boys (Moeen and Adil Rashid) have helped me out so much. It was good to play on this wicket but, at other times, I felt it was tough.\"\n\nEngland leg-spinner Adil Rashid: \"It feels good to have three spinners in the team. We all know our roles and help each other out. It's nice to make history and hopefully we can carry that on now.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Suranga Lakmal: \"Both sides played very good cricket.

Again, it is hard to believe this would have been without the crown prince's knowledge.\n\nTaken together with the Sigint (signals intelligence), the case against MBS is damning but still circumstantial.\n\nGovernment officials do not believe there is a metaphorical \"smoking gun\" that explicitly ties MBS to the murder. But drawing on well-established diplomatic and intelligence contacts, they know that in that part of the world nothing gets done without sign-off from the top.\n\nIn the tightly controlled Arab Gulf states, there is simply no such thing as \"a rogue operation\", as Saudi statements have described it. Meanwhile the glaring inconsistencies in the official Saudi explanations have only deepened suspicions of a state-sponsored cover-up."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Golden Horse: Zhang Yimou's Shadow wins most awards", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46250674", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:26", "body_paragraphs": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Taiwanese director Yue Fu (R) won the best documentary award\n\nOne of China's most acclaimed directors, a rising star with a tragic story and a documentary charting mass protests have all won top prizes at this year's Golden Horse awards.\n\nThe 55th annual awards - dubbed the \"Chinese Oscars\" - were held in the Taiwanese capital Taipei on Saturday.\n\nZhang Yimou's Shadow took home the most awards, including Best Director for the 68-year-old screen veteran.\n\nBest Film went to novelist-turned-director Hu Bo for his first feature.\n\nAn Elephant Sitting Still was an adaptation of his own novel, which told the story of four people who run away from their troubles to search for a mythical elephant.\n\nHu took his own life in the Chinese capital Beijing last year, aged 29.

I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.\"\n\nThe cabinet \"gang of five\" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThe backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nThe UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier\n\nAccording to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue.\n\nThe group's plans were described as a \"work in progress\", and a \"last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons\".\n\nThe deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to \"tweaks\" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said \"nothing fundamental\" could change.\n\nOur correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter \"some kind of bargaining process\" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year.\n\n\"I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,\" he told Sky News.\n\nWhisky for May\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was \"not everybody's ideal deal\" but said her job was to make \"tough decisions\" and \"find a way through\".\n\nShe also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.\n\nCommenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been \"a pretty heavy couple of days\".\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The PM says her husband is protective over her\n\nShe revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her \"rock\", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast.\n\nOn Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a \"social media blitz\" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics.\n\nMrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday.\n\nA No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy\n\nIn other developments:\n\nAmber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal\n\nStephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle\n\nAnd John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman\n\nDavid Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan\n\nOn Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement\n\nThe Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that \"anything that re-emphasises\" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and the threat of violence was not being exaggerated\n\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told his party that his government wants to build bridges rather than new borders.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Reality Check: Brexit withdrawal agreement - what it all means", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46237012", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:44", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.\n\nChris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.\n\nTransition\n\nThe transition period (which the UK government calls \"implementation period\") begins on 29 March 2019 and lasts until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but this can only happen once and for a limited period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU must agree to any extension and the decision must be taken before 1 July 2020.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nMoney\n\nThe draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or \"divorce bill\") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.\n\nWhile no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least \u00a339bn and it will be paid over a number of years.\n\nPart of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net \u00a310.8bn.\n\nIf the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the \"divorce bill\" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.\n\nMoney remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.\n\nCitizens' rights\n\nThis is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.\n\nUK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.\n\nCitizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.\n\nAnyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nBritish citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues.\n\nNorthern Ireland/the backstop\n\nIf no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of \"a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom\" will be triggered.\n\nNorthern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.\n\nAs long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to \"level playing field conditions\", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.\n\nThe UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.\n\nThat upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nFishing\n\nThe agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.\n\nThe document says: \"The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.\n\nIt's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.\n\nLaws and disputes\n\nThe UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.\n\nA joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nIf the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.\n\nInstead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.\n\nChris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.\n\nThat is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.\n\nWhat else is in it?\n\nElsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.\n\nThere's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.\n\nEU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like \"Welsh Lamb\" or \"Parma Ham\" remain.\n\nAlongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml", "title": "Stephen Barclay named new Brexit Secretary", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46241693", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:00:46", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nStephen Barclay has been picked as the new Brexit secretary, as Theresa May seeks to fill her cabinet after several of her top team quit.\n\nThe MP for North East Cambridgeshire - who is a Leave supporter - had been a health minister since January.\n\nHe replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned on Thursday over Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for Brexit.\n\nA No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay would focus on the domestic preparations rather than negotiations.\n\nMr Barclay's promotion comes after a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, after two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides quit following the publication of the proposed Brexit agreement.\n\nAnd some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the deal have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May.

in what appears to be the demise of one of the UK's largest providers of homecare - is reassurance.\n\nAllied Healthcare, councils, the regulator and the government are focused on making sure vital care will continue as normal for the more than 13,000 people, who get visits from the company's staff.\n\nNo one can afford to get that wrong. But once handovers have happened, serious questions will remain about the pressure on the care market. Earlier this year, Allied blamed low fees from local authorities for some of their financial woes.\n\nCouncils themselves warn of a \u00a33.5 billion shortfall in funding for adult social care by 2025.

So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"\n\nWhy kill off the kilogram?\n\nLe Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe.\n\nBut the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated.\n\nIn a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition.\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n\nHow wrong is Le Grand K?\n\nThe fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian.\n\n\"We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time.\"\n\nHow does the new system work?\n\nElectromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight.\n\nSo, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass).\n\nHere's the tricky part\n\nThere is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbol h.\n\nBut h is an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other.\n\nThe electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced.\n\nBy measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculate h to an accuracy of 0.000001%.\n\nThis breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by \"die kleine h\".\n\nImage copyright BIPM Image caption Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote\n\nWhat are the advantages of the new system?\n\nEvery few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson.\n\n\"It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Greenland ice sheet hides huge 'impact crater'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46181450", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:01", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OF DENMARK Image caption Space view: The semi-circular margin of the ice sheet traces the outline of the crater\n\nWhat looks to be a large impact crater has been identified beneath the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nThe 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.\n\nInvestigations suggest the feature was probably dug out by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago.\n\nBut without drilling through nearly 1km of ice to sample the bed directly, scientists can't be more specific.\n\n\"We will endeavour to do this; it would certainly be the best way to get the 'dead fish on the table' (acknowledge the issue, rather than leaving it), so to speak,\" Prof Kurt Kj\u00e6r, from the Danish Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\nIf confirmed, the crater would be the first of any size that has been observed under one of Earth's continental ice sheets.\n\nThe discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.\n\nImage copyright Svend Funder Image caption Kurt Kj\u00e6r collects sand transported from under the glacier\n\nWhat does the crater look like?\n\nThe putative impact crater is located right on the northwest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, underneath what is known as Hiawatha Glacier.\n\nAdditional high-resolution radar imagery gathered by Prof Kj\u00e6r's team clearly shows a circular structure that is elevated at its rim and at its centre - both classic traits. But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait. If you wanted to find this material today, you'd have to do deep drilling in the ocean,\" Prof Kj\u00e6r explained.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Iain McDonald: \"The Cape York meteorite could be linked to this impact\"\n\nWhat are the age constraints?\n\nThe team knows the crater must be older than roughly 12,000 years because the undisturbed ice layers above the depression can be lined up with the layers in drill cores that have been directly dated.\n\nAnd they estimate an age younger than three million years based on an assessment of likely rock erosion rates, both within the crater and on nearby terrains. But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

in a significant increase in CO\u2082 emissions, scientists warn.\n\nThat could mean attaining the Paris climate agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rise well below 2C could become harder, they say.\n\nPresent emission-cut pledges by countries are projected to increase the average global temperature rise by more than 3C by the end of the century.\n\nThat would lead to dangerous climate change impacts, experts say.\n\nThese include sea level rise, drought, wildfires, among other extreme events.\n\n\"We can't neglect the emissions from wildfires,\" says Ramon Vallejo, a scientist specialising on fire ecology with the University of Barcelona.\n\n\"Particularly now that we are seeing intense wildfires all around the world.\"\n\nEstimates and uncertainties\n\nAlthough estimates vary and still carry uncertainties, some experts say wildfires account for up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey are estimated to increase by a few percent to roughly 30% by the end of this century depending on how the climate changes.\n\n\"It is a double whammy,\" said William Lau, atmospheric scientist with Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.\n\n\"Big forest fires first lead to significant reduction of forests that suck in CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and the second loss is they cause significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nA study earlier this year, however, had found that the annual amount of CO\u2082 emitted as a result of wildfires having fallen over the past 80 years.\n\nIt said the main reason was that large areas of forest and savannah had been converted to land for crops over the past few decades and therefore wildfires had decreased.\n\nThe research, however, found that the drop was not huge though.\n\nIntense wildfires\n\nThe reason behind that, experts say, is the significantly increased intensity and size of wildfires.\n\nThat is why, they add, there are now concerns over possible notable rise of CO\u2082 emissions.\n\nThe total global CO\u2082 emissions reached 32.5 billion tons last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Embers blow in the wind during this year's wildfires in California\n\nThere has, however, not been an exact quantification of emissions from recent wildfires and the one in California now.\n\nSome estimates suggest that the wildfire in northern California last year emitted as much CO\u2082 in a week as what all of the cars and trucks in the state do in a year.\n\nThat is why some fire experts in that US state fear that its level of CO\u2082 emissions could endanger its progress toward meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.\n\nOther hotspots\n\nWhile California and Australia are most of the time in news for their wildfires these days, other regions have also seen intensified wildfires recently.\n\nEarlier this year, Greece saw its most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900 as it claimed 91 lives.\n\nLast year, in Portugal and Spain nearly 70 people were killed by the extreme event.\n\nWildfires in Sweden this year were another extreme case.\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the fires burned 30,000 hectares of Swedish forest and triggered EU emergency response mechanisms.\n\nIn Indonesia, wildfires in September and October of 2015 released about 11.3 teragrams of CO\u2082 per day, the UN's weather agency said.\n\n\"For comparison, the daily release of CO\u2082 from fossil fuel burning in the European Union is 8.9 teragrams.\"\n\nA recent study found that the Earth's boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years.\n\n'100% rise in wildfires'\n\nAnother study published in Nature Communications has concluded that if global temperatures rose by three degrees, Mediterranean Europe could see a 100% rise in wildfires.\n\nIt added that a 1.5C rise could lead to a 40% increase in wildfires.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Climate models project a sharp increase in wildfires across the Mediterranean\n\n\"We cannot extrapolate our findings to other forested regions of the world,\" said Dr Marco Turco, lead author of the report.\n\n\"But the projection is that most places across the globe will see similar intensified wildfires in a warming climate.\"\n\nScientists say warming causes more fires which, in turn, cause more warming.\n\nFossil fuel emissions\n\nSome experts, however, say greenhouse emissions from wildfires are still tiny compared to emissions from other human activities.\n\n\"The California wildfires are enormous,\" said Pieter Tans, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).\n\n\"But I expect that the amount of CO\u2082 emitted is at most a few percent of what the US burns annually in making electricity, heating and cooling of buildings, traffic, etc.\"\n\nThomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics (LSE) has a similar view.\n\n\"These (California) fires are likely fairly insignificant in terms of their global contribution to greenhouse gases,\" he said.\n\n\"At any one time, there are many fires of a similar size burning across the planet; it's just that this one has been close to populated places.\"\n\nPeatland perils\n\nSome scientists say the really worry is burning of peatlands.\n\nMany of them believe the largest ever wildfire emissions in modern times was the Indonesian peat fire in 1997-98.\n\nEstimates vary, but the largest emission figure for it is 3.7 billion metric ton CO\u2082.\n\n\"The real wildcard is permafrost thaw due to climate change that can make a large amount of northern peat susceptible to fire, which was previously unavailable for burning,\" says Bill Degroot, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service.\n\n\"Peatlands are a very large terrestrial [carbon] pool.\"\n\nScientists also say the issue of wildfires is even more challenging compared to cutting down carbon emissions from burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\"If you want to, you can indeed cut down carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning activities - that is something under your control,\" says Professor Vallejo.\n\n\"But wildfires are not something controllable like that. They will happen and will intensify in a warming world.\""}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Exoplanet discovered around neighbouring star", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46196279", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:05", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright ESO/M.

It's probably very rich in volatiles like water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide - things like this. Many of them are frozen on the surface\".\n\nThe Sun's closest neighbours\n\nImage copyright IEEC/Science-Wave - Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe astronomer, from Queen Mary University of London, added: \"The closest analogue we may have in the Solar System might be the moon of Saturn called Titan, which also has a very thick atmosphere and is made of hydrocarbons. It has rain and lakes made of methane.\"\n\nThe planet, Barnard's Star b, is about as far away from its star as Mercury is from the Sun. It's the second closest exoplanet to Earth after Proxima Centauri b, whose discovery was announced in 2016.\n\nThe planet orbits past a boundary called the \"snow line\", beyond the traditional habitable zone where water can remain liquid on the surface.\n\nOn distance alone, it's estimated that temperatures would be about -150C on the planet's surface. However, a massive atmosphere could potentially warm the planet, making conditions more hospitable to life.\n\nImage copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: It's thought the planet is rocky, with a massive atmosphere\n\nThe researchers used the radial velocity method for their detection. The technique can detect \"wobbles\" in a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.\n\nThese wobbles also affect the light coming from the star. As it moves towards Earth its light appears shifted towards the blue part of the spectrum and, as it moves away, it appears shifted towards the red.\n\nEarth-sized planet orbits neighbouring star\n\nWhere should we look for aliens?\n\nCould Nasa's next big thing detect alien life?\n\n\"This planet is particularly complicated because the orbital period (the time to complete one full orbit of the host star) is 233 days. In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected.

The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK.\n\n\"It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy.\"\n\nEarlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use.\n\nWhat do environmentalists say?\n\nThe environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: \u201cThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet.\n\n\u201cAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: \"We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods.\"\n\nThere may be controversy, too, over the committee\u2019s recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy \u2013 known as biomass.\n\nA separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK \u2013 but only if it\u2019s produced in a way that doesn\u2019t harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted.\n\nHow climate change is already changing the landscape\n\nThe CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8\u00b0C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse.\n\nLoss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production.\n\nProjections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought.\n\n\"Despite some opportunities,\u201d the report says,\"The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"site": "onion", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "https://www.theonion.com/rss", "title": "\u2018The Powerpuff Girls\u2019 Turns 20", "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/the-powerpuff-girls-turns-20-1830501521", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:10", "body_paragraphs": "Nov. 18 marks 20 years since the debut of The Powerpuff Girls, the Craig McCracken\u2013created cartoon that follows three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year. We're gaining green jobs much faster than we' re losing jobs in the coal sector.\""}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/scirss.xml", "title": "New phone app to assist in recovery of knee replacement surgery: Aust'n scientists", "article_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/30/c_136170125.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:27", "body_paragraphs": "CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A new app designed for patients requiring knee replacement surgery has been developed by Australia's leading scientific agency, in a greater push to assist people prepare for, and recover from, the important surgery.\n\nThe app, designed in collaboration between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, will aim to reduce the recovery time and offer better rehabilitation techniques.\n\nDr Rob Grenfell from the CSIRO said the technology had the potential to make a huge difference to patient recovery by providing patients with practical information -

This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide,\" said U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and coauthor, Patrick Barnard.\n\nAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing.

The other would require that employees qualify for between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave, depending on the size of their employer.\n\nIt is unclear how the laws may be changed to appease an anxious business lobby. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce says mandatory sick time, 10 other states also require it, will place \u201csevere compliance burdens\u201d on employers, including those with paid leave policies currently in place. The group also is urging lawmakers to \u201cbe pragmatic, not extreme\u201d and revisit the wage hikes that would make Michigan\u2019s minimum the highest in the Midwest.\n\nRepublicans seem unfazed by criticism that scaling back the measures would thwart the will of voters who resoundingly elected Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to replace GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, who reached his term limit. The Michigan Senate\u2019s majority leader, Arlan Meekhof, said changes to the laws are needed to \u201ccontinue to keep our economy on track and not put a roadblock or hindrance\u201d in the way of businesses.\n\nLame-duck sessions\n\nLame-duck sessions, which are commonplace in Congress but rare among many state legislatures, are frenetic, as legislators rush to consider bills that are controversial or were put on the back burner during election season. Michigan\u2019s 2012 session, for example, produced right-to-work laws and a contentious revised emergency manager statute for cities in financial peril, despite voters having just repealed the previous law.\n\nThe lame-duck period may be especially intense this year in Michigan and Wisconsin because they are among just four states in which Republicans are losing full control the governorship and both legislative chambers. Lawmakers in the other two states, Kansas and New Hampshire, will not convene until next year.\n\nSix states with a split government now will be fully controlled by Democrats in 2019, and Alaska will be fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nOn GOP agendas\n\nWisconsin Republicans plan to consider a variety of ways to protect laws enacted by Walker. Those include limiting Evers\u2019 ability to make appointments, restricting his authority over the rule-making process and making it more difficult for him to block a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. They might also change the date of the 2020 presidential primary so that a Walker-appointed state Supreme Court justice has better odds to win election.\n\nIn North Carolina, GOP legislators may use the session for more than approving additional bipartisan Hurricane Florence relief. They are expected to implement a voter photo ID requirement passed this month by the electorate and to consider other legislation that the Democratic governor would be powerless to stop until Republicans can no longer easily override his vetoes come 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, they reduced Cooper\u2019s powers before he took office. He successfully sued over a law that diminished his role in managing elections. Other suits remain pending.\n\nMichigan\u2019s outgoing governor, Snyder, hasn\u2019t weighed in on the plan to amend the minimum wage and sick leave laws, which would require his signature, unlike when they were passed. He is trying to persuade his fellow Republicans to boost and add new fees for environmental cleanup and water infrastructure upgrades, and he wants the Legislature to help facilitate a deal to drill an oil pipeline tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac. The agreement is opposed by Whitmer and the state\u2019s Democratic Attorney General-elect, Dana Nessel.\n\nSupporters of the existing wage and sick time laws have been mobilizing to keep them intact. MI Time to Care, the campaign backing guaranteed paid time off for workers who are sick or need to stay home with an ill family member, launched ads, mailed postcards and went door to door before the election reminding people of their rights under the law that is scheduled to take effect in March.\n\nChairwoman Danielle Atkinson said the sick leave proposal would have been approved in a \u201clandslide\u201d if it had been on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly why the Legislature moved to pass it, and now they should uphold it as the promise that they made to the voters,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Democrats Take Southern California GOP Stronghold", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-take-southern-california-gop-stronghold/4663422.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "Democrat Gil Cisneros captured a Republican-held U.S. House seat in Southern California on Saturday, capping a Democratic rout in which the party picked up six congressional seats in the state.\n\nIn what had been the last undecided House contest in California, Cisneros beat Republican Young Kim for the state\u2019s 39th District seat. The Cisneros victory cements a stunning political realignment that will leave a vast stretch of the Los Angeles metropolitan area under Democratic control in the House.\n\nWith Kim\u2019s defeat, four Republican-held House districts all or partly in Orange County, California, a one-time nationally known GOP stronghold southeast of Los Angeles, will have shifted in one election to the Democratic column. The change means that the county \u2014 Richard Nixon\u2019s birthplace and site of his presidential library \u2014 will only have Democrats representing its residents in Washington next year.\n\nDemocrats also recently picked up the last Republican-held House seat anchored in Los Angeles County, when Democrat Katie Hill ousted Republican Rep. Steve Knight.\n\nWith other gains, Republicans also lost a seat in the agricultural Central Valley, Democrats will hold a 45-8 edge in California U.S. House seats next year.\n\nThe district was one of seven targeted by Democrats across California after Hillary Clinton carried them in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u200bKim couldn\u2019t shake Trump\n\nCisneros, 47, a $266 million lottery jackpot winner, had been locked in a close race with Kim in a district that has grown increasingly diverse.

Ed Royce, who is vacating the seat and had endorsed her.\n\nIn a state where President Donald Trump is unpopular, Kim sought to create distance with the White House on trade and health care.

Florida law requires a hand recount if a machine count finds the margin of victory is less than 0.25 percent.\n\nGillum conceded the race Saturday afternoon, posting a video on Facebook in which he congratulated DeSantis on the win.

Now they just need a speaker of the House.\n\nThe standoff over Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to regain the gavel intensified as Democrats left Washington for the Thanksgiving break in what has turned out to be an unsettling finish to an otherwise triumphant week that saw them welcome a historic class of newcomers to Capitol Hill and prepare to take control from Republicans.\n\nPelosi, speaker from 2007 to 2011 and the first woman to hold that job, was certain she will hold it again. Her foes were equally confident they have the votes to stop her ascension. And now President Donald Trump is getting into the fray, offering Saturday to provide Republican votes for Pelosi\u2019s candidacy even though the GOP has long used the California Democrat as an election target.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a band of disgruntled Democrats, led mostly by men, in the forefront of the opposition. With a test vote looming in late November, and at least one potential Pelosi challenger stepping forward, Democrats are facing the uncomfortable prospect of the internal squabble that the speaker\u2019s vote Jan. 3 could drag on for weeks.\n\n\u201cI think chaos is good if it\u2019s productive. I think chaos is bad if it is too disruptive and it divides us too much,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leaders were upbeat after meeting with Pelosi this past week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWe need to put forward the vision of who we are as a party and what we\u2019re fighting for and so that needs to happen very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nPelosi was expected to work the phones from California after meeting privately Friday with newly elected Democrats who could be crucial to her bid.\n\nThose incoming lawmakers indicated they were having good meetings with the leader, though few said the talks had changed their minds.\n\nRep.-elect Abigail Spanberger of Virginia said she had a \u201cwonderful conversation\u201d about her district\u2019s priorities, but \u201cwill not be voting\u201d for Pelosi.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about wanting new leadership,\u201d said Spanberger, a former CIA operative who defeated tea party Republican Rep. Dave Brat in suburban Richmond. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything she could say, because the decision isn\u2019t about her.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he had a \u201cpleasant\u201d meeting, but remains a \u201cno\u201d on Pelosi. He is among 17 Democrats who have signed on to a letter opposing her. Van Drew said they discussed his districts and which committees he\u2019d like to serve on. \u201cI don\u2019t feel under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi also met for 45 minutes with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, a potential rival for the speakership who said the two had \u201ca very open and frank discussion,\u201d including about \u201cthe feeling in the caucus of people who are feeling left out and left behind.\u201d\n\nFudge said she would probably decide after Thanksgiving break whether she will run.\n\n\u201cTo her credit, she wanted to know what my concerns were,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cWhat she asked me was, basically, how we could get to a point where I\u2019m supportive.\u201d\n\nOne question for some Democrats is what, exactly, Pelosi means when she says she intends to be a transitional leader, a bridge to a new generation. She has led the party for 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe talked about some succession planning,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cI think it is something our caucus is interested in knowing.\u201d\n\nIf it were up to most of the Democratic Party, Pelosi easily would win. They see her as a skilled and tested leader prepared to confront Trump and deliver on priorities.\n\nPelosi, 78, first became speaker after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. With President Barack Obama, she was pivotal in passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nShe appears to be winning the outside game in her bid, amassing endorsements from a who\u2019s who of the nation\u2019s Democrats. Inside the Capitol she has support from influential lawmakers such as Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, and backing from some of the incoming House members.\n\nThe internal debate is spilling out nationally, especially on social media, where Democratic activists are publicly criticizing Democratic Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio and others leading the campaign to oust Pelosi.\n\nIt\u2019s not lost on supporters that a group made up of mostly men is leading the effort. On the list of 17 names who\u2019ve signed onto a letter against her, just three are women.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 231 seats in the 435-member House, Pelosi does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed, assuming all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi\u2019s favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \u201cpresent,\u201d meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority.\n\nTrump, trying to insert himself into the race, tweeted on Saturday that he could get Pelosi \u201cas many votes as she wants\u201d to become speaker. \u201cShe deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win!\u201d\n\nTrump included the twitter link for Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican who has said he could be open to backing Pelosi if she committed to changes that would shift some power from the House leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest postelection praise of Pelosi raises questions about his sincerity, given the Republicans\u2019 election playbook of trying to tie Democrats in competitive congressional districts to Pelosi every chance they can. GOP lawmakers considering endorsing Pelosi would open themselves up to a potential primary challenges in 2020 for daring to support someone their base has reviled."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Trump Says Written Responses Go to Mueller Team Next Week", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-written-responses-go-to-mueller-team-next-week/4662833.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:30", "body_paragraphs": "President Donald Trump says he \u201cvery easily\u201d answered written questions from special counsel Robert Mueller, though he speculated that the questions had been \u201ctricked up\u201d to try to catch him in a lie.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all done,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House early Saturday before leaving for California, adding that his responses will soon be submitted to Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cWe do that next week,\u201d he said, in what signals a new phase of the inquiry.\n\nIn a swipe the day before at the investigation into 2016 election interference and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign, the president said that \u201cyou have to always be careful when you answer questions with people that probably have bad intentions.\u201d\n\nMueller has signaled a willingness to accept written answers on matters related to collusion with Russia. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said repeatedly the president would not answer Mueller\u2019s questions on possible obstruction of justice.\n\nDuring months of back-and-forth negotiations with the special counsel office, Trump\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly counseled the president against sitting down for an in-person interview.\n\nMueller\u2019s year-and-a-half-long investigation has produced guilty pleas and convictions from several top Trump aides even as the special counsel and the White House have engaged in lengthy negotiations about how \u2014 or if \u2014 the president would testify.\n\nThough he spent hours with his attorneys, Trump on Friday insisted: \u201cMy lawyers don\u2019t write answers, I write answers.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks were fresh evidence of his return to the ominous rhythms of the Russia probe after spending heady weeks enjoying adulation-soaked campaign rallies before the midterm elections.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s \u201cvery happy\u201d with how things are going, his frustrations with the probe have been evident everywhere from his Twitter feed this past week to his private grousing that the special counsel may target his family.

There has been widespread media coverage of two Trump allies \u2014 Roger Stone and Jerome Corsi \u2014 who say they expect to be charged.\n\nThe president has expressed concerns behind closed doors that Mueller is closing in on his inner circle, including potentially his eldest son.\n\nFor months, Trump has told confidants he fears that Donald Trump Jr., perhaps inadvertently, broke the law by being untruthful with investigators in the aftermath of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, according to one Republican close to the White House.\n\nTrump has also complained about efforts in the Senate by his longtime foe, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, to introduce legislation to protect the special counsel, according to the officials and Republicans.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has told confidants in recent days that he is deeply frustrated by widespread criticism of his choice of Matthew Whitaker for acting attorney general, according to four officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Whitaker has been a vocal opponent of the special counsel probe.\n\nOne argument against Whitaker was that he has not been confirmed by Senate. Trump contends that the criticism is unfair because Mueller also was not confirmed for his post. The special counsel position does not require confirmation, and the former FBI director was confirmed for that previous job.\n\nThe president also took note of news coverage of his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, arriving in Washington this past week, potentially to meet with Mueller\u2019s investigators. Cohen has pleaded guilty to a series of crimes and has said under oath that Trump ordered him to make hush-money payments to cover up an affair. He has undertaken an unlikely public relations tour as he looks to make a deal to reduce his prison sentence.\n\nThe renewed focus on the looming threat from Mueller comes as Trump settles back into the day-to-day routines of governing after the whirlwind campaign in which he spent weeks in front of adoring rally crowds while whipping up his base with harsh rhetoric about migrants moving through Mexico.\n\nHe faced criticism from both sides of the aisle for his weekend trip to Paris, during which he scuttled a visit to a World War I ceremony due to bad weather and further strained ties with traditional Western allies.\n\nOn other topics:\n\n\u2014 Despite his insistence that Americans no longer have to fear North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, news of Pyongyang\u2019s persistent weapons program made headlines this week.\n\n\u2014 And the White House is hurriedly stepping up efforts to prepare for a series of investigations certain to be launched by Democrats once they take control of the House in January.\n\nEven as Trump mused in the West Wing about making staffing changes, he pushed back against media coverage of his recent setbacks.\n\n\u201cThe White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe are the envy of the world.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889.\n\nBut now, with the vote, the kilogram and all of the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: Some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nNobel prize winner William Phillips called the update \"the greatest revolution in measurement since the French revolution,\" which ushered in the metric system of meters and kilograms.\n\nJon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said the vote left him \"a basket case\" and \"extremely emotional.\"\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" he said. \"That was just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\"\n\nThe Grand K and its six official copies, kept together in the same safe on the edge of Paris and collectively known as the \"heir and the spares,\" will be retired but not forgotten. Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses decay over time.\n\nBenefits of the change\n\nThe change will have no discernable impact for most people.

Like so many residents of Paradise, California, who have been displaced by the ongoing Camp fire, he hoped that perhaps his family\u2019s home could be saved. But as the hours passed, and refugees poured out of Paradise in cars and buses and on foot, it became clear that the wind-driven fire was moving faster and faster.\n\nThat night, Gonzales gathered his family. \u201cWe should start to be OK with the fact that maybe our stuff is gone,\u201d he told them.\n\nNow, just over a week later, the blaze that drove Gonzales out of Paradise has killed at least 71 people and become the most destructive fire in California history.

She shares a mattress with her elderly mother, and told HuffPost that they\u2019d been moved through the shelter twice to avoid getting the virus. By Thursday, a week after Andresen lost her Paradise home in the fire, she was bedridden and sick.\n\nBefore the medical team was able to provide assistance and a barrier, and before the National Guard sent in medical and quarantine tents on Friday morning, there was \u201cno dignity for anyone,\u201d Andresen said, as more and more people began throwing up and getting diarrhea, two of the norovirus symptoms.

That number is likely much higher now.\n\n\u201cThe number of sick people is increasing every day,\u201d a release from the health department stated. \u201cTwenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support. Staff serving the shelters have also been sick.\u201d\n\nA visit to the East Avenue Church shelter in Chico shows just how quickly norovirus, the leading cause of foodborne illness, is spreading in a community that has already suffered through so much unforeseen devastation.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty people were camped at the church on Friday when illness erupted in one corner of the shelter\u2019s multipurpose room. Evacuees overcome with sudden vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration were eventually protected by a barrier as volunteers rushed to treat them. They were feet away from their fellow evacuees, wearing air filtration masks and precautionary adult diapers, hoping not to add illness to the others\u2019 long lists of misfortunes. While volunteers bleached floors covered in feces and vomit, some evacuees took to the bushes outside the shelter to relieve themselves. These are the indignities of a catastrophe that no one plans for.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Avenue Church Shelter in Chico, California, where norovirus has spread and makeshift quarantine barriers have been erected.\n\nIt\u2019s not 100 percent certain that all patients are suffering from norovirus specifically, but the threat the infection poses justifies a prompt response. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are about 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and 570 to 800 deaths, mostly young children and the elderly, each year among those infected by it in the U.S.\n\nLater on Friday, the National Guard began setting up medical tents for Camp fire evacuees affected by norovirus in an attempt to better control its spread from shelter to shelter, all overcrowded with people made homeless by the fire and people who were already homeless but needed relief from the smoke. Some brought dogs and other pets.\n\nMeanwhile, counties more than a hundred miles from the fire are grappling with the health consequences of smoke that\u2019s settled around their homes.\n\nSince the Camp fire erupted on Nov. 8, the skies throughout the affected areas and spilling down into the San Francisco Bay Area have been brown and hazy. Visibility is poor. In San Francisco, the tops of buildings seem to disappear into the haze. Everywhere the air smells like fire.\n\nThat smoky, polluted air is full of microscopic pieces of particulate matter measuring roughly 2.5 micrometers or smaller, or PM 2.5. These particulates are too small to be caught by our lungs\u2019 filtration system and instead enter our bloodstreams, posing potential health risks to anyone breathing it but particularly to those with respiratory issues, as well as to older adults and children. Coughing, wheezing and other side effects have already affected many of those exposed to the abysmal air.\n\nThe Butte County Air Quality Management District reported \u201chazardous\u201d air quality in Paradise, where the fire started, and in nearby Chico, Oroville and Gridley. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AirNow site reported an Air Quality Index of 350 in Chico. For context, Delhi, India \u2015 one of the most notoriously polluted cities in the world \u2015 on Friday measured an AQI of about 240.\n\nEven the Bay Area, more than 165 miles from the epicenter of the Camp fire, is experiencing air quality conditions considered unsafe for anyone to go outside. The EPA measured an AQI of 238 in San Francisco on Friday.\n\nNorthern Californians take their good air for granted. Last year, San Francisco had 276 days with an AQI rating of \u201cgood.\u201d The average AQI in Delhi is \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Golden Gate Bridge is obscured by smoke and haze from wildfires Friday.\n\nMany schools and universities throughout the Bay Area have closed in recent days due to the poor air quality. Public schools in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano and Marin counties canceled classes on Friday due to the poor air quality. The University of California, Berkeley, San Francisco State University, California State University East Bay and other colleges closed their campuses, as well. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a \u201cSpare the Air\u201d alert effective from Thursday through Tuesday that includes a ban on \u201cburning wood, including manufactured fire logs or any other solid fuel, indoors or outdoors.\u201d\n\nEven San Francisco\u2019s famous cable cars were shut down on Friday.\n\nAuthorities also urged residents to stay indoors and to wear a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, marked N95 or higher, if and when they need to go outdoors.\n\nOne ACE hardware store in San Francisco\u2019s Inner Richmond district was out of masks Tuesday night but told customers a shipment of 1,000 more would be in the next morning. By Wednesday night, they were out again.\n\nThe shortage is standard across the city. Many vendors have limited customers to four masks per person. That limit has gone down to two in some places as supplies have dwindled.\n\nSmoke entering through the state\u2019s Central Valley is hovering in Bay Area counties, unable to escape through the Golden Gate, the National Weather Service explained. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of high daytime temperatures and low evening ones has triggered a phenomenon that traps the smoke close to the ground.\n\nEric Risberg/ASSOCIATED PRESS Pedestrians in San Francisco's Financial District wear protective masks against the hazardous air.\n\nThe particulates in wildfire smoke also have a somewhat different chemical makeup than the particles produced by cars and other daily sources of pollution. And it comes in short, intense episodes during and after a fire, which may present a different set of risks.\n\nNext to the immediate loss of life from the Camp fire, the air quality may seem a distant secondary concern. But how the poor air may affect survivors and other surrounding residents in the long term poses a frightening prospect.\n\nInhalation of PM 2.5 particles has been linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, heart attacks, asthma and other respiratory issues. PM exposure has also been linked to increased kidney disease risk and shortened life spans of those exposed to it in the womb.\n\nHazy conditions in the Bay Area are projected to persist over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. As for now, people\u2019s hope for relief from the smoke hinges on a chance of rain that may help clean the air late next week."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Half Of Reproductive-Age Women Want Easier Access To Abortion Pills, Study Finds", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-pill-access-women_us_5bec9ea8e4b09f4670066059", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Zhang Rong via Getty Images In a new survey, nearly half of 7,000 women said they were interested in new ways to get the abortion pill.\n\nA new national survey released Thursday shows substantial support for greater access to medication abortion among women in America.\n\nCurrently, a woman who wants to take the abortion pill \u2014 actually a combination of two drugs \u2014 must go to a medical facility where she takes the first medicine, mifepristone, in front of a clinician, and the second, misoprostol, at home some hours or days later.\n\nBut in the new survey of more than 7,000 reproductive-age women, 49 percent said they supported at least one of three models for obtaining the abortion pill. Forty-five percent said they supported getting the drugs in advance from a doctor for potential use down the road, 37 percent said they believed the drugs should be available over the counter and 30 percent said they supported making the pills available to women online.\n\nAnd when asked whether they\u2019d consider using any of those methods personally, nearly a quarter of the women said they\u2019d consider getting the pills in advance from a doctor or obtaining them over the counter, while 16 percent said they\u2019d be interested in buying the pills online.\n\n\u201cIf we consider that this is a representative sample of adult, reproductive-age women across the US \u2014 many of whom may not support abortion at all, may never have considered having an abortion themselves, or may never need an abortion \u2014 the proportion in favor of these models is extremely high,\u201d study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist researcher, said in an email to HuffPost. \u201cWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent.\u201d\n\nSince Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court put reproductive rights advocates on high alert about the future of Roe v. Wade, there has been a frenzy of activity around making self-induced abortion safer for women \u2014 particularly through increased access to the abortion pill.\n\nWhen we exclude the women who are morally and legally opposed to abortion rights, levels of support increase to 62 percent. Antonia Biggs, study author\n\nBefore Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in all 50 states in 1973, more than 1 million illegal abortions may have been performed in the United States each year \u2014 many of them deadly. American women went to Mexico to have surgical procedures, traveling alone in cars with strangers to see providers they knew nothing about. They used coat hangers and even drank bleach. The abortion pill has fundamentally changed the nature of so-called \u201cback alley\u201d abortions, but many reproductive rights advocates believe access is still far too limited.\n\nEarlier this fall, the founder of Women on Web \u2014 an organization that has long helped women outside of the United States perform their abortions at home \u2014 told The Atlantic she had been quietly shipping abortion pills to women in this country for more than six months through her new organization, Aid Access. Like Women on Web, it not only sells women the medications but also provides them with online consultations to walk them through the process.\n\nRight around that time, the Sia Legal Team \u2014 which works with women who have induced their own abortions \u2014 announced the launch of a free helpline for women who have been questioned by the police about ending their pregnancies (or who fear they might be), as well as a website with information about the legal landscape surrounding self-managed abortions. In some states, women have been prosecuted and jailed for attempting to terminate their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cBefore abortion was declared legal by the Supreme Court more than 40 years ago, finding a safe abortion was really difficult,\u201d Jill Adams, SIA\u2019s strategy director, told HuffPost. \u201cBut now people who can get abortion pills have a safe option to end a pregnancy on their own. In this scenario, and in this age, the risk is legal; it\u2019s not physical. The image of the coat hanger has been supplanted by the image of handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThere is research backing the safety of largely self-managed abortions, although these studies have not necessarily examined the safety of women going it entirely alone. A 2017 investigation found, for example, that abortions are just as safe when managed remotely via telemedicine as they are when a clinician actually watches a woman take the first pill.\n\nWhat this all means for the future of self-managed abortions in the United States is uncertain.\n\nIn an email to HuffPost, the Food and Drug Administration said it \u201ctakes the allegations related to the sale of mifepristone in the U.S. through online distribution channels very seriously and is evaluating the allegations to assess potential violations of U.S. law.\u201d The FDA said it was unable to discuss potential or pending investigations, if any exist.\n\nA spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the organization does not have an official stance on Aid Access, though it has urged the FDA to remove certain restrictions on where a woman is able to access mifepristone, given the medication\u2019s track record of safety and efficacy. The group has also come out strongly against the criminalization of women who end their pregnancies.\n\nBut the new survey suggests that interest from women is there.\n\n\u201cWe really knew little about the demand for and interest in alternative models (advance provision, online access, and over-the-counter access) of medication abortion provision,\u201d said Biggs, a researcher at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Amy Schumer Reveals She's Suffering From Hyperemesis Gravidarum", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-pregnancy-hyperemesis-gravidarum_us_5bedd783e4b0b50c4899ccab", "accessed_time": "2018-11-18 09:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Amy Schumer\u2019s pregnancy isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nThe comedian, who recently revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child with husband Chris Fischer, told her Instagram followers on Thursday that she\u2019s suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nThe condition, which Kate Middleton also dealt with in all three of her pregnancies, is marked by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dehydration during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI am in the hospital.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united.

But they also gave Mr. DeSantis more than enough material to portray him as a radical leftist out of step with a quintessential swing state.\n\nBut Mr. DeSantis struggled to gain momentum, and he trailed in the polls for much of the campaign after telling Fox News that Florida voters should not \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for Mr. Gillum. Critics saw the remark as a racist dog whistle, but Mr. DeSantis, who is white, said he had not intended it as a racial jab.\n\nThat was not the only racial episode during the campaign. In August, an Idaho-based white supremacist group placed racist robocalls to Florida voters in which a man claiming to be Mr. Gillum spoke in the exaggerated accent of a minstrel performer while monkeys screamed in the background. Both campaigns denounced the calls, which drew attention to Mr. DeSantis\u2019s earlier gaffe.\n\nThe negative attention on Mr. DeSantis\u2019s campaign lifted in the weeks before the election, when he named Susie Wiles, a veteran Republican operative, as his new campaign manager. He worked furiously to define Mr. Gillum as a proponent of \u201cideological radicalism\u201d and a \u201cGeorge Soros left-wing agenda\u201d who was out of step with the average Floridian.\n\nAnd he campaigned on a promise to support military veterans, defend a scholarship program that pays private school tuition for low-income students and appoint \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d judges to the State Supreme Court, a promise that echoed a similar one made on the campaign trail in 2016 by Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Gillum said on Saturday that he remained committed to pushing for societal change \u2014 if not as the next governor, then as an advocate.\n\n\u201cAlthough nobody wanted to be governor more than me, this was not just about an election cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government.

Mr. McCarthy, who will be the minority leader in the next Congress, after Democrats seized control of the House, helped champion a ballot initiative that would overturn a gasoline tax passed by the Legislature last year to pay for road repair. The initiative was intended to bring Republicans out to vote in these endangered Republican districts.\n\nThe initiative was defeated, and political analysts said the results suggested that any increase in Republican turnout caused by the gas tax was overwhelmed by turnout among Democratic voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had seized on California as a leading front of its battle to take back Congress, opening an office there in 2017, and flooding the district with money and workers.\n\nThe idea of making such an effort in Orange County \u2014 and in districts with a Republican registration edge \u2014 would have seemed unthinkable not long ago. But the area has been becoming Democratic in recent years, as it has become younger and more ethnically diverse.\n\nMrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes in California and won in Orange County. Republicans said the president\u2019s continued attacks on California since the election \u2014 along with his advocating tough immigration measures in the final weeks of the campaign \u2014 had created obstacles for Republican candidates already in a tough political environment.\n\nCalifornia Republicans have seen their enrollment in steady decline over the past 20 years. Some party members \u2014 led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor \u2014 have sought to push the party to moderate its positions on issues like immigration, in an effort to appeal to more voters.\n\nBut those efforts have largely been rebuffed; many of the Republican candidates for Congress in California this year \u2014 in particular, Representative Dana Rohrabacher and Representative Mimi Walters \u2014 stood by Mr. Trump through the election process.
