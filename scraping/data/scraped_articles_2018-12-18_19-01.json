They also said Flynn may continue to cooperate in a future trial.\n\nJudge Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said he was \"not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense.\"\n\n\"I want to be frank with you, this crime is very serious,\" Sullivan said. \"Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\"\n\n\"All along, you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the national security adviser to the President of the United States,\" Sullivan said. \"That undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably you sold your country out.\"\n\nSullivan later corrected himself, noting Flynn's foreign lobbying ended prior to the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nBoth sides now have until March 13 to file a status report with the court.\n\nFlynn left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.\n\nFlynn has given Mueller a key witness on some of the most scrutinized moments during the Trump campaign, transition and first month in the White House -- while also turning the former Army lieutenant general into a political cause backed by conservatives wary of Mueller's approach.\n\nTrump himself wished Flynn \"good luck\" in a Tuesday morning tweet, adding that it \"will be interesting to see what he has to say.\"\n\nGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2018\n\nDespite Flynn's admissions that he lied about three things -- including policy requests he made to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition -- Mueller's team has asked the judge to sentence Flynn to minimal or even no time.\n\nThree previous defendants in Mueller's probe -- Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- pleaded guilty to the same crime of lying. Each received sentences that included prison time. But none of those men helped investigators as broadly, willingly or sincerely as Flynn, Mueller's team has said.\n\nAnother defendant, former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, also pleaded guilty to a lying charge in Mueller's probe. He continues to cooperate with the investigation and has no set sentencing date.\n\nFBI's approach\n\nFlynn's sentencing has been shaded over the past three weeks by criticism of the FBI's actions when it first approached him in the White House on January 24, 2017.\n\nFlynn's defense team first raised the issue in a memo to Sullivan last week. The defense lawyers argued that Flynn should be spared jail time because he had lied under different circumstances than van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos, who had been warned they could be prosecuted for lying to the FBI.\n\nFlynn spoke to the FBI agents with no lawyer present and hadn't been warned of the potential legal consequences. He also did not involve the White House counsel's office, and the FBI did not involve the Justice Department in his interview.\n\nFlynn was so relaxed, investigators said, that they did not have the impression that he was lying during the interview, according to memos from the agents. Even so, the FBI knew that when Flynn said he hadn't asked for certain responses from Kislyak to the American sanctions against Russia or a United Nations Security Council resolution, he was lying.\n\nTuesday, Sullivan asked Flynn's attorney Stephen Anthony if the former national security adviser was \"entrapped by the FBI.\" Anthony said, \"No, your Honor.\"\n\nAnother FBI memo about the January 24, 2017, interview, released Monday night, further solidified that Flynn wrongly denied he had tried to influence the Russian government's reaction to sanctions and intentions at the UN.\n\nFlynn first met Kislyak in 2013 while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he had developed the relationship with the Russian government since then. Court documents made public last year show that members of Trump's transition team knew about Flynn's requests to the ambassador a month before the inauguration.\n\nFlynn is also central to the potential obstruction of justice case surrounding Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. According to a memo Comey wrote in February 2017, the President asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn.\n\nMueller's team has described on multiple occasions how Flynn misled members of the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak, which then prompted those public officials to share false information with the American public.\n\n'Could he have been charged with treason?'\n\nSullivan stunned the courtroom when he asked if Flynn conduct \"rises to the level of treasonous activity.\"\n\nProsecutor Brandon Van Grack, speaking for the special counsel's office, said prosecutors did not consider charging Flynn with treason.\n\nThen Sullivan asked again: \"Could he have been charged with treason?\"\n\nLater, Sullivan walked back his treason questions. \"I'm not suggesting\" Flynn committed treason, he said.\n\n\"I was just trying to determine the benefit and the generosity of the government,\" he said. \"Don't read too much into the questions I ask.\"\n\nSullivan's closing words to the courtroom were: \"Happy holidays.\"\n\nTurkey project\n\nAside from Flynn's conversations with the Russian, he admitted to lying about his lobbying work for the Turkish government as it sought to build American support for the extradition of a cleric and political opponent living in Pennsylvania.\n\nFlynn's two former business associates were indicted by the Justice Department on Monday for working on this project, which included Flynn authoring an op-ed in a Washington newspaper that sympathized with the current Turkish government and demonized the cleric. The op-ed published on Election Day 2016. The former business associates also accepted payments for the work through Flynn's company, the Flynn Intel Group, according to the charging document.\n\nOne of the men, Flynn Intel Group co-founder Bijan Rafiekian, also known as Bijan Kian, appeared in a Virginia courtroom Tuesday and plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent in the US.\n\nThe other defendant in the case, a Dutch-Turkish businessman, is charged with the same two crimes plus lying to the FBI. The businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, lives in Istanbul and has not appeared in US court.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Judge to Flynn: 'Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied' to senior Trump officials", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hkHHMnGk2fQ/h_c88a04c48d1b48aedf001a03635d16f2", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "Michael Flynn returned to the podium with his lawyers after Judge Emmet Sullivan wanted to ask him a few more questions.\n\n\"I believe I understand that\" there could be more cooperation needed from Flynn, Flynn said to the judge.

Flynn was once an admired Army Special Operations officer who went on to hold one of the most powerful jobs in the world as President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser.\n\nNow he is awaiting sentencing on December 18 for lying to the FBI. According to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's sentencing memo filed earlier this month, because of his extensive cooperation with investigators as well as his more than three decades of public service, prosecutors are requesting a minimal sentence, including the possibility of no jail time for Flynn.\n\nFlynn has spoken to prosecutors 19 times as part of his plea agreement, which underlines his value to Mueller as a witness because of his early involvement in the Trump campaign and the key role he played in the transition, all of which gives him important insights into the campaign's precise involvement with the Russians.\n\nHow did Flynn's long fall from grace happen? This story is based on interviews with multiple former colleagues of Flynn's in the military, as well as with his colleagues in the Trump White House. (I have also interviewed Flynn in the past, although he has not spoken to the media while awaiting sentencing.)\n\nAn intensely hard-working officer and effective leader\n\nDuring his military career few could have predicted the path that Flynn would eventually take. As a colonel in charge of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Flynn was a well-loved, effective team leader and an intensely hard-working officer who was constantly deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. Flynn used to joke that he lived at the JSOC base in Balad, Iraq, and took his vacations at the JSOC base in Bagram, Afghanistan.\n\nThe hours working for JSOC were brutal, 17-hour days every day of the week, but the mission was clear. Flynn and his boss, General Stanley McChrystal, understood by 2005 that the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that JSOC wasn't configured well enough to destroy the industrial strength insurgency it was facing, which was led by al Qaeda in Iraq.\n\nAl Qaeda in Iraq wasn't a traditional military opponent operating with a top-down bureaucratic hierarchy, but rather a loose network of like-minded jihadists. McChrystal's mantra became \"it takes a network to defeat a network.\"\n\nTo become a network, JSOC would have to get flatter and more agile. McChrystal and Flynn reconfigured JSOC so it communicated more seamlessly with all the components of the intelligence community and more quickly processed the intelligence gathered on raids so other raids could be immediately launched based on what was gleaned from the initial operation.\n\nThe results were startling; JSOC went from doing only four or five raids a month to doing hundreds every month, and al Qaeda in Iraq took a huge beating.\n\nIn 2012 Flynn, now promoted to lieutenant general, was appointed to run the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Flynn wanted to turn DIA into something more like JSOC with more analysts deployed \"forward\" in the war zones.\n\nThis was an excellent idea. After all, if you are supposed to be providing intelligence on a war, it helps if you are not working in an office 6,000 miles from where the conflict is actually happening. But DIA is a bureaucratic behemoth of some 17,000 employees, most of whom are quite happy living in the Washington, DC, area as opposed to, say, working for a year at Bagram Air Base in the windswept, mountainous deserts of Afghanistan.\n\nThe DIA desk jockeys pushed back against Flynn and his plans to deploy many of them to the war zones. Flynn had never commanded a giant organization like DIA. The first rule of bureaucratic politics is if you want to make big changes you need to enlist folks to help, Flynn didn't make much of an effort to do this at DIA, which ruffled bureaucratic feathers and irritated his bosses at the Pentagon and in the intelligence community.\n\n'Flynn facts' and conflicts with Obama team\n\nAt DIA, Flynn also began developing some eccentric notions. Flynn became convinced that the jihadist attack against the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 was orchestrated by Iran, which on the face of it made little sense since the Shia regime in Iran rarely cooperates with Sunni militants. There was also no evidence for this fanciful notion, but Flynn pushed his analysts at DIA to find a link that didn't exist.\n\nIt was Flynn's failures to distinguish between conjecture and truth that led analysts at DIA to coin the term \" Flynn facts .\"\n\nWhen Flynn was running DIA, the Obama administration's view of the terrorism threat was best encapsulated by President Obama's statement to New Yorker editor David Remnick in January 2014 that the group that would evolve into ISIS was merely a \"jay-vee\" team.\n\nFlynn had a far less sanguine view, warning that the global jihadist movement was not waning in the wake of Osama bin Laden's death, as was then the conventional analysis. Flynn made this case publicly in congressional testimony on February 11, 2014, when Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, asked him if al Qaeda was indeed on the run, as the Obama administration was claiming.\n\nA few months later, Flynn made a similar public statement at the Aspen Security Forum, an annual conference held in July in Aspen, Colorado, that attracts top US national security officials and the journalists who cover them.\n\nCNN's Evan Perez asked Flynn, \"Are we safer today than we were two years, five years, ten years ago?\"\n\n\"My quick answer is we're not,\" Flynn replied.\n\nFlynn went on to say that focusing only on the declining fortunes of \"core\" al Qaeda, the group that had attacked the United States on 9/11, was to gloss over the fact that jihadist ideology was in fact \"exponentially growing.\"\n\nAs ISIS conquered much of Iraq during the summer of 2014 and imposed its brutal, totalitarian rule, it was clear that Obama and his national security team had underestimated the strength of ISIS, while Flynn had understood the threat far better than many of his peers. But Flynn had angered his two bosses, Michael Vickers, the overall head of intelligence at the Pentagon, as well as James Clapper, the director of national intelligence.\n\nVickers and Clapper thought that Flynn trying to shake things up at DIA was actually sabotaging morale at the agency, according to Clapper's autobiography, \"Facts and Fears.\" They decided to force Flynn out of office a year early.\n\nFlynn in the civilian world\n\nFlynn seems to have been both bitter and embarrassed about the way he had been fired. In his own mind he was forced out because he wasn't playing along with the Obama administration line that the war on terror was largely over, according to his autobiography, \"The Field of Fight.\" For Vickers and Clapper, it was much simpler: They fired him because he was a bad manager.\n\nEither way Flynn, a highly decorated officer with 33 years service in the army, much of it in Special Operations, at the age of 55 had his career abruptly ended -- and in an inglorious manner to boot.\n\nPerhaps by way of compensation, once he was out in the civilian world, Flynn wanted to show that he was a rainmaker. Flynn set up Flynn Intel Group, which took on all manner of clients, a number of them with links to foreign governments.\n\nOut of some combination of naivet\u00e9 and arrogance Flynn, the maverick who came out of the \"special\" insular world of Joint Special Operation Command, did not play by the rules when it came to the lobbying work he did for some of his foreign clients, for which he was supposed to register officially as an agent of a foreign government. In Flynn's sentencing memo, the Special Counsel says that Flynn misrepresented his work on behalf of the Turkish government for which he and his company were paid more than half a million dollars.\n\nFlynn also began dipping his toe into politics. After meeting with Donald Trump in August 2015 Flynn came away deeply impressed. Trump was a good listener; he asked smart questions and he seemed truly worried about the direction that the country was heading, according to an interview Flynn gave to The Washington Post.\n\nFlynn became a prominent presence on the Trump campaign and a vocal critic of Obama's supposedly \"weak\" policies on ISIS. This, of course, dovetailed very neatly with what Trump was saying.\n\nFlynn's support of Trump was all the more important because he was the only person on Trump's campaign team with any experience of America's post-9/11 wars that continued to grind on at various levels of intensity in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.\n\nLike Trump, Flynn thought that the United States could work with Putin and even sat next to the Russian president at a gala dinner in Moscow in December 2015 that celebrated the 10th anniversary of Russia Today (RT), the Kremlin-sponsored TV network, an appearance for which Flynn was handsomely paid . The Russians, through his speaking agency, gave Flynn $33,750.\n\nFlynn later told a Washington Post reporter that this wasn't a big deal, as RT was similar to CNN, a bizarre claim given that RT is effectively an arm of the Kremlin.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Trump started to seriously consider Flynn as a possible candidate to be his running mate. The three-star general would certainly help on the commander in chief issue. At the time, the leading candidates to be Trump's running mate were former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Flynn. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was seen as only a distant possibility for the number two-slot on the ticket, according to a senior Trump campaign official.\n\nFlynn made his first, big appearance on the public stage when he made a fiery speech of support for Trump at the Republican convention in Cleveland on July 19, 2016. Flynn angrily charged Obama and Clinton with endangering the United States and even lying about the nature of the terrorist threat: \"Tonight, Americans stand as one with strength and confidence to overcome the last eight years of the Obama-Clinton failures such as bumbling indecisiveness, willful ignorance, and total incompetence...Because Obama chose to conceal the actions of terrorists like Osama bin Laden and groups like ISIS, and the role of Iran in the rise of radical Islam, Americans are at a loss to fully understand the enormous threat they pose against us.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Flynn led the crowd in chants of \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" and incited them, \"Get fired up! This is about this country!\"\n\nFlynn declared, \"I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server.\"\n\nThe crowd started chanting, \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\"\n\nHesitating only slightly, Flynn added his voice to the chants declaring, \"Lock her up, that's right! Damn right, exactly right. And you know why we're saying that? We're saying that because, if I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth of what [Clinton] did, I would be in jail today.\"\n\nOfficers who had served with Flynn were dismayed and puzzled by this performance, which went against their code not to take such clearly partisan positions, even in retirement. The angry man on stage didn't seem like the Mike Flynn they knew.\n\nGrowing enamored of neoconservatives and right-wing ideologues\n\nSome of his peers felt Flynn had succumbed to a case of \"Obama Derangement Syndrome\" after he was fired from running the Defense Intelligence Agency. That might be a partial explanation for Flynn's impassioned rhetoric against Obama and Clinton, but in the years after he was pushed out of the military Flynn had also became enamored of leading neoconservatives and right-wing ideologues.\n\nFlynn coauthored a book, \"Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies.\" with Michael Ledeen, a neoconservative academic who was a longtime, bitter critic of the Iranian regime. In \"Field of Fight,\" which was published just before the Republican convention, Flynn claimed the United States was in a world war with \"radical Islam,\" which it was losing. Flynn also claimed that American Islamists were trying to create \"an Islamic state right here at home.\" This is a common conspiracy theory of the far right.\n\nFlynn also wrote for the New York Post about a supposed \"enemy alliance\" that included Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela as well as al Qaeda, ISIS and the Taliban. This was George W. Bush's \"axis of evil\" on steroids and scarcely more convincing since ISIS and Iran were at war, as were al Qaeda and ISIS, and none of these terrorist groups had any relationship with the North Koreans or with leftist regimes in Latin America.\n\nAt the same time Flynn became increasingly gripped by rightist conspiracy theories. In August 2016 Flynn claimed in a speech that Democratic members of the Florida legislature were trying to install Sharia law in their state. This was, of course, nonsense.\n\nFlynn also tweeted that fear of Muslims was \"rational\" and publicly said that Islam was really a \"political ideology\" rather than a religion. When he was in uniform, Flynn had never made these kinds of assertions about Muslims and Islam.\n\nFlynn's inability to distinguish easily between facts and obvious falsehoods seemed to worsen as the presidential campaign continued. Flynn claimed in an interview with Breitbart News that there wer e Arabic signs along the United States-Mexico border to guide potential terrorists into the States and that he had seen evidence of these signs. Flynn said, \"I have personally seen the photos of the signage along those paths that are in Arabic. They're like waypoints along that path as you come in. Primarily, in this case the one that I saw was in Texas and it's literally, it's like signs, that say, in Arabic, 'This way, move to this point.' It's unbelievable.\" It was unbelievable because it was completely false.\n\nUnexpected victory\n\nThat Flynn seemed to have never really expected Trump to win the election was underlined by an article written by Flynn that appeared in The Hill newspaper on Election Day 2016 that compared Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in in exile in Pennsylvania, to Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nFor the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Gulen was an obsession. It had fingered Gulen for purportedly masterminding a botched military coup in Turkey in the summer of 2016.\n\nFlynn's article suggested that Gulen, who had very good reasons to fear for his safety if he ever returned to Turkey, should not be allowed to remain in the United States.\n\nNo one who really thought he would be the next US national security adviser would have published such a provocative piece in a relatively obscure publication the very same day that his candidate was elected to the most powerful job in the world.\n\nThe article also risked drawing attention to the fact that Flynn's consulting firm had been paid more than half a million dollars by a company close to the Erdogan government, despite the fact that Flynn hadn't registered as an agent of a foreign government as is required by law.\n\nFlynn's positions and actions during the campaign and the transition were not those of the typical national security adviser, but then nor were the president-elect's.\n\nTwo days after Trump was elected president, Obama sat down with Trump in the Oval Office and, among other matters, warned Trump against hiring Flynn in any senior role.\n\nA week after meeting with Obama, though, Trump offered Flynn the key job of national security adviser. Flynn's loyalty to Trump and early support for him trumped questions about his temperament as well as his lack of experience managing the complex national security bureaucracy -- and the fact that he had never worked at the White House.\n\nFor more opinion...

The reason given: that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence, telling him that during the transition he hadn't discussed lifting Obama-era sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States, when in fact he had. This lie appears to have been an effort to cover up the fact that Flynn was conducting substantive American foreign policy before he was ever in office. The United States operates on the principle that there is only one president at a time.\n\nFlynn repeated the lies about the Russian ambassador to the FBI and compounded his legal jeopardy by lying about his links to the Turkish government in documents filed with the U.S. government, according to Tuesday's sentencing memo.\n\nThose actions completed Flynn's fall from grace.

I want my witnesses to have a chance to tell what they saw,\" she said in a letter to her attorney.\n\nLawyers who handle sexual misconduct allegations said plea deals are common in such cases, and cautioned against rushing to judgment without knowing the context for the outcome.\n\nBut because the case never went to trial, the public may never fully understand the state of evidence that led to the outcome -- and that's more concerning to some lawyers than the actual plea bargain that spared the former fraternity president jail time or sex offender registration.\n\nJacob Walter Anderson was indicted on four counts of sexual assault in 2016 based on allegations that he drugged and raped a 19-year-old sophomore at a fraternity party. In her victim impact statement, the woman accused Anderson of forcing himself on her repeatedly as she blacked out and then leaving her unconscious \"face down in the dirt.\"\n\nAnderson's lawyers released a statement on Friday saying they had never seen a case with so many misrepresentations of what occurred. They said the encounter was consensual and called the victim's claims that he choked her and left her for dead \"fabrications\" that she only reported two years after the incident. Her lawyer did not return a request for a response to the defense statement.\n\nAnderson was expelled from Baylor after a campus Title IX investigation, a university spokeswoman said. While a student at the University of Texas at Dallas , he pleaded no contest in October to a lesser charge of unlawful restraint in an agreement with the McLennan County District Attorney's office.\n\nIn exchange for his plea, Anderson was offered deferred adjudication probation -- meaning he won't spend a day in jail, and his record will be expunged in three years if he pays a $400 fine and submits to psychological, alcohol and drug treatment. Judge Ralph Strother approved the plea last week in state court in Waco, sparking criticism that the outcome was too lenient given the allegations.\n\nThe news prompted an online petition calling on UTD to remove him from campus, followed by the school's announcement that it was banning an unnamed student fitting his profile from commencement activities.\n\nOutgoing District Attorney Abelino \"Abel\" Reyna stood by the outcome, saying the plea \"achieved the best result possible with the evidence at hand.\" His office declined to comment for this story.\n\nMcLennan County district attorney Abel Reyna retires at the end of the year.\n\nWithout a trial to lay out all the evidence for a jury to scrutinize, the public is wont to jump to conclusions -- especially in a case with such a wide disparity between the alleged conduct and the severity of the punishment, said defense attorney Gloria Allred. She is not affiliated with the case, but she has represented sexual assault accusers in high-profile cases, including Bill Cosby's accusers.\n\nMore troubling, Allred and other lawyers said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office never consulted her regarding the plea, and why the prosecutor told her she offered the plea.\n\nAllred worries that the outcome will deter crime victims from coming forward when victim cooperation is critical to successful prosecutions.\n\n\"Nobody can require a prosecutor to take a case to trial. Nor can they prevent (a prosecutor) from taking a case to trial,\" she said. \"But there seems to be such a disconnect between what the victim said happened and the sentence that naturally the public is going to have a lot of questions, and it's not helpful when we don't know the evidence.\"\n\nHere's what lawyers who spoke to CNN urged the public to keep in mind when evaluating plea bargains in sexual assault cases.\n\nWhy a case might end in a plea to lesser charges\n\nPlea bargains for reduced sentences are common in sexual assault cases, said the president of the national Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and five defense lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nSuch cases can be tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, they said -- especially when they lack witnesses or corroborating evidence, or if they hinge on consent.\n\nCleveland-based lawyers Susan Stone and Kristina Supler specialize in student disciplinary matters and Title IX investigations. They represent students and professors accused of misconduct as partners and co-chairs of Kohrman Jackson & Krantz Education Law and Student Defense Practice Group.\n\nStone called Anderson's case a \"thoroughly typical\" example of how criminal cases proceed through the system.\n\n\"The reality is, on a regular basis, cases are charged with various offenses, felonies and misdemeanors, and through the process in the legal system, charges are amended and the parties agree to a plea,\" she said. \"What I can tell you is, rarely a case ends the way it is charged.\"\n\nThe nature of sexual assault allegations tends to elicit an emotional response from the public that's hard to set aside, Supler said. But when a prosecutor offers a plea deal or declines to press charges, it's usually because they don't believe they have sufficient evidence to convince a jury of a defendant's guilt -- and the public is not privy to everything the prosecutor knows.\n\n\"What a lot of people who are not lawyers may have a hard time understanding is that, when there is a plea, it's because there are problems with the evidence and the prosecutors can't prosecute their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nProsecutors in the Baylor case indicated there were possible evidence problems. Assistant District Attorney Hilary LaBorde wrote in a letter to the victim and her parents that \"conflicting evidence and statements\" in Anderson's case made \"the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"Any lawyer can issue a statement, but taking a statement and proving the truth of its contents beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, when a complaining witness is subject to cross examination, is a different task entirely,\" she said in a separate statement after the plea was accepted.\n\n\"Given the claims made publicly, I understand why people are upset. However, all of the facts must be considered and there are many facts that the public does not have. In approving this agreement, Judge Strother had access to all the statements that have ever been made by all people involved and agreed that the plea agreement offered was appropriate in this case.\"\n\nCNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said it's hard for him to believe that a prosecutor would \"give away\" a viable case in the era of #MeToo, when sexual misconduct allegations are being taken more seriously than in previous years. He urged those who are critical of the judge to consider that the district attorney's office made the offer in the first place.\n\n\"If a prosecutor made the offer, either she's completely out of touch or she realized there are problems with the proof in their case,\" he said.\n\nLittle to no jail time is common for first-time offenders\n\nThe victim in the case decried the plea for shielding Anderson from time in custody, alleging that he may continue to prey on women.\n\n\"Jacob Anderson will most likely rape again. He is now free to roam society, stalk women and no one will know he is a sex offender. Jacob Anderson and all rapists who get away with their crimes will never be cured, never change. If anything they will be emboldened by their power over women and their ability to escape justice and punishment,\" she said in her victim impact statement.\n\nBut little to no jail time is common for first-time offenders who have had no prior contact with the criminal justice system, said the lawyers who spoke with CNN.\n\nWhen prosecutors consider charges, they look at the evidence and whether they can prove the allegations, said David LaBahn, president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Then, prosecutors look at the offender to determine the outcome that will balance justice for victims with long-term goals such as public safety and reducing the likelihood of reoffending, he said.\n\nState District Court Judge Ralph Strother accepted a plea agreement by former Baylor University fraternity president Jacob Anderson.\n\nFor first-time offenders who are not considered imminent threats to the public, prosecutors and judges are encouraged to consider alternatives to incarceration, such as treatment or diversionary programs, in the hopes that their first offense will be their last, LaBahn said.\n\nWith detention centers overcrowded, he said, imprisonment should be reserved for society's most dangerous offenders and the focus should be on rehabilitating offenders to end the cycle of violence.\n\n\"You cannot arrest, prosecute and jail yourself out of criminal justice problems ... you need to address the cause,\" he said. \"If you can address the cause, you reduce the criminality, but until you address the cause, the criminality is going to continue.\"\n\nWhat about the victim's rights?\n\nMore concerning than the plea itself, LaBahn said, is the victim's claim that the district attorney's office did not consult her before offering it to Anderson. Most states, including Texas , have a victims' bill of rights enshrined in state law, which affords them the opportunity to be notified about decisions regarding an offender.\n\n\"It's hard to know whether a result is proper or not without knowing the specific context,\" he said.\n\n\"But the treatment of the victim, that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe victim and her family learned about the plea deal in the media, a fact the prosecutor in the case later apologized for in a letter to them. But the victim was unassuaged.\n\n\"I have been waiting two and a half years for this trial. I have been through hell and back and my life has been forever turned upside down. I feel like I should have the right to the trial for the four counts of sexual assault the grand jury indicted him on,\" she wrote her lawyer.\n\n\"She (the prosecutor) has not kept me informed and has not discussed the plea with me at any time, other than to say she would not offer him one. I was furious and devastated when I read the newspaper article that she was basically dropping the sexual assault charges. And then in utter shock when her reason was because she lost a completely different case so she didn't trust a jury to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn her letter, prosecutor LaBorde said that a jury's verdict of not guilty in another rape case influenced her decision. She said the jury in the previous trial \"engaged in a lot of victim blaming,\" treatment that she thought the victim in Anderson's case would also experience because the behavior of the two victims was similar.\n\n\"It's my opinion that our jurors aren't ready to blame rapists and not victims when there isn't concrete proof of more than one victim. I have had success in trying college aged defendants yes, but in retrospect, ONLY when they have multiple victims,\" she wrote. \"Multiple victims put the focus properly on the criminal's conduct. That didn't happen when there was only one victim and one event to talk about.\"\n\nThough it's not clear exactly which similarities she was referring to, in the previous case against a defendant named Hunter Morgan, the victim had the defendant's DNA in her underwear and injuries to her genitals, LaBorde wrote. In Anderson's case, his lawyers said no DNA evidence links him to the incident.\n\nIn her letter, LaBorde also referred to the strength of the medical evidence regarding the injuries the victim experienced as a virgin, saying her injuries were more likely to be explained away because such injuries are common when someone has her first sexual encounter.\n\n\"The research suggests that victims with no sexual experience are more likely to be injured because a sexual encounter is their first,\" LaBorde wrote. \"So medically speaking, (this victim's) innocence and lack of experience makes the medical evidence less helpful.\"\n\nLaBorde also raised differences between the defendants that she thought might make a jury more sympathetic to Anderson.\n\n\"I actually thought the Hunter Morgan case was stronger than Jacob Anderson's because Morgan admitted the victim was intoxicated, too intoxicated to consent, and he admitted he wasn't intoxicated at all,\" she wrote. \"One weakness I've always identified with Anderson is that he was drinking also -- and although I think he's exaggerating -- he acts as though he was extremely intoxicated at the time he was at the frat party.\"\n\nThe decision to not go to trial\n\nAllred said the leniency Anderson experienced was \"more of the same\" in a criminal justice system that gives defendants in sexual assault cases the benefit of the doubt over the accuser.\n\nThe prosecutor's statements about why she chose not to go to trial show how the system has failed to keep up with the cultural reckoning prompted by #MeToo, Allred said.\n\nAllred acknowledged that proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt is an uphill battle. But she questioned the prosecutor making her decision to not try the case based on past outcomes, she said, because each case is different.\n\nAnd if past jurors have shown a tendency to blame victims, she said, it's a prosecutor's job to call witnesses and present evidence to dispel myths about how victims behave after experiencing a traumatic event.\n\n\"There's only one way we're going be able to move forward, and that's if juries are educated on what to expect from a victim,\" she said. \"That's a better alternative than saying, 'We can't go to trial because they may blame her or shame her.'\"\n\nThe victim shared similar concerns in her letter to her lawyer.\n\n\"This is the reason rape victims hesitate to report the crime. I had the courage to report the crime, go through an investigation, wait all these years to testify I have had to courage to keep on living so that I can testify.\"\n\nAnderson's case drew comparisons to the trial of former Stanford University athlete Brock Turner, who spent three months behind bars after a judge went against a prosecutor's recommendation for a harsher sentence. In Turner's case, it was clear that the sentence was \"awful but lawful,\" LaBahn said, because evidence and witness testimony was presented in open court. But in Anderson's case, the truth is less clear, he said.\n\nEven when the evidence isn't so clear cut, LaBahn said there's merit to bringing a case to a grand jury or to trial if it's what the victim wants: It allows them to have their day in court.\n\n\"I would like this not to become a situation where others don't report based on the outcome of this case,\" he said. \"Each case is different, and we really do need the victim's involvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "Judge sentences poacher to year in jail -- and makes him watch Bambi monthly", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/tpsYVugYcy0/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Missouri judge is turning to Walt Disney to make sure David Berry Jr. never illegally hunts again.\n\nBerry's sentencing is the latest event in one of the state's largest poaching cases.\n\nLawrence County Judge Robert George sentenced Berry to a year in jail for illegally killing deer, taking only their heads and antlers and leaving the rest of their bodies to rot.

She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Michael Flynn sentencing postponed after dramatic hearing", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/nNKR3zq5-LY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:08", "body_paragraphs": "Washington (CNN) The sentencing for President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn was postponed until 2019 after a dramatic federal court hearing Tuesday.\n\nFlynn, who pleaded guilty last year, said \"I was aware\" that lying to the FBI was a crime, but prosecutors from special counsel Robert Mueller's office had called for him to get little to no jail time because he has cooperated extensively. They also said Flynn may continue to cooperate in a future trial.\n\nJudge Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said he was \"not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense.\"\n\n\"I want to be frank with you, this crime is very serious,\" Sullivan said. \"Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\"\n\n\"All along, you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the national security adviser to the President of the United States,\" Sullivan said. \"That undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably you sold your country out.\"\n\nSullivan later corrected himself, noting Flynn's foreign lobbying ended prior to the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nBoth sides now have until March 13 to file a status report with the court.\n\nFlynn left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.\n\nFlynn has given Mueller a key witness on some of the most scrutinized moments during the Trump campaign, transition and first month in the White House -- while also turning the former Army lieutenant general into a political cause backed by conservatives wary of Mueller's approach.\n\nTrump himself wished Flynn \"good luck\" in a Tuesday morning tweet, adding that it \"will be interesting to see what he has to say.\"\n\nGood luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 18, 2018\n\nDespite Flynn's admissions that he lied about three things -- including policy requests he made to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition -- Mueller's team has asked the judge to sentence Flynn to minimal or even no time.\n\nThree previous defendants in Mueller's probe -- Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen, the Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos -- pleaded guilty to the same crime of lying. Each received sentences that included prison time. But none of those men helped investigators as broadly, willingly or sincerely as Flynn, Mueller's team has said.\n\nAnother defendant, former Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, also pleaded guilty to a lying charge in Mueller's probe. He continues to cooperate with the investigation and has no set sentencing date.\n\nFBI's approach\n\nFlynn's sentencing has been shaded over the past three weeks by criticism of the FBI's actions when it first approached him in the White House on January 24, 2017.\n\nFlynn's defense team first raised the issue in a memo to Sullivan last week. The defense lawyers argued that Flynn should be spared jail time because he had lied under different circumstances than van der Zwaan and Papadopoulos, who had been warned they could be prosecuted for lying to the FBI.\n\nFlynn spoke to the FBI agents with no lawyer present and hadn't been warned of the potential legal consequences. He also did not involve the White House counsel's office, and the FBI did not involve the Justice Department in his interview.\n\nFlynn was so relaxed, investigators said, that they did not have the impression that he was lying during the interview, according to memos from the agents. Even so, the FBI knew that when Flynn said he hadn't asked for certain responses from Kislyak to the American sanctions against Russia or a United Nations Security Council resolution, he was lying.\n\nTuesday, Sullivan asked Flynn's attorney Stephen Anthony if the former national security adviser was \"entrapped by the FBI.\" Anthony said, \"No, your Honor.\"\n\nAnother FBI memo about the January 24, 2017, interview, released Monday night, further solidified that Flynn wrongly denied he had tried to influence the Russian government's reaction to sanctions and intentions at the UN.\n\nFlynn first met Kislyak in 2013 while director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he had developed the relationship with the Russian government since then. Court documents made public last year show that members of Trump's transition team knew about Flynn's requests to the ambassador a month before the inauguration.\n\nFlynn is also central to the potential obstruction of justice case surrounding Trump's interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. According to a memo Comey wrote in February 2017, the President asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn.\n\nMueller's team has described on multiple occasions how Flynn misled members of the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak, which then prompted those public officials to share false information with the American public.\n\n'Could he have been charged with treason?'\n\nSullivan stunned the courtroom when he asked if Flynn conduct \"rises to the level of treasonous activity.\"\n\nProsecutor Brandon Van Grack, speaking for the special counsel's office, said prosecutors did not consider charging Flynn with treason.\n\nThen Sullivan asked again: \"Could he have been charged with treason?\"\n\nLater, Sullivan walked back his treason questions. \"I'm not suggesting\" Flynn committed treason, he said.\n\n\"I was just trying to determine the benefit and the generosity of the government,\" he said. \"Don't read too much into the questions I ask.\"\n\nSullivan's closing words to the courtroom were: \"Happy holidays.\"\n\nTurkey project\n\nAside from Flynn's conversations with the Russian, he admitted to lying about his lobbying work for the Turkish government as it sought to build American support for the extradition of a cleric and political opponent living in Pennsylvania.\n\nFlynn's two former business associates were indicted by the Justice Department on Monday for working on this project, which included Flynn authoring an op-ed in a Washington newspaper that sympathized with the current Turkish government and demonized the cleric. The op-ed published on Election Day 2016. The former business associates also accepted payments for the work through Flynn's company, the Flynn Intel Group, according to the charging document.\n\nOne of the men, Flynn Intel Group co-founder Bijan Rafiekian, also known as Bijan Kian, appeared in a Virginia courtroom Tuesday and plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy and illegally acting as a foreign agent in the US.\n\nThe other defendant in the case, a Dutch-Turkish businessman, is charged with the same two crimes plus lying to the FBI.

At times, Flynn offered the FBI agents more benign descriptions of what he and Kislyak had said about Russian policy.\n\nIn all, the newly released memo shows clear examples of Flynn denying he had made policy requests of Russia, and the agents prodding him toward fuller descriptions of the calls.\n\nThe release of the memo Monday night -- on the eve of Flynn's criminal sentencing for lying to investigators -- sets up a clearer picture of what he said to the FBI agents in January 2017.

He will likely face zero to six months in prison, though Mueller's team has asked the judge to give him no prison time because he has helped their investigation, along with other federal probes.\n\nWhether the FBI decided Flynn was lying at that moment has become a touch point in President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Mueller investigation. Trump has latched on to whether Mueller pursued Flynn on a criminal charge at odds with the FBI's initial findings. Former FBI agent Peter Strzok's participation in the Flynn interview -- and the fact that Flynn was not warned he could be prosecuted for lying and had no lawyer in the room with him when he met with the FBI at the White House -- has also cast political shadows on the case.\n\nTrump has alleged the FBI determined that day that Flynn hadn't lied. Yet the memo from January 24, 2017, that was released Monday night does not say the FBI agents made any determinations at that time. The memo only outlines what Flynn said in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe subsequent criminal complaint, filed by Mueller's office in December 2017, outlined how Flynn's retelling of the conversations was wrong.\n\nA memo released by Mueller's office last week described how the FBI had known the facts of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak before the agency approached him in the West Wing. A separate memo filed with the court last week summarized how Strzok recalled he \"had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying.\"\n\nTwo lies\n\nThe memo describes how Flynn downplayed the approach he had taken in his discussions with Kislyak when FBI agents asked about the discussions in the January 2017 interview. He told the agents that \"no,\" he had not sought to influence Russia's vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution about Israeli settlements.\n\nBut investigators knew, according to charging documents filed last year, that Flynn had asked for Russia to vote against or delay the resolution.\n\nFlynn's second lie, as described in the FBI memo, came in response to the agents asking him about the US's expulsion of Russian diplomats or closing Russian properties following the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election. They asked him if he had encouraged Kislyak not to retaliate.\n\n\"Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.' It wasn't, 'Don't do anything,' \" the memo said.\n\nBut the FBI knew that Flynn had asked Russia on that call not to escalate its response to the US.\n\nThat call came among a series of phone calls between Flynn and Trump officials, including some who were at Mar-a-Lago along with the President-elect. Those calls between Trump advisers and Flynn were revealed in Flynn's charging document and not described in the January 2017 FBI memo released Monday.\n\nFlynn made the calls around Christmas 2016 from the Dominican Republic, where he was vacationing with his wife. Kislyak had texted Flynn on December 28, 2016, asking him to call, which set off the series of calls in the following days.\n\nThe FBI memo also describes Flynn's interactions with Russian officials, trips to the country and the relationship he developed with Kislyak through when he became national security adviser. Those events date back to 2013, when he was the first Defense Intelligence Agency director to visit the Russian military intelligence headquarters, and another visit years later.\n\nTwice in late 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to express condolences, after the assassination of a Russian ambassador in Turkey and the crash of a Russian military plane.\n\n\"Flynn does not know if Putin and Trump will get along, but it is Flynn's job to figure out paths to work with Russia to fight terrorism,\" the FBI memo said.\n\nThis story has been updated."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump Foundation agrees to dissolve under court supervision", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/bRvp5s_a_B8/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The Donald J.

On the call were representatives from the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the National Network of Abortion Funds\n\nThey spoke of the more than 400-and-counting restrictions to abortion access that have been enacted at the state level since 2010 and vowed that this is not a time to stop fighting. Even though Roe v. Wade remains on the books, they said, some states forge ahead as if it has been overturned. They also discussed how barriers to abortion access effectively prohibit the procedure for many, especially for low-income populations, people of color and younger people.\n\n\"Even today,\" said Jennifer Davlen, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , \"the constitutional right to abortion is more theoretical than real.\"\n\nCourt rulings that deny restrictions simply get ignored or appealed, said Julie Rikelman, senior director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nShe said Louisiana, which has only three abortion clinics, is trying to enact laws to close clinics that are identical to a Texas effort that was struck down by the Supreme Court two years ago in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt.\n\nBy instituting \"systematic barriers,\" states are chipping away at what should be protected, said Rachel Sussman, national director of state policy and advocacy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America\n\nThat means the threat to Roe v. Wade remains strong, even as the support of it has grown, they said. Several mentioned a Gallup Poll from the summer that showed nearly two-thirds of Americans -- or 64% -- want to uphold the 1973 Supreme Court decision, including 41% of Republicans.\n\nSussman pointed out how three states -- Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan -- kicked out anti-abortion governors. And other states, including New York, Rhode Island and New Mexico, worked to codify protections for abortion access.\n\n\"Voters did their jobs at the polls,\" she said. \"Now, we're going to get to work to put their will into action.\"\n\nThe US Supreme Court announced this month that it would not take up a case that might have stopped Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the court chose to honor two lower court decisions that prohibited cuts to funding in Kansas and Louisiana. The high court's decision was backed by new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, making some wonder whether he might not be as conservative as anticipated.\n\nHe and Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to side with the court's liberals, signaling an effort to avoid high-profile abortion-related issues for now.\n\nThat said, both justices \"likely have serious objections,\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \"But such votes seem to be a signal that they would rather avoid contentious, high-profile disputes for now, at least where possible.\"\n\nA representative from Planned Parenthood insisted Monday that this was a case about Medicaid, not abortion, and that Kavanaugh's \"troubling record\" showed he couldn't be trusted.\n\nSteven Aden, chief legal officer and legal counsel at Americans United for Life, also refused to take the Supreme Court decision as a sign.\n\n\"We're not drawing any conclusions,\" he said. \"There are a number of reasons why the court could have elected not to take the case.\"\n\nAmericans United for Life is a national anti-abortion group that uses legislation, education and litigation to advance its cause. Aden said he's looking ahead with optimism, focusing on the legislative issues and fights that he imagines down the pipeline.\n\nSpecifically, he highlighted four model pieces of legislation his organization has written that he hopes will gain traction next year across the country.\n\nThe Abortion Reporting Act seeks to require reporting of all abortion-related complications and emergencies, the idea being that the procedure is \"practiced in the dark,\" Aden said. \"Only when such a system is in place will we finally be able to unmask the reality of abortion in America.\"\n\nThe Women's Health Defense Act seeks to ban abortions at or after 20 weeks of gestation, except in some cases of medical emergency. \"Abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more dangerous to a woman than carrying to term,\" he said.\n\nThe Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act forbids selective abortions \"seeking to target babies,\" Aden said, based on prenatal diagnostic testing that shows the gender of the baby or a diagnosis such as Down syndrome.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLastly, Aden pointed to the Unborn Infants Dignity Act, which he said \"treats human lives in the womb as just that, human,\" and requires \"cremation or proper burial\" of \"miscarried, stillborn or aborted infants\" and protection from \"scientific experimentation.\"\n\nAll of these efforts are precisely what proponents of abortion access are preparing to address.

And the majority of patients will experience no meaningful benefit.\n\nThose benefits also tend to decrease over time and come with the risk of side effects such as vomiting and constipation, according to the review of nearly 100 randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Down the line, risks may include physical dependence and overdose.\n\n\"The benefits of opioids for managing chronic pain tend to be quite modest,\" said study author Jason Busse, associate professor in the department of anesthesia at McMaster University's school of medicine in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSubgroups of the studies included in the analysis suggest that non-opioid alternatives -- such as NSAIDs, certain antidepressants and medical cannabis -- may offer similar benefits to opioids on average. But the evidence for that is less strong, Busse said.\n\nThe analysis comes as federal agencies and other officials in recent years have been cracking down on the prescription of opioids, dually recognized as an important tool in the treatment of pain and as a gateway to physical dependence and addiction.\n\nIn 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines urging doctors to prescribe these drugs more responsibly for people with chronic pain. But Busse said the CDC report set the bar for placebo-controlled studies too high in its analysis; it looked for studies that followed up with patients for at least a year, of which there were none.\n\n\"We have looked at a lot of additional evidence that was not considered by the CDC guidelines,\" he said.\n\nDr. Jianguo Cheng, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said the new analysis reinforces what's become conventional wisdom among pain specialists. He was not involved in the study.\n\n\"We're going to try the least risky drug first, so therefore opioids [are] not a first line of treatment in most cases,\" said Cheng, also the director of director of the Cleveland Clinic Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Program. \"It's not a second line of treatment, and maybe not a third line of treatment.\"\n\nThe CDC describes chronic pain as \"lasting longer than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing.\" It is among the top reasons for seeking medical care in the US, affecting just over 20% of adults -- about 50 million people -- in 2016, according to one report this year. Other estimates suggest that the number is twice that.\n\n\"It's a very complicated and diverse population of patients,\" Cheng said, including those who may have suffered injuries, had multiple surgeries or live with disability.\n\nThis is differentiated from other kinds of pain, such as acute pain and cancer pain. For the latter, Cheng said, the use of opioids is far less controversial.\n\nJust because most of these patients won't see meaningful improvements, however, is not to ignore the subset that will experience them, Busse said.\n\n\"A problematic interpretation of [the study findings] would be: Opioids don't provide any meaningful pain relief,\" he said. \"The challenge with that interpretation is it assumes that every patient will get the same amount of pain relief.\"\n\nHis study estimates how many chronic pain patients a doctor would need to treat in order for one to experience meaningful improvements: For pain, it's roughly eight patients. For physical functioning, it's 12 patients. For sleep quality, 17 patients.\n\nAnd this is the \"best case scenario,\" according to an editorial published in the same journal by doctors with the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.\n\nThe studies included in the analysis largely weeded out patients with past or present substance use disorder, which Busse described as \"selecting patients that would be prognostically better off.\" Nearly half of the studies excluded patients who were diagnosed with or treated for mental illness, as well.\n\nMore than three-quarters of studies in the analysis were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the study points out. Other research has shown that industry-funded studies tend to produce better outcomes across a variety of fields.\n\nIn recent years, pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for aggressively marketing opioids to doctors. Leading up to the early 2000s, opioids were seen as a wonder drug , and doctors were urged to treat pain more aggressively. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in an open letter that doctors were taught that these medications were not addictive if patients were in \"legitimate pain.\" Multiple studies have shown this to be false.\n\n2013 study estimated that one in five patients who see a doctor for acute or chronic noncancer pain get prescribed opioids.\n\nAnother study last year supported a push by the CDC and other health experts to taper chronic pain patients off opioids when possible, saying they may have a better quality of life without them. But Cheng says this should be done carefully and may not work immediately for all patients, adding, \"I have seen many patients abandoned by their physicians, and they cannot find the people to manage their pain.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAccording to Cheng, alternative treatments that may be effective -- such as physical and cognitive behavioral therapies -- can also be out of reach for many patients, in some cases because insurance doesn't reimburse these services.\n\nHowever, despite gaps in knowledge of treating chronic pain, experts say opioids are part of that arsenal -- even if they come with risks and benefits that need to be better understood.\n\n\"For individuals who are suffering with unrelenting chronic pain every day of their lives, if they've tried other alternatives that haven't worked, they may in some cases decide they still want to embark on a trial of [opioid] therapy,\" Busse said, \"and now they have the evidence to understand what their chances are of achieving meaningful improvement.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "#JUUL: How social media hyped nicotine for a new generation", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sg8EfdZOZ54/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Leading e-cigarette company Juul Labs has tried to distance itself from a vast social media presence that experts say drives its popularity among teens. But a CNN investigation sheds new light on how the company was encouraging -- and at times paying for -- social media users to promote its nicotine-filled product to thousands of their followers.\n\nOne of these users was Brooklyn-based Christina Zayas, 36, who has made a full-time career out of being a social media \"influencer\" since 2015: reviewing products, posing for photos and injecting her own brand of style and whimsy into her blog posts.\n\n\"Brands were eventually saying, 'We have a budget. Would you be interested in doing this for money?' \" Zayas told CNN.\n\nIn September 2017, she was invited to a campaign featuring Juul. The email, which she shared with CNN, came from an influencer marketing firm called Lumanu, with which she'd worked on other social media campaigns. A representative asked her to try Juul's \"premium e-cigarette and share your experience on your blog,\" saying it was an opportunity to work together \"over several months.\"\n\n\"They liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market,\" Zayas said.\n\nZayas, who had been an occasional cigarette smoker, hadn't had a good experience with e-cigarettes in the past but found the Juul easier to use, and she liked the flavors. She had tried it a week before Lumanu contacted her -- coincidentally, she said.\n\n\"When Juul reached out to me at first, I was a little hesitant because even though it's my brand, I do what I want with it,\" she added. \"Am I going to get backlash because I'm talking about smoking?\"\n\nAfter the campaign, she was paid $1,000 for one blog post and one Instagram post, she said. The Instagram post from November 2017 reached more than 4,500 people and garnered roughly 1,500 likes, according to metrics she shared with CNN.\n\nThe response was positive. \"This sounds fun,\" one user commented. \"You make smoking look so good,\" wrote another.\n\nHealth experts have slammed the company's marketing tactics as following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco, which aimed advertising at young people in an effort to gain lifelong customers. Now, in the era of social media and its heavy teen presence, those same experts worry that e-cigarettes could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs.\n\nJuul Labs spokeswoman Victoria Davis told CNN in an emailed statement that it ended its influencer program \"earlier this year.\" She added that the \"paid influencer program, which was never formalized, was short-lived\" and involved \"fewer than 10 paid influencers, who were all smokers or former smokers\" 28 and up, and who were collectively paid less than $10,000.\n\nDavis said that the influencers \"had age appropriate audiences (21+).\" Zayas, whose posts are publicly visible, shared with CNN that 5% of her current Instagram audience are 13 to 17, though the majority are 18 to 35.\n\nAn application site inviting users to \"Join the JUUL Influencers\" is no longer active, Davis said, \"and the initiative is not moving forward.\"\n\nJuul also had an \"affiliate program,\" which offered commissions for purchases made through referral links on websites and social media. Davis said that program included \"less than 20 active affiliates\" as of September 2018, the month before it ended.\n\nThe company ended that program on October 31, according to an email shared with CNN by Vapor Vanity, a website that posts reviews and information about e-cigarettes. In the email, a member of Juul's affiliate marketing team said that the program was \"on hold indefinitely until further notice\" and that the company would \"continue to evaluate the program.\"\n\nThough Davis said the influencer and affiliate programs were small, critics argue that the even small amounts of Juul-related content are able to spread widely on the internet.\n\n\"Social media works differently than other stuff. You don't need that many people,\" said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \"A small number of people who are popular and get reposted can reach a very large number of people.\"\n\nFor example, a study in May found that seven Instagram accounts posting droves of Juul-related content, only one of which belonged to the company, collectively had \"amassed over a quarter million followers.\" The other six accounts, which were later removed, were \"created by a commercial entity that would benefit from higher sales of JUUL,\" said study author Jidong Huang, associate professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\nDavis said none of the accounts in the study were part of Juul's affiliate program. And Juul worked with social media platforms to get these accounts taken down, she added.\n\nIn June, Juul said in a statement that it has \"a dedicated internal team focused on reporting inappropriate content to social media companies,\" such as third-party accounts that use the Juul name to sell products to underage users.\n\nIn addition, Davis noted that the company had phased out much of its US-based social media, shutting down its Facebook and Instagram feeds in November and scaling back its use of Twitter and YouTube.\n\nDr. Robert Jackler, founder of the Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising , told CNN it's a \"good thing\" that the company had cut down its social media in the US.\n\n\"However, it's very late in the game,\" he said.\n\nSocial butterfly effect\n\nVaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This prompted the agency last month to propose new regulations on flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise.\n\nAnother report published Monday announced similar findings: Vaping nicotine products nearly doubled among high schoolers, with more than one in five seniors saying they've done so in the past month.\n\nJuul Labs, which holds about 75% of the e-cigarette market in the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny by public health experts and the FDA, whose commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, recently warned of the \" epidemic of e-cigarette use among teenagers.\"\n\nMuch of this scrutiny has focused on the company's marketing, which has been front and center in lawsuits and other investigations into whether Juul targeted teens.\n\nPart of that marketing effort included paying influencers to post about the device.\n\nThey liked my edgy style and that I appealed to the younger market. Christina Zayas, social media influencer\n\nZayas was not the only influencer posting about Juul.\n\nCNN found personalized links tied to Zayas and other influencers that referenced Lumanu, which Davis said Juul hired for \"potential content engagement strategies.\"\n\nThese URLs -- which contain the terms \"source=lumanu\" and \"campaign=juul_influencer\" -- can be used by Lumanu to track how many people click on those links. Lumanu did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nAnother of those links came from Laura Ellner, an influencer for the past 10 years. She told CNN that her blog and social media are a \"side project,\" an opportunity to partner with brands she likes and get paid for it. She had also worked with Lumanu in the past, and the agency approached her again in September 2017, she said.\n\n\"They asked if I knew about Juul, and I literally had one in my mouth,\" said Ellner, 31, who started smoking cigarettes at 16, when her \"rebellious phase\" coincided with Camel's pi\u00f1a colada flavor, which is no longer available in the US.\n\nEllner said Lumanu sent her some talking points, directions and guidelines to follow -- \"nothing that made me feel uncomfortable,\" she offered. She felt that she had creative control over her own content, which the company approved. On her blog , Ellner praised the device as an \"intensely satisfying vapor alternative designed for adult smokers\" whose \"elegant design matches up pretty much perfectly with whatever I'm wearing.\"\n\nShe declined to tell CNN how much she was paid, but she stands by her work -- and doesn't believe that Juul targeted teenagers.\n\n\"Teenagers are going to be teenagers,\" Ellner said. \"Are we ever going to be able to stop kids from doing things they are not supposed to?\"\n\nJuul responds to a Twitter user about becoming an influencer. CNN obscured the name of the user to protect their privacy.\n\nJackler said he doesn't necessarily believe Juul intentionally targeted underaged kids in its marketing, but its appeal to kids was obvious early on, and the company didn't take early steps to prevent that.\n\n\"The company claims that they didn't know\" that the product appealed to underage kids who began using it in large numbers, Jackler said.\n\n\"I don't believe that, not for a minute, because they're also a very digital, very analytical company,\" he added. \"They know their market. They know what they're doing.\"\n\nLike, comment, share\n\nThe company engaged with social media users in other ways, commenting on posts, offering discounts on products, using popular hashtags and reposting photos of Juuls taken by other users.\n\nIn one instance this year, CNN found that Juul's Instagram reposted a photo of a Juul in an outstretched hand taken by a 17-year-old, tagging him in the description. He was not a paid influencer, but the company's official account still follows him.\n\nDavis said the company was not aware of this. \"And if we were aware, we would never have re-posted the image per our social media guidelines,\" she added. The company's social media code says, \"We only share user generated social media content that does not feature underage users.\"\n\nJackler said the company \"professed over and over that they weren't interested in targeting [underage] people, when in fact their way of promoting their product had great appeal to young people and caused a market fervor.\"\n\nAccording to one study , \"the number of JUUL-related tweets exploded in 2017 ... 17 times the 2016 levels.\" Another study this year estimated that 25% of users retweeting the company were under 18.\n\nThe bulk of this content is not sponsored, experts say. Some social media content creators told CNN they posted Juul content in an effort to gain followers through a trend or because they genuinely believed in the product.\n\nStill, Juul has deleted much of its old social media in waves -- an effort to stop underage use, it says. But many of its posts are still archived by the Stanford research group, which CNN reviewed.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"We do not feature images or situations intended for a youth audience,\" Juul's marketing and social media code says. \"We ensure responsible placement of our product designed to limit exposure to an underage demographic.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs, told CNN in June that the company has also been working to remove outside social media content created by or aimed at youth. The company has maintained that its product is intended to convert adult former smokers to what Juul describes as a less-harmful alternative.\n\n\"We were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"One of the scary things about social media is that it doesn't take a lot of money,\" said Myers, whose anti-tobacco advocacy group has documented Juul's marketing efforts. \"And if you hit the right people doing it, then it just takes off.\"\n\nJuul representatives say the company has played a minimal role in the vast amount of Juul-related content online.\n\nIn the company's November \"action plan\" against underage vaping, CEO Kevin Burns said, \"More than 99 percent of all social media content related to JUUL Labs is generated through third-party users and accounts with no affiliation to our company.\"\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" he added.\n\n\"We have done very little marketing relative to our growth,\" Matt David, the company's chief communications officer, said in a statement in July in response to an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general probing whether Juul had targeted minors.\n\nAnother Juul spokeswoman, Christine Castro, told Bloomberg in April that the company had no control over promotional content by other people and companies. \"That is completely separate from us,\" she said.\n\nCEO Burns told the New Yorker in May, \"We have frustrations about how the product is glorified on social media.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Juul and the vape debate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Juul and the vape debate 06:17\n\n'Lifestyle content'\n\nWhen Zayas was contacted by Lumanu, she said she wanted to write honestly about her personal journey with sobriety. She had been an on-and-off smoker, but when she got sober, \"not having a vice, I leaned on cigarettes again,\" she said.\n\nJuul seemed to be another option. But according to Zayas, the company didn't want her writing about her struggle with alcohol.\n\n\"They didn't want me talking about sobriety,\" Zayas said. \"They wanted me to talk about the product, the shape of the device and how cool it was.\n\n\"They just wanted me to create lifestyle content.\"\n\nShe said she doesn't regret participating in the social media campaign when she did, because it reflected a product she was using in her daily life. But when an \"influencer marketing manager\" approached her in January 2018 to be part of a video testimonial campaign, she had stopped vaping and turned down the offer, she said.\n\nThe company announced in June that it would \"no longer use models on social media platforms,\" instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul.\n\nAt least one of those ex-smokers was former Juul Influencer Ellner. She met the Juul team in San Francisco as she was moving there and ended up doing two shoots, which she said were unpaid and separate from the influencer campaign.\n\nAn image from Juul's Instagram, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\nAnother testimonial also features actress and rapper Awkwafina, identified in the title only by her first name, Nora. In a YouTube video posted in May, the performer -- who appeared this year in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Ocean's 8\" -- talked about her switch from cigarettes to Juul. The video was shared on the company's official Twitter as late as August in a now-deleted post and remains on YouTube. Representatives for Awkwafina and Juul said she did not receive financial compensation for the Juul campaign.\n\nNeither Ellner nor Awkwafina is listed on Juul's \"community\" page of former smokers' testimonials.\n\nJackler said the company's current marketing strategy is nowhere close to where it began. Before the current campaign focusing on switching former smokers, the company's marketing was \"manifestly youth-oriented,\" Jackler said.\n\nJuul promotional materials, archived by Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising.\n\n\"It showed 20-something models dressed in fashionably casual clothing,\" he added. \"They're the exact kind of young adults that teenagers find appealing and wish to aspire and be like.\"\n\nMany ads emphasized fruity flavors and sometimes oozed with sex appeal, experts say.\n\nOld job listings suggest the pursuit of social media influencers goes back those early days, as well. Around that time, PAX Labs -- the company that would later give rise to Juul Labs -- sought an \"influencer marketing intern\" who would court influencers and encourage favorable content about the product on social media.\n\nSocial media was just one part of the puzzle. Juul's launch campaign, \"Vaporized,\" threw parties and events across the country -- at least 25, according to the Stanford archive. Photos of the events show DJ booths, Juul-branded beer cozies and product display cases labeled with #vaporized and #juulvapor. Attendees at one event could step into a photo booth and create animated GIFs.\n\n\"We created ridiculous enthusiasm for the hashtag 'Vaporized,' \" marketing agency Cult Collective said in its Juul case study. The company said its campaign \"aligned perfectly with those we knew would be our best customers.\"\n\nThousands of free samples were handed out at these events, including starter kits, until the FDA forbade free samples of vaping products in 2016. After that, attendees were charged $1 to sample products at tasting events in Miami and New York. (These events were not open to those under 21, according to event ads.)\n\n\"Their business model is to get the devices in people's hands because the way they make their money is through ... selling the nicotine-rich Juul pods over and over to customers,\" Jackler said.\n\nIn June, Gould told CNN that the company took criticism of its 2015 launch campaign seriously. \"That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes,\" she said.\n\nSome advocates say Juul's marketing and social media response is too little, too late.\n\n\"Once you get kids doing it, you don't have to pay for it,\" Myers said. \"It takes off on its own, and you continue to get the financial benefit.\n\n\"It is 10 times dropping a rock in a still pond; the ripple just keeps going.\"\n\nJackler agreed, saying that the company fostered a social media phenomenon that took on a life of its own -- and continues to introduce young people to its product.\n\n\"Hashtag-Juul lives on,\" he said.\n\nBig business\n\nA few years ago, Zayas worked at an influencer agency similar to Lumanu, called Socialyte, where she managed other bloggers. She was the liaison between influencers and brands, negotiating rates and the sponsored content, she said.\n\nBrands will often reach out to influencers like her multiple times if a campaign does well, she said.\n\nAnd this can be big business, according to Kevin Popovic, director of the Idea Lab at San Diego State University and founder of Ideahaus, a creative communications agency.\n\nWhen looking for influencers to promote their products, companies scour the internet to find popular people and websites whose audiences the brand hopes to connect with, he said.\n\n\"It's a tactic that most PR agencies have used for years,\" Popovic said, \"contacting people of a certain influence in order to shape the market perception of a brand or product.\n\n\"You have to realize that the only reason people want to do business with you is because they think you have something they want,\" he said.\n\nUnlike other media such as print or television, social media offer companies detailed information on the efficacy of their campaigns. \"Many times, we'll give influencers a unique URL that has tracking abilities on it,\" Popovic said, allowing companies to better assess the return on investment.\n\nHashtag-Juul lives on. Dr. Robert Jackler, Stanford Research into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising\n\nBut critics think it's inappropriate to apply those high-tech marketing techniques to a substance like nicotine.\n\n\"They're not selling widgets,\" Myers said. \"They're selling a highly addictive product.\"\n\nSince August, the FDA has required e-cigarette manufactures to include highly visible warnings on packaging and advertising -- including on social media -- that state just that: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nMyers said Juul has followed Big Tobacco's playbook: A two-year investigation led by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids found that cigarette companies were paying influencers to post pictures that glamorized smoking. The investigation, released in August, also found that companies guided influencers on how to take photos, what hashtags to include and when to post them to increase their visibility. These campaigns reached more than 40 countries worldwide.\n\nWhen asked whether Juul was ceasing any influencer programs in other countries and about its social media channels that remain active abroad, Juul spokeswoman Davis said, \"Each country has unique rules and obligations when it comes to these types of activities, and we will assess the regulations for each country to see what might be appropriate.\"\n\n\"The notion that young people are that different ... it's inconsistent with the evidence,\" Myers said. \"The kind of imagery they were using in social media appeals to young people in country after country.\n\n\"It's exactly what we showed the cigarette companies we're doing.\"\n\nNico-teens\n\nSocial media and advertising are not the only reasons Juul has been accused of targeting kids. This year, the company abandoned efforts to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, a CNN investigation showed.\n\nThe company halted the program following a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"We stopped distribution in response to feedback from those who thought our efforts were being misunderstood,\" Davis previously told CNN, describing the effort as a \"short-lived initiative designed to provide educators with current information on vaping products in general to supplement existing tobacco prevention education.\"\n\nLast month, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb proposed to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products, which could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.\n\nThe proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors, however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he told CNN last month.\n\nTwo days before the FDA announcement, on November 13, Juul vowed to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website.\n\nThe FDA proposals come as the agency has expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies, sending letters to 21 companies in October -- including Juul -- in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy.\n\nLess than two weeks earlier, the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of documents, many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices. The FDA has not released the findings of the inspection.\n\nThe agency also plans to hold a public hearing to debate whether to approve smoking cessation drugs for kids in order to get them off of e-cigarettes. The hearing was scheduled for December 5 but was postponed due to the funeral of former President George H.W. Bush, the FDA said.\n\nWe were completely surprised by the youth usage of the product. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer at Juul Labs\n\nMyers said, \"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes.\"\n\nWhen it comes to vaping among adults, consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate: Some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, but others say there's no good evidence to support this.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGould, Juul's chief administrative officer, told CNN, \"Juul is a switching product, not a cessation product, and it is intended for adult smokers to enable them to switch from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nEllner says she's still a fan of the device and feels like Juul's uptake among kids is \"affecting a business that had other [positive] intentions.\"\n\n\"It's a bummer,\" she said.\n\nZayas, however, stopped vaping because she felt sick, and she had migraines and anxiety. She felt that she was becoming addicted to Juul pods -- each of which contains the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes , experts say.\n\n\"I was getting physically sick. Every time I put it down, I would pick it back up,\" Zayas said. \"As someone who suffers from addiction, it just wasn't a good idea for me to smoke the Juul.\n\n\"I still wake up every morning craving the Juul, but they are less and less each day.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Teen vaping continues to rise while other drug use declines, survey finds", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/SzhAf6dLfsw/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Vaping among America's teenagers continues to climb, while the use of other substances -- such as alcohol and opioids -- has declined in recent years, according to a new report.\n\nMonday's report, called Monitoring the Future , comes from the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and is based on an annual survey of drug and alcohol use and attitudes among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders in the United States. This year's survey included 44,482 students from 392 public and private schools across the country.\n\nBehind drinking alcohol, vaping was the second-most common form of substance use, the study showed, with 17.6% of eighth-graders, 32.3% of 10th-graders and 37.3% of 12th-graders reporting vaping in the past year. Last year, the annual survey found that prevalence of vaping was 13.3% among eighth-graders, 23.9% among 10th-graders and 27.8% among 12th-graders.\n\nVaping involves using an electronic cigarette , hookah or similar device to inhale certain vapors or aerosols, which could contain substances such as nicotine, marijuana or flavoring.\n\n\"What we are seeing is a change in the patterns of drug taking among teenagers in that they are the lowest that we've seen for many years,\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , which funded the report.\n\n\"So we have very good news,\" she said, \"but at the same time, we have to be vigilant, because of this very high uptake and embracing of vaping by teenagers that could lead them then to the administration of other drugs.\"\n\nVaping: 'A real problem'\n\nThis year is the second in which the Monitoring the Future survey asked high schoolers about vaping specific substances: nicotine, marijuana or \"just flavoring.\"\n\nFlavoring was the most commonly reported substance among eighth-graders at 15.1%, followed by nicotine at 10.9% and then marijuana at 4.4%.\n\nTenth-graders reported identical rates for flavoring and nicotine, but 12.4% reported vaping marijuana. Among 12th-graders, 29.7% reported vaping nicotine, 25.7% flavoring and 13.1% marijuana.\n\n\"You're seeing right now that 30% of 12th-graders last year were exposed to nicotine,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"Another issue of concern is, these devices are very efficient at delivering drugs rapidly into your brain and, in so doing, deliver the drugs in ways that make them more addictive -- and so it's not just nicotine. Now we also know that they are using it for 9THC,\" or tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid chemical in marijuana, she said.\n\n\"However, since MTF doesn't appear to separate out vaping vs. Juuling in their survey, it is hard to know what the youth are using,\" Halpern-Felsher said of the new report.\n\n\"The overall decline or stabilization of other drug use is promising, although the increase in vaping marijuana is concerning,\" she said. \"Clearly, youth drug prevention messages needs to go beyond conventional drugs and include all forms of nicotine and vaping.\"\n\nThe overall increase in vaping in the survey appears to be consistent with data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a 78% increase in youth vaping between 2017 and 2018, said Dr. Pamela Ling, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco , who works with the school's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and was not involved with the new report.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration \"has also recognized an 'epidemic' of youth vaping. The consistency of these data suggests this is a real problem,\" Ling said.\n\n\"While we see declines in cigarette smoking among youth, the increases in vaping may lead to overall rates of tobacco or nicotine use increasing. We also know from many longitudinal studies of youth that those who use e-cigarettes are about three times more likely to start smoking cigarettes ,\" she said. \"The increase in vaping goes against the trends for all other drugs and alcohol, which are declining. That's a problem.\"\n\nIn historical context, \"the absolute increases in the prevalence of nicotine vaping among 12th-graders and 10th-graders are the largest ever recorded by Monitoring the Future in the 44 years that it has continuously tracked dozens of substances,\" the authors of the report wrote in a letter to the editor Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional use of cigarettes remained at the lowest levels in the survey's history.\n\nDaily cigarette use was reported by 0.8% of eighth-graders, 1.8% of 10th-graders and 3.6% of 12th-graders in 2018, the survey showed. Lifetime cigarette use among 12th-graders went down from 26.6% in 2017 to 23.8% in 2018, and past-month use declined from 9.7% to 7.6%.\n\nIn general, substances at historic low levels of use in 2018 were alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, prescription opioids, MDMA (ecstasy or Molly), methamphetamine, amphetamines, sedatives and ketamine, according to the report.\n\nAlcohol and opioid use dropping among teens\n\nEven though alcohol and binge drinking rates appeared to be on the decline, alcohol was still \"the most frequently used substance\" in the report, Volkow said.\n\nPast-month use of alcohol was reported by 8.2%, 18.6% and 30.2% of eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, according to the survey. Yet the percentage of teenagers who reported ever using alcohol dropped as much as 58% from its peak in 1994.\n\n\"Even parents have a tolerance to alcohol, and in many instances, they maybe even provide the alcohol for parties that they are holding in their house, with the sense that, what harm is there to let teenagers drink when they are home?\" Volkow said.\n\n\"So we have a culture about drinking that is very accepted but that is slowly changing. I think changes in attitudes are in part responsible about why we're seeing the decreases.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Why are opioids so addictive? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why are opioids so addictive? 00:55\n\nThe new report also showed a significant drop over the past five years in the percentage of teenagers, particularly 12th-graders, using opioids despite the ongoing epidemic among adults in the United States\n\n\"It's fascinating that despite the fact that we have very high rates of opioids and heroin among adults, adolescents have the lowest rates that we have seen since the inception of the survey,\" Volkow said.\n\nFor instance, Vicodin use dropped by 58.4% in eighth-graders, 75.4% in 10th-graders and 67.2% in 12th-graders over the past five years, according to the report.\n\nThe survey also showed a shift in how easy teens think opioid drugs are to access.\n\nOne in three 12th-graders, or 32.5%, said in this year's report that prescription opioids were easily available, compared with more than 54.2% in 2010.\n\n\"Intriguingly, when they go off to college or go to work, you see the highest rates of opioid use among 18 to 24 years of age. So there is a big gap between the patterns of consumptions of opioids in teenagers and then when they go into young adulthood,\" Volkow said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe added that the difficulty youths face in accessing opioid drugs could explain this stark difference in use between teenagers and young adults.\n\n\"I think many of the campaigns that are trying to make it harder to get access to prescription opioids have had an effect,\" Volkow said.\n\n\"This has been decreasing the number of prescription opioids given in our country, of the number of tablets given, and as a result of that, there are less tablets in parents' cabinets, and they are actually harder to get even in the black market,\" she said.\n\n\"Also, perhaps educational campaigns about the high risk of overdoses that are associated with the use of these substances, and the high risk of addiction to these substances, all of these factors may have had a positive impact (on) teenagers.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Check your fridge and pantry for food products recalled this week", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/PuVurUELcBs/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:13", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Before the family gathers for a holiday meal, here's all the food you should purge from your pantry.

Man Utd ups and downs\n\nManchester United have sacked manager Jose Mourinho after identifying a catalogue of his failings at the club.\n\nThe Portuguese, 55, took over in May 2016 and led United to League Cup and Europa League titles, but they are 19 points behind league leaders Liverpool.\n\nThe club have made a change after no progress with results or style despite spending nearly \u00a3400m on 11 players.\n\nThey also say the new manager will understand the philosophy of the club, including their attacking tradition.\n\nIt is understood players and staff are not happy after a disappointing and unsettling period during which young players were not developed.\n\nUnited are sixth in the Premier League, but closer to the relegation zone than to leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 on Sunday.\n\nThe decision to sack Mourinho, which will cost more than \u00a318m, has been taken in the long-term interests of United with a view that the club is bigger than any one individual.\n\nMourinho is understood to have wanted his own structure, but the new manager will be appointed with a head of football above him reporting to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.\n\nA United statement said: \"A caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the season while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future.\"\n\nThe club hope to appoint a caretaker manager before they face Cardiff City on 22 December but it will not be assistant manager Michael Carrick or academy boss Nicky Butt.\n\nThe candidate will be drawn from outside the club, but will not be former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.\n\nThis tweet was posted on Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba's account before being deleted soon after\n\nA familiar conclusion to a rocky season\n\nUnited's haul of 26 points after their first 17 Premier League games is their worst tally at this stage of a season since 1990-91.\n\nThey are 11 points off the top four, which would earn a Champions League qualification place.\n\nThe sacking of Mourinho, who replaced Louis van Gaal in May 2016 and signed a contract extension in January, comes after a fall-out with \u00a389m record signing Paul Pogba, who was an unused substitute for the defeat at Anfield on Sunday.\n\nFollowing a 1-1 draw with Wolves, Pogba said he wanted United to be able to \"attack, attack, attack\" at home, which led Mourinho to say the France midfielder would no longer be the club's \"second captain\".\n\nAfter Mourinho was sacked, a post which said \"caption this\", along with a knowing expression on Pogba's face, appeared on his Twitter account before being deleted.\n\nFormer United captain Gary Neville replied: \"You do one as well!\"\n\nUnited later claimed it was a \"scheduled marketing post\" by Pogba's sponsors Adidas.\n\nMourinho's third season did not begin well after missing out on key transfer targets in the summer, and two defeats in the first three league games - to Tottenham at home and Brighton away - meant his side were playing catch-up

There is no trust between the warring sides. Both believe the other still wants a military solution.\n\nThe key to this truce largely holding will be the UN's presence on the ground and its ability to enforce the gradual pull-out of all forces and put in place a new order. That is why Martin Griffiths has called for its \"swift\" deployment.\n\nPressure from all the outside players in this war made this unexpected truce happen in a week of talks in Sweden. It is also essential if it is to hold. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, regarded as the architect of this war in Yemen, is said to be playing a key role in this shift from a military to a political push.\n\nBut the risk of an all-out assault on Hudaydah and Yemen's descent into famine still looms, if it all fails. Millions of Yemenis are hoping against hope that it holds.\n\nWhat's happening on the ground?\n\nThe ceasefire covering the city of Hudaydah and the ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ras Issa was first announced last week following talks in Sweden's capital, Stockholm. But it had to be delayed by several days because of fierce fighting.\n\nThe Houthis, who control the city and ports, and Yemen's government, whose forces are deployed to the south and east, have said they are now committed to abiding by the truce.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food\n\nThere were sporadic clashes along the front lines in Hudaydah city between 01:00 and 02:00 on Tuesday, with Yemeni officials accusing the Houthis of carrying out artillery strikes. However, residents said that by dawn the skirmishes had ended.\n\n\"The problem is that the forces have yet to disengage, and when they're close up to each other they are liable to respond to anything they see as a provocation or an alert,\" Mr Griffiths told the BBC.\n\n\"So we can expect some of this happening, but the pattern is a positive one.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Hudaydah is the main port for Yemen's shattered import-dependent economy\n\nA co-ordinator for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Susana Borges, said hospitals it supported in Hudaydah were continuing to receive patients.\n\nThe UN has warned that in a worst-case scenario, the battle for Hudaydah could cost up to 250,000 lives and cut off aid supplies to millions elsewhere.\n\nIts port is the principal lifeline for about two-thirds of Yemen's population, which is almost totally reliant on imports.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nUnder the Stockholm Agreement, once the ceasefire takes effect a \"mutual redeployment of forces\" shall be carried out from the city and ports \"to agreed-upon locations outside\".\n\nMr Griffiths said that the UN would convene, possibly on Wednesday, the first meeting of the Redeployment Co-ordination Committee, which will monitor implementation. It will include members of the warring parties and be chaired by the retired Dutch general, Patrick Cammaert.\n\nThe first phase of the redeployment will see troops withdraw from the ports and critical parts of the city associated with humanitarian facilities within two weeks and the UN taking a \"leading role\".\n\nThe full redeployment of all forces from the region should be completed within three weeks of the ceasefire entering into effect.\n\nMr Griffiths said this would include complete disengagement from the main road from Hudaydah to the capital Sanaa, which is crucial for the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the wider population.\n\nThe Stockholm Agreement should also see a prisoner swap and the facilitation of aid deliveries to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by the Houthis.\n\nAt least 6,660 civilians have been killed, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1 million people."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml", "title": "Transgender women pray at India's Sabarimala temple", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46603112", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:00:27", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright A S Satheesh Image caption The transwomen were accompanied by some 20 police officers\n\nFour transgender women have been allowed to pray at an Indian temple at the centre of a bitter row over whether women should be permitted to enter.\n\nDespite a Supreme Court ruling allowing women devotees into the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala state, they have been blocked repeatedly by mobs.\n\nThe transgender women, all wearing black sarees, were allowed to enter on Tuesday under police protection.\n\nThe temple has historically been closed to women of \"menstruating age\".\n\nThe group of transgender women had been blocked from accessing the temple on Sunday by police, citing security concerns.\n\nImage copyright A S Satheesh Image caption The four joined prayers at the temple on Tuesday\n\nBefore September's Supreme Court ruling, transgender women were allowed to enter the shrine, but since the decision - which sparked violent protests - some police officials had suggested that transgender women should dress as men in order to gain access.\n\nThey refused and took their case to a committee set up by the Kerala High Court.\n\nThe panel agreed that they could pray at the shrine, and temple officials also said they did not object to the transgender women because they do not menstruate.\n\n'We followed the rituals'\n\nThe earlier ban on women between the ages of 10 to 50 entering the Sabarimala shrine was in place partly because the temple deity, Lord Ayyappa, was a bachelor, the shrine's management had said.\n\nThe court ruling ending the ban led to security concerns as women, including activists, were met with protests from members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other allied organisations.\n\nThese organisations wanted tradition to be followed, despite the ruling of the court on 28 September based on the fundamental rights of women.\n\nImage copyright A S Satheesh Image caption Their presence was not met with protests or resistance, police said\n\nOne of the transgender women, 33-year-old Trupthi, told BBC Hindi on Tuesday that women like her were \"very much part of Hinduism\" and were respected as such.\n\n\"I am very happy that we were able to pray [to Ayyappa].

downs\n\nManchester United have sacked manager Jose Mourinho after identifying a catalogue of his failings at the club.\n\nThe Portuguese, 55, took over in May 2016 and led United to League Cup and Europa League titles, but they are 19 points behind league leaders Liverpool.\n\nThe club have made a change after no progress with results or style despite spending nearly \u00a3400m on 11 players.\n\nThey also say the new manager will understand the philosophy of the club, including their attacking tradition.\n\nIt is understood players and staff are not happy after a disappointing and unsettling period during which young players were not developed.\n\nUnited are sixth in the Premier League, but closer to the relegation zone than to leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 on Sunday.\n\nThe decision to sack Mourinho, which will cost more than \u00a318m, has been taken in the long-term interests of United with a view that the club is bigger than any one individual.\n\nMourinho is understood to have wanted his own structure, but the new manager will be appointed with a head of football above him reporting to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.\n\nA United statement said: \"A caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the season while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future.\"\n\nThe club hope to appoint a caretaker manager before they face Cardiff City on 22 December but it will not be assistant manager Michael Carrick or academy boss Nicky Butt.\n\nThe candidate will be drawn from outside the club, but will not be former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.\n\nThis tweet was posted on Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba's account before being deleted soon after\n\nA familiar conclusion to a rocky season\n\nUnited's haul of 26 points after their first 17 Premier League games is their worst tally at this stage of a season since 1990-91.\n\nThey are 11 points off the top four, which would earn a Champions League qualification place.\n\nThe sacking of Mourinho, who replaced Louis van Gaal in May 2016 and signed a contract extension in January, comes after a fall-out with \u00a389m record signing Paul Pogba, who was an unused substitute for the defeat at Anfield on Sunday.\n\nFollowing a 1-1 draw with Wolves, Pogba said he wanted United to be able to \"attack, attack, attack\" at home, which led Mourinho to say the France midfielder would no longer be the club's \"second captain\".\n\nAfter Mourinho was sacked, a post which said \"caption this\", along with a knowing expression on Pogba's face, appeared on his Twitter account before being deleted.\n\nFormer United captain Gary Neville replied: \"You do one as well!\"\n\nUnited later claimed it was a \"scheduled marketing post\" by Pogba's sponsors Adidas.\n\nMourinho's third season did not begin well after missing out on key transfer targets in the summer, and two defeats in the first three league games - to Tottenham at home and Brighton away - meant his side were playing catch-up with the leading teams.\n\nBy October, there were reports Mourinho might be sacked prior to the home game against Newcastle, but after the team trailed 2-0, they turned it around to win 3-2 and seemingly buy the former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss more time.\n\nMourinho's agent Jorge Mendes attempted to calm matters earlier this month by taking the step of issuing a statement to say his client was \"very happy\" and \"fully committed\" to the club.\n\nDespite reaching the Champions League last 16, where United will play Paris St-Germain, they have won just one of their past six games in the Premier League.\n\nMourinho's dismissal continues his run of having never completed four consecutive seasons in charge of a club.\n\nOnly once has he made it into a fourth campaign,

But nothing of the sort has been detected and so a wider, safer pass will not be needed.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JH-APL/SWRI Image caption After taking hundreds of images of Ultima Thule (yellow dot), mission planners are confident there is little debris close to the object and it is safe to stay on the inner path (3,500km flyby distance) as opposed to the outer trajectory (10,000km)\n\nIt is now three years since New Horizons made its remarkable flyby of dwarf planet Pluto. That was a technical tour de force and acquiring observations at Ultima will be just as tricky.\n\nControllers will have to tell the spacecraft precisely where and when to point its instruments or risk sensing empty space as it hurtles by at 51,000km/h.\n\n\"Can we fly 3,500km from the object and get all those images centred right on to the target, and not miss anything? That's the excitement for me; that's the challenge,\" said Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman at last week's American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington DC.\n\nNew Horizons will be sending back repeat images of Ultima in the coming days that will help refine the final navigation and timing models used during the flyby.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: It is now over three years since New Horizons sped past Pluto\n\nWhat do we know about Ultima Thule?\n\nVery little. The object was only discovered four years ago by the Hubble telescope in a search for potential targets that New Horizons could reach after its Pluto encounter.\n\nInitially catalogued as (486958) 2015 MU69, it was given the more catchy nickname of Ultima Thule (Pronounced: Tool-ee) after a public consultation exercise.\n\nLike many Kuiper belt objects of its type, it is likely to be composed of dust and ices that came together at the dawn of the Solar System more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nTheory suggests such bodies will take on an elongated or lobular form. Think potato or peanut.\n\nIts surface should be very dark, having being \"burnt\" through the eons by high-energy radiation - cosmic rays and X-rays.\n\nNew Horizons will study Ultima's shape, composition and environment.\n\nScientists hope Ultima can provide insights on how these distant objects formed. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a great many pebble-sized grains.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Pluto is the size of an Earth continent; Ultima would be a mountain on Pluto\n\nWhat can we expect from the flyby?\n\nDon't blink, you might miss it. Unlike the encounter with Pluto in July 2015, there won't be increasingly resolved images on approach to admire. Ultima will remain a blob in the viewfinder pretty much until the day of flyby, which has 05:33 GMT set as the time of closest approach.\n\nHowever, the much reduced separation between the probe and Ultima (3,500km versus 12,500km at the dwarf planet) means that finer detail in the surface will eventually be observed.\n\nThe \"mouthwatering\" phase of the pass occurs in a roughly 48-hour period, centred mostly on the day-side of the object. Because New Horizons has to swivel to point its instruments, it cannot keep its antenna locked on Earth while also gathering data.\n\nControllers must therefore wait until later on New Year's Day for the probe to \"phone home\" a status update and to start to downlink some choice pictures.\n\nAnd it will be 2 January before we see the first of these images, and 3 January before we get the best.\n\nAt a distance of 6.5 billion km, radio signals take over six hours to reach Earth.\n\n\"Our data rates are low - typical data rates max out around 1,000 bits a second and it's going to take 20 months to get it all back,\" explained New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"Which is kinda cool because we'll be getting new presents from the Kuiper belt every week and every month though 2019 and most of 2020,\" he told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL Image caption The Voyager probes are now both outside the heliosphere\n\nWhat does New Horizons do afterwards?\n\nThe team working on the probe is going ask Nasa to fund an extended mission.\n\nThe hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.\n\nIt has just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it has sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments through this period, too.\n\nNew Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to keep talking to Earth as it leaves the Solar System.\n\nThe two 1970s Voyager missions have both now exited the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun. Voyager 2 has only recently done it, in November.\n\nThis occurred at a distance of 119 Astronomical Units (or 119 times the Earth-Sun distance, 149 million km).

wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay

interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a

cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:22", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments.\n\nThe amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices.\n\nPeople who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added.\n\nPolice said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks.

There was no Collusion!\"\n\nFlynn served as Trump's national security adviser at the outset of his administration, but was fired after less than a month on the job.Evidence surfaced that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contacts with Kislyak in the period between Trump's election in November 2016 and becoming president on January 20, 2017.\n\nFlynn was a fixture at Trump's political rallies during the 2016 campaign, often mocking the Democratic challenger, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.At the Republican national convention that formally nominated Trump as the party's 2016 candidate, Flynn led thousands of Trump supporters in chanting against Clinton, \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\" for her usage of a private email server during her tenure as the country's top diplomat.\n\nFlynn met 19 times with Mueller's investigators since pleading guilty a year ago, talks that drew the interest of Trump just ahead of the sentencing as to what he might reveal about the inner workings of the 2016 campaign.Prosecutors told Sullivan it was possible Flynn would continue to cooperate with investigators.\n\nFlynn had drawn investigators' scrutiny before he ran afoul of the FBI investigation in January 2017.While serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, he lobbied for a Dutch company linked to the Turkish government without registering as a foreign agent.\n\nOn Monday, the United States charged two of Flynn's former business associates with illegally carrying out a Turkish lobbying campaign.The government said the scheme was an effort to push American officials to expel a Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, alleged by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to have orchestrated the failed 2016 coup against Erdogan's government.\n\nFlynn began cooperating with the special counsel after pleading guilty to lying to federal agents about his conversations with Kislyak.He became the first of five former Trump associates who have entered guilty pleas with the special counsel's office.\n\nTrump has for months derided Mueller's probe, tweeting several more broadsides against it after wishing Flynn well.\n\n"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zuriqiepuiqm", "title": "Russia Rejects Reports Alleging Extensive US Election Meddling", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-election-trump/4705334.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:36", "body_paragraphs": "The size and scope of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was far more extensive and thorough than previously understood, according to two newly released reports.\n\nThe reports that emerged this week support conclusions by the U.S. intelligence community \u2014 and published in an unclassified January 2017 report \u2014 that the goal of all of Russia\u2019s meddling in the months leading up to the 2016 elections was to get their preferred candidate elected president of the United States.\n\n\"What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party and specifically Donald Trump,\" according to the report by Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis firm Graphika.\n\nRussia on Tuesday rejected the allegations in the two reports. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the accusations baseless.\n\nThe findings, as first reported by The Washington Post, said Russians working for a group called the Internet Research Agency (IRA) began experimenting with social media to influence local elections in 2009 and expanded its operations to U.S. elections in 2013 using Twitter.\n\n\u200bIt gradually added other popular social media sites to its campaign, including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, using race and social issues such as gun rights, immigration and police brutality, to sow division and discontent.\n\n\"Conservative and right-wing voters were actively encouraged to get behind Trump\u2019s campaign,\" according to the report by Oxford and Graphika. \"Other voters were encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election in general.\"\n\nRussia's IRA activity also sought out African-American voters in particular with advertising on Facebook and Instagram and with video content on YouTube.\n\n\"Most of the interest-based targeting focused on African-American communities and interests,\" the second report by the cybersecurity firm New Knowledge showed.\n\n\"Messaging to African-Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African-Americans, including police violence, poverty and disproportionate levels of incarceration,\" the Oxford University-Graphika report added. \"These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African-American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead.\"\n\nOther groups such as liberals, women, Muslims, Latinos and veterans were also targeted with similar messages either appealing to their politics or trying to discourage them from voting.\n\nThis newly released data demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, said in a statement Monday. \"Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped.\"\n\n\"This should stand as a wake-up call,\" added Senate Intelligence Committee vice chair, Democrat Mark Warner, who has been critical of social media companies and the way they have handled Russia\u2019s online influence campaigns.\n\n\"It is time to get serious in addressing this challenge,\" Warner said. \"That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media.\"\n\nThe Oxford-Graphika report said it is clear the response by social media companies has been lacking.\n\n\"We clearly observe a belated and uncoordinated response from the platforms that provided the data,\" the report said. \"In some cases, activity on one platform was detected and suspended months before similar action was taken against related activity on another platform.\"\n\nIn a statement Monday, Facebook said it continues to \"fully cooperate with officials investigating the IRA's activity on Facebook and Instagram around the 2016 election.\"\n\n\"We've made progress in helping prevent interference on our platforms during elections, strengthened our policies against voter suppression ahead of the 2018 midterms, and funded independent research on the impact of social media on democracy,\" the statement said, adding the company believes Congress and intelligence officials \"are best placed to use the information we and others provide.\"\n\n\"Our singular focus is to improve the health of the public conversation on our platform,\" Twitter said in a statement of its own. \"We've made significant strides since 2016 to counter manipulation of our service, including our release of additional data in October related to previously disclosed activities to enable further independent academic research and investigation.\"\n\nGoogle reactions\n\nThe reports, though, indicate the measures that have been taken may not be enough, as Russia and others continue to make use of social media platforms.\n\nThe Oxford-Graphika report said Russia\u2019s use of social media did not peak until after the election, with the IRA buying the most ad volume on Facebook in April 2017, shortly after the U.S. airstrikes against chemical weapon sites in Syria.\n\nAnd U.S. intelligence and military officials have told VOA that Russia continued to target segments of U.S. society, including ongoing efforts to influence U.S. military personnel and their families in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThe United States has already leveled criminal charges against IRA for interfering in the 2016 campaign.\n\nCurrent and former intelligence officials also warn that it would be a mistake to focus only on Russia\u2019s use of social media, pointing to last week\u2019s guilty plea by Russian spy Maria Butina, who admitted to using the National Rifle Association to get close to key conservative politicians.\n\n\"It illustrates \u2026 the astute understanding the Russians have of our political ecosystem,\" James Clapper, former director of National Intelligence, told VOA.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election and whether the president has tried to obstruct justice by trying to undermine the probe.\n\nTrump denies there was any collusion and calls

The nation\u2019s suicide rate is where West Virginia\u2019s was nearly 20 years ago.\n\nObesity was common in West Virginia before it became widespread in the rest of the country. And life expectancy started tumbling in the Mountain State before it began falling across the U.S.\n\nMaggie Hill has lived in the state for all of her 67 years. Sitting in her cabin in the town of Madison recently, she ticked off the many deaths that have befallen her family: An older brother drowned in a flood in 1977. A sister died in a house fire. Two siblings, both smokers, died of lung cancer. Two others were stillborn. Her first husband died of congestive heart failure.\n\nThen there were the suicides. Two of her three sons shot themselves to death, one of them after losing his job. Her second husband died the same way, using a gun in their bedroom closet one Sunday morning while she was still in bed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people have a lot to live for,\u201d she said. \u201cI really and truly don\u2019t see things getting better.\u201d\n\nLife expectancy\n\nAfter decades of steady increases, U.S. life expectancy has been declining since 2014. A government report released last month said the trend continued last year, driven in part by suicides and drug overdoses \u2014 the so-called diseases of despair.\n\nWhat else is driving the decline? Experts say America\u2019s obesity problem has worsened the diabetes death rate and helped stall progress against the nation\u2019s leading killer, heart disease.West Virginia eclipses most other states in the percentage of people affected by diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It has had the nation\u2019s highest rate of drug overdose deaths for years running. It also has the highest obesity rate and the highest rates of diabetes and high blood pressure. Adding to those woes is the highest suicide rate among states east of the Mississippi River.\n\nEarlier this fall, U.S. health officials released for the first time life expectancy predictions at a neighborhood level. An Associated Press analysis of the data found wide disparities in cities and towns. Among states, the AP found, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy. West Virginia was the second lowest, behind Mississippi.\n\nMississippi, Oklahoma and a few other states suffer death and disease rates that are about as bad \u2014 or sometimes worse. But those places have unusually large populations of low-income black or Native American people, who suffer a disproportionate share of disability, disease and death.\n\nWest Virginia is 94 percent white. That makes it a telling indicator. Nearly 80 percent of the Americans who die each year are white people, and death rates rose in white men and women last year but were flat or falling in blacks and Hispanics.\n\nSo white deaths \u2014 particularly those of people who are not elderly \u2014 are mainly responsible for the nation\u2019s declining life expectancy.\n\nWidespread attention\n\nTen years ago, The Associated Press described Huntington, West Virginia, and its environs as the unhealthiest place in America , based on health survey data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that put it at the bottom of the charts in more than a half-dozen measures, including the highest proportions of people who were obese, had diabetes and had heart disease.\n\nThe AP report, and others like it, drew widespread attention that peaked in 2010, when celebrity chef Jamie Oliver staged a reality TV show in Huntington to teach people how to eat better.\n\nThe attention was not entirely welcomed. It felt like outsiders coming in to criticize and perpetuate \u201chillbilly\u201d stereotypes, said Steve Williams, who was elected Huntington\u2019s mayor in 2012.\n\nBut Williams said it also was motivating, prompting changes in school food and even improvements to parks and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cWe get slammed all the time with obesity,\u201d said Andy Fischer, a financial adviser who organized a 2,500-person community walking program. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better.\u201d\n\nThese days, the Huntington area looks somewhat better in government health surveys. For example, the region\u2019s obesity rate is only a few percentage points above the national median \u2014 instead of 10 or 20 points.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s clear the Huntington area still has some big problems. It ranks among the worst metro areas in measures like the percentage of adults who smoke, have high blood pressure and have had a stroke.\n\nOpioids and obesity\n\nAbout the time Huntington was trying to tackle its weight problem, it was rocked by a new crisis \u2014 opioid addiction.\n\nA recently-closed crisis and detox center in downtown Logan, W.Va. (AP Photo/Tyler Evert)\n\nWest Virginia now has the distinction of having the nation\u2019s highest drug overdose death rate. Last year, for the first time, the state\u2019s body count surpassed 1,000. The epidemic also produced ripple effects such as a spike in the number of children taken into foster care because of dead or addicted parents.\n\nIn the last two years, no West Virginia county has seen more overdose deaths than Cabell County, which includes Huntington.\n\nOne of the grimmest spots has been Huntington\u2019s West End \u2014 some locals call it \u201cthe Worst End.\u201d The AP analysis of neighborhood-level death data found the area had a life expectancy at birth of only 62 years, 16 years shorter than national life expectancy.\n\nHuntington\u2019s reputation crystalized on a chaotic Monday in August 2016, when emergency responders saw 28 overdoses over six hours \u2014 including two deaths.\n\nThe city soon became known as America\u2019s overdose capital. As documentary crews descended, Huntington tried to confront the problem. Among the efforts were quick-response teams charged with finding people days after they were treated for an overdose. The teams include a police officer, a clergy member, a paramedic and a treatment counselor who hand out overdose-reversing naloxone and provide information about treatment. They also direct people to a needle-exchange program run by the Cabell-Huntington Health Department.\n\nThommy Hill stands outside the Cabell County/Huntington Health Department, where he works in the harm reduction program, in Huntington, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018.

He knows every drug user who visits and constantly tries to persuade them to try treatment \u2014 arranging immediate transportation and handing them a backpack full of clothes if they agree.\n\nOne morning in late October, bantering with a man who had come in for fresh needles, Hill lit up when the visitor mentioned a past vacation. Hill pitched him a one-week stay at a treatment hospital, joking that \u201cpeople will wait on you hand and foot.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, he explained: \u201cIt\u2019s all about treating them like people. They don\u2019t get a lot of that.\u201d\n\nSomething seems to be working. Non-fatal overdoses in Huntington have fallen and are on track to be 40 percent lower than 2017, city officials said. They are optimistic deaths will be down this year, too.\n\n\u201cIf we can turn around overdose numbers here, we can do it anywhere,\u201d Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in May at a health summit in Huntington.\n\nPoliticians including President Donald Trump have decried the opioid epidemic, prioritizing it over other health crises. But obesity still presents a towering threat.\n\nWest Virginians exercise less than other Americans. They eat fruits and vegetables less often. Only Mississippi has a larger proportion of adults drinking soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages each day.\n\nIn some cases, state policies are not helping.\n\nFor example, bariatric surgery can help certain obese people for whom conventional diet and exercise programs have no lasting effect. But West Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program has unusually harsh cost-control barriers that make it difficult for severely obese people to get approved for surgery, according to a recent analysis by George Washington University.\n\nThen there\u2019s the soda tax, which health advocates say can give consumers second thoughts about choosing those drinks. Last year, Gov. Jim Justice proposed raising it from 1 cent per 16.9-ounce bottle to a penny per ounce. It failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nSigns of change\n\nThere are some signs of hope in West Virginia. In October, health advocates held a conference on obesity in the South in West Virginia\u2019s capital city. It was a surprisingly upbeat meeting.\n\nThe South has long had the highest obesity rates in the country, and nowhere has adult obesity been more common than in West Virginia. But future-focused projects are popping up all over the state, aimed at getting kids to embrace exercise and healthy eating.\n\n\u201cWe want to give people hope that we can be knocked off the unhealthiest list\u201d of states, said Kayla Wright, director of an organization called Try This West Virginia that\u2019s funding many of them.\n\nOne grant paid for high school students to build a 5K trail and explore creating a teen cross-country running group. Another grant went toward restoring a greenhouse and helping people learn to garden.\n\nMany of the projects are baby steps, but conference participants cited a few places where progress seems broader. Huntington is one, they say.\n\nAnother is Mingo County, in the southwest corner of the state, deep in the heart of coal country. Life expectancy there has never been high. Jobs in the lumber and coal industries were notoriously dangerous. Doctors could be hard to find. And there was violence: The deadly Hatfield-McCoy feud played out in those hills, as did bloody labor battles between miners and coal companies.\n\nThe largest municipality in the county, Williamson, became known in the last decade as a center for the abuse of prescription opioid painkillers. (Some called the 3,000-person town \u201cPilliamson.\u201d)\n\nBut while the drug crisis was playing out, some local leaders \u2014 led by a young doctor named C. Donovan \u201cDino\u201d Beckett \u2014 built a series of programs aimed at creating a culture of health. It started seven years ago with the opening of a free clinic that later became the Williams Health and Wellness Center. That spawned a community garden and a vegetable delivery service, a running club and once-a-month 5K races that draw a few hundred runners. Also in the works, for next year, is a federally funded treatment program for people addicted to drugs.\n\nSo far, perhaps the most successful program is one that sends health workers to the homes of diabetics.\n\nJamie Muncy is one success story.\n\nThe 48-year-old lost his job three years ago when the mine he was working in shut down. Last fall, he had just pulled out of a long-term habit of pain pills and other drugs when he bizarrely tore a tendon in his foot while picking up a piece of paper at a post office.\n\nIt was so painful he rarely walked, but he continued to eat terribly. Out of a job and with his marriage in ruins, \u201cI had no motivation\u201d to be healthy, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nBy January, the 5-foot-3 former mine foreman ballooned from 165 pounds to 196. \u201cI was round as I was tall,\u201d he said.\n\nA visit to the Williamson health center revealed he had alarming, diabetes-qualifying blood sugar levels. He\u2019d had mini-strokes in the past, and his physician said a much bigger one was probably on its way if Muncy did not take drastic steps.\n\nThe doctor put him on a tight carb-cutting diet, connected him to physical therapy and put him in the home-visit diabetes program.\n\nNow Muncy walks 5 miles a day and is a regular at the farmer\u2019s market. His weight is down to about 145 pounds, he said in a recent interview. He still smokes, though.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nUniversity of Washington researchers recently calculated something called \u201chealthy life expectancy\u201d \u2014 the period someone born today could expect to live in relative health. West Virginia, at 62\u00bd years, was the lowest among states.\n\nClearly, health problems abound.\n\nBlack lung disease rates and coal mine injury rates appear to be up.\n\nWest Virginia has been at the top of the charts in hepatitis B and C infection rates. Adding to that, the state saw an HIV outbreak last year, and it is still weathering a hepatitis A outbreak \u2014 both associated with injection drug users\n\nMaggie Hill, the lifelong West Virginian, has little hope for the future. But she does have Charity.\n\nCharity is a 10-year-old girl Hill adopted about five years ago. Hill\u2019s son had been raising her but lost custody during his ongoing struggle with drug addiction, Hill said.\n\nHill and Charity live in a small wooded valley with a creek in it \u2014 a holler, as they say in West Virginia. Her house is a cabin that from the outside resembles a small, tidy barn. Charity has given her life a purpose, she said.\n\n\u201cI taught her how to survive when I\u2019m gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to. She\u2019s going to need to know how to cook. ... She needs to know how to keep house. She needs to know how to mow grass, so if she ain\u2019t got a man, she can keep the yard clean. I teach her every bit of this.\u201d\n\nCharity is a good student (\u201cFour A\u2019s and a B on her last report card,\u201d Hill said). And there\u2019s hope that she will do well enough to go to college. Hill is saving for it. \u201cShe wants to be a doctor,\u201d Hill said.\n\nIf Charity does go to college, some place away from Boone County, Hill says she will move there with her. \u201cIf I\u2019m alive,\u201d she said."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "US Surgeon General Warns of Teen Risks From e-Cigarettes", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-surgeon-general-warns-of-teen-risks-from-e-cigarettes/4705458.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "The government\u2019s top doctor is taking aim at the best-selling electronic cigarette brand in the U.S., urging swift action to prevent Juul and similar vaping brands from addicting millions of teenagers.\n\nIn an advisory Tuesday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said parents, teachers, health professionals and government officials must take \u201caggressive steps\u201d to keep children from using e-cigarettes. Federal law bars the sale of e-cigarettes to those under 18.\n\nFor young people, \u201cnicotine is dangerous and it can have negative health effects,\u201d Adams said in an interview. \u201cIt can impact learning, attention and memory, and it can prime the youth brain for addiction.\u201d\n\nFederal officials are scrambling to reverse a recent explosion in teen vaping that public health officials fear could undermine decades of declines in tobacco use. An estimated 3.6 million U.S. teens are now using e-cigarettes, representing 1 in 5 high school students and 1 in 20 middle schoolers, according to the latest federal figures.\n\nSeparate survey results released Monday showed twice as many high school students used e-cigarettes this year compared to last year.\n\nE-cigarettes and other vaping devices have been sold in the U.S. since 2007, growing into a $6.6 billion business. Most devices heat a flavored nicotine solution into an inhalable vapor. They have been pitched to adult smokers as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes, though there\u2019s been little research on the long-term health effects or on whether they help people quit. Even more worrisome, a growing body of research suggests that teens who vape are more likely to try regular cigarettes.\n\nAdams singled out Silicon Valley startup Juul. The company leapfrogged over its larger competitors with online promotions portraying their small device as the latest high-tech gadget for hip, attractive young people. Analysts now estimate the company controls more than 75 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market.\n\nThe surgeon general\u2019s advisory notes that each Juul cartridge, or pod, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Additionally, Adams states that Juul\u2019s liquid nicotine mixture is specially formulated to give a smoother, more potent nicotine buzz. That effect poses special risks for young people, Adams says.\n\n\u201cWe do know that these newer products, such as Juul, can promote dependence in just a few uses,\u201d Adams said.\n\nJuul said in a statement that it shares the surgeon general\u2019s goal: \u201cWe are committed to preventing youth access of Juul products.\u201d\n\nLast month, San Francisco-based Juul shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and halted in-store sales of its flavored pods. The flavors remain available via age-restricted online sales. That voluntary action came days before the Food and Drug Administration proposed industrywide restrictions on online and convenience store sales of e-cigarettes to deter use by kids.\n\nAdams recommends parents, teachers and health professionals learn about e-cigarettes, talk to children about the risks and set an example by not using tobacco products."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Vietnam Natural Gas Plans Clash with Climate Fears", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-natural-gas-plans-clash-with-climate-fears/4705382.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "Vietnam repeatedly calls itself one of the countries that would be most devastated if climate change worsens, but it is also preparing to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), which emits the greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change.\n\nRather than drastically boost renewable energy, Vietnam plans to start using LNG for the first time in 2020, a decision that highlights how hard it is for countries to balance energy costs with environmental protection.\n\nWhile emissions resulting from LNG extraction, production and use are low compared to other fossil fuels, its increasing usage means it will be the biggest source of carbon emission growth by 2025 according to the energy consultancy Woods Mackenzie.\n\nLe Van Luc at the Ministry of Industry and Trade explains that, as the economy grows quickly, domestic energy supplies can not keep up with the need for more electricity.\n\n\u201cYou could see that for Vietnam, our country used to produce and export energy for many years,\u201d said Luc, deputy director of electricity and renewable energy at the ministry. \u201cHowever, in 2015, we became a net energy importer, especially of coal and natural gas.\u201d\n\nThe communist country of 100 million people is not alone.\n\nOther United Nations members gathering for climate talks in Poland this week face similar challenges, from the yellow vest protesters in France angered by fuel price hikes, to the U.S. officials trying to convince U.N. colleagues in side events that coal can be clean.\n\nElsewhere in Southeast Asia, as well, peers like Indonesia and Thailand intend to burn ever more coal, despite also fearing the threat of climate change.\n\nFor Vietnam, LNG is making its debut in part because policymakers believe there are limits to renewable energy. Luc said that the country is reaching the upper limit of the hydro power it can get from dams, and that natural gas is a bit more affordable than wind or solar power.\n\nLNG is also being discussed because the United States wants to promote it here, which would allow American companies to export more of the fossil fuel. The U.S. government organized a natural gas conference last week, when Mary Tarnowka, the U.S. consul general in Ho Chi Minh City, warned of energy shortages to come in southern Vietnam. She noted the city she currently calls home has annual economic growth of 10 percent.\n\n\u201cAll of this is creating a growing middle class, and a society and culture that is growing as quickly as their energy demands,\u201d she said in a speech. \u201cWith the rising demand for energy approaching a growth rate of 8 percent in 2018, Vietnam is currently facing significant challenges in the southern provinces in order to keep pace.\u201d\n\nNatural gas is typically transported through pipelines, but for longer distances, it must be cooled down to a liquid state, so that it can be shipped in containers. That would allow it to travel from the United States, across the Pacific to Vietnam.\n\nOnce it arrives, though, there has to be infrastructure to receive the LNG and warm it back into a gaseous state that can be used for fuel. That is where U.S. companies and agencies are coming in to advise on construction.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty and challenge for Vietnam is that we have yet to have any experience in constructing or operating LNG infrastructure,\u201d Luc said.\n\nHe added that the country is still investing in electricity generated from the wind and the sun. But fossil fuels are needed as a buffer, Luc said, for when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining.\n\nSome investors say Vietnam pays too low a tariff to make renewables viable, but others are already making a profit from solar power and say firms need to accept the price rather than hope for it to change.\n\nEnvironmental economist Le Viet Phu said Vietnam needs a diverse energy mix. The country is not going to abandon coal, but using more natural gas will be less polluting than coal, and alternative energy is on the rise, he said.\n\n\u201cRenewables are good for shedding peak loads, but renewables are not cheap,\u201d said Phu, of Fulbright University Vietnam. \u201cWe have seen renewables picking up speed recently, but it will be years until we see some significant impact on the system.\u201d\n\nAnd activists are not giving up on alternative energy, including biomass, which refers to plants that can be burned as fuel.\n\n\u201cHo Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta are the areas with the largest potential in the country for renewable energy development projects,\u201d environmental group CHANGE wrote on its blog, \u201cespecially solar and biomass, with many hours of sunshine, a long sunny season, and abundant agricultural by-products, such as straw, rice bran, and rice husks.\u201d"}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Wondrous Extinct Flying Reptiles Boasted Rudimentary Feathers", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/wondrous-extinct-flying-reptiles-boasted-rudimentary-feathers/4705209.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "A microscopic examination of fossils from China has revealed that the fur-like body covering of pterosaurs, the remarkable flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs, was actually made up of rudimentary feathers.\n\nThe surprising discovery described by scientists on Monday means that dinosaurs and their bird descendants were not the only creatures to boast feathers and that feathers likely appeared much longer ago than previously known. Pterosaurs were only distantly related to dinosaurs and birds.\n\nBirds need feathers to fly. That was not the case with pterosaurs. Short, hair-like feathers covered their bodies and wings but lacked the strong central shaft of avian flight feathers, the researchers said. They may have provided insulation and other benefits, as hair does for mammals.\n\n\"They were not flight feathers,\" said paleontologist Baoyu Jiang of Nanjing University, who led the research published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. \"They looked fuzzy, and they didn't have complicated feathers.\"\n\nThe researchers examined beautifully preserved Jurassic Period fossils roughly 160 to 165 million years old of two small pterosaurs called anurognathids from northeastern China.\n\nApparently forest dwellers and insect eaters, they possessed 18-inch (45 cm) wingspans, short tails and superficially frog-like faces.\n\nPterosaurs were the first vertebrates to master flight, followed much later by birds and bats. Scientists have known since the 19th century that pterosaurs had a fur-like body covering and there has been a long-running scientific debate about how to classify it.\n\nMany of the filaments, under the microscope, showed branching like in feathers but not hair.\n\nUniversity of Bristol paleontologist and study co-author Mike Benton said four types of pterosaur feathers were observed: downy feathers; single filaments; bundles of filaments; and filaments with tufts at the end. Tiny pigment-related structures indicated these feathers were ginger-brown in color.\n\nBirds, many meat-eating dinosaurs and some plant-eating dinosaurs are known to have had feathers, though these looked different from those seen on the pterosaurs.\n\n\"We feel the simplest thing for the present is to call them all feathers because they show branching, the fundamental distinguishing character of a feather,\" Benton said.\n\nPterosaurs and dinosaurs both appeared roughly 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period. The researchers said the appearance of feathers in both groups suggests feathers first evolved perhaps 250 million years ago in a common ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs.\n\nPterosaurs, the biggest of which had 35-foot (10.7-meter)wingspans, went extinct along with the dinosaurs after an asteroid impact 66 million years ago."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Grocery Store Using Unmanned Vehicles for Delivery", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/grocery-store-using-unmanned-vehicles-for-delivery-/4705394.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "U.S. supermarket chain Kroger Co said on Tuesday it has started using unmanned autonomous vehicles to deliver groceries Scottsdale, Arizona in partnership with Silicon Valley startup Nuro.\n\nThe delivery service follows a pilot program started by the companies in Scottsdale in August and involved Nuro's R1, a custom unmanned vehicle.\n\nThe R1 uses public roads and has no driver and is used to only transport goods.\n\nKroger's deal with Nuro underscores the stiff competition in the U.S. grocery delivery market with supermarket chains angling for a bigger share of consumer spending.\n\nPeers Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc have also invested heavily in their delivery operations by expanding their offerings and shortening delivery times.\n\nWalmart, Ford Motor Co and delivery service Postmates Inc said last month they would collaborate to deliver groceries and other goods to Walmart customers and that could someday use autonomous vehicles.\n\nKroger said the service would be available in Scottsdale at its unit Fry's Food Stores for $5.95 with no minimum order requirement for same-day or next-day deliveries."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "With Tensions Rising Between US and China, Silicon Valley Rethinks its Bonds", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/4705269.html", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:41", "body_paragraphs": "The URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nAmerican tech companies have long looked to China as a key partner to help build and sell cutting-edge devices and services.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory at the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nChinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into \u201ca modern civilized\u201d world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.\n\nThe Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making \u201cmany untrue reports\u201d about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.\n\n\u201cThose reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,\u201d the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.\n\nHowever, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.\n\nPayment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said \u2014 barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees \u2014 or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there \u2014 are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center at the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nA former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.\n\n\u201cThe camp didn\u2019t pay any money, not a single cent,\u201d he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. \u201cEven for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.\u201d\n\nRushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\n\u201cAmerican companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 9, 2018, photo, Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp, holds up a phone showing a state television report about what Beijing calls \"vocational training centers\" for a photo in a restaurant in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Koksebek says that shortly before he was released from the camp in April, the camp's director strode into his class and told them they would soon be opening a new factory, and that detainees would be required to work and taught how to cook, sew, and repair cars.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.\n\nAbout two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.\n\nMen and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 6, 2018, photo, Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, the wife of a sheep herder, holds up a picture of her daughter, Rezila Nulale, and her graduation certificate, at an office of an advocacy group for ethnic Kazakhs born in China in Almaty, Kazakhstan on December 6, 2018. Kaliaskar says her daughter, a college graduate who had a job in advertising, was detained in an internment camp in China's far western region of Xinjiang and is now being forced to make clothes for no pay.\n\nAs China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a \u201cvocational skills education and training center\u201d in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.\n\n\u201cTerrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,\u201d the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this \u201cglobal issue.\u201d\n\nWu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be \u201cunproblematic,\u201d he said, adding that the center is government-operated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making our contribution to eradicating poverty,\u201d Wu told the AP over the phone.\n\nThe 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.\n\nTrainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn\u2019t come here,\u201d one Uighur student said. \u201cThe party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.\u201d\n\nThe segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida\u2019s main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a child stands near a large screen showing photos of Chinese President Xi Jinping near a carpark in Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nPolice told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a \u201cmilitary facility.\u201d Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an \u201capparel employment training base.\u201d\n\nPosters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as \u201cLearn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person\u201d and \u201cNo need to pay tuition, find a job easily.\u201d\n\nNathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida\u2019s case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.\n\n\u201cThere are watchtowers throughout,\u201d Ruser said. \u201cThere are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.\u201d\n\nThe AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.\n\nAt least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.\n\nSprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp\u2019s sewing factory floor.\n\nShawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear\u2019s marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she\u2019s surprised the workers are \u201cfriendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Monday, Dec. 3, 2018, photo, a guard tower and barbed wire fences are seen around a facility in the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux in western China's Xinjiang region. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region.\n\nBadger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island\u2019s Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it\u2019s impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.\n\nAll the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.\n\nBadger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.\n\n\u201cWe will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,\u201d he said.\n\nBadger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.\n\nIn recent years, Badger imported sportswear \u2014 jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more \u2014 from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.\n\nThe U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention \u201ctraining\u201d there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.\n\n\u201cNot only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,\u201d said Smith. \u201cU.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rushan Abbas, 51, of Herndon, Va., holds a photo of her sister, Gulshan Abbas, Monday, Dec. 17, 2018, in Washington. Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among the many Uighurs detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.\n\nThe detention camp system is part of China\u2019s increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.\n\nNot all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn\u2019t have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,\u201d said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.\n\nInterviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director\u2019s words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to open a factory, you\u2019re going to work,\u201d Koksebek recalled him as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.\u201d\n\nThis fall, months after Koksebek\u2019s release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.\n\nIn October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that \u201csome trainees\u201d were nearly done with their \u201ccourses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,\u201d Zahir said.\n\nThe forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang\u2019s economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.\n\nA hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read \u201cHouse of Workers\u201d could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018, photo, residents pass by the entrance to the \"Hotan City apparel employment training base\" where Hetian Taida has a factory in Hotan in western China's Xinjiang region.\n\nMany of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder\u2019s wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.\n\nThen last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn\u2019t answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.\n\nFour months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for \u201cpolitical training.\u201d The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter\u2019s clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.\n\nLast month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar\u2019s brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.\n\nKaliaskar learned her daughter wasn\u2019t being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn\u2019t leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019re teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she\u2019s well educated and had a job,\u201d said Kaliaskar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this training?\u201d\n\nA former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.\n\nIf they ran from the factories, they were warned, they\u2019d be taken straight back to the camps for \u201cfurther education.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this file image from undated video footage run by China's CCTV, Muslim trainees work in a garment factory in the Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center in Hotan, Xinjiang, northwest China.\n\nFarmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing\u2019s past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.\n\n\u201cI never asked the government to find work for my husband,\u201d said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.\n\nShe has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she\u2019s not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek\u2019s husband used to earn.\n\nSince her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a factory, but it\u2019s an excuse for detention. They don\u2019t have freedom, there\u2019s no time for him to talk with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they found a job for him. I think it\u2019s a concentration camp.\u201d\n\n___"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "world", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/world-news/feed", "title": "3-Year-Old-Indian Girl Raped On 6th Anniversary Of Brutal Delhi Gang Rape", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indian-girl-raped_us_5c17c39be4b049efa754e380", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:43", "body_paragraphs": "A 40-year-old man was accused of raping his 3-year-old neighbor in New Delhi on Sunday, the sixth anniversary of a brutal gang rape that became a worldwide symbol of the dangers faced by women and girls.\n\nLocals found the victim lying face down and unconscious near a school in Bindapur, The Times of India reported.

Expansion would extend health care benefits to some 150,000 residents in Utah.\n\nBy Christine Vestal\n\nThe three red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 that bucked their own Republican legislatures last month and approved Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act are likely to proceed, despite Friday\u2019s ruling by a federal judge in Texas that the entire federal health care law is unconstitutional.\n\nEven in Montana, where voters last month defeated an extension of the temporary Medicaid expansion approved in 2015, legislative leaders predict that lawmakers will make the expansion permanent, since it is politically unpopular to take coverage away from people once it has been extended.\n\nVoter-approved Medicaid expansion would extend health care benefits to 91,000 low-income people in Idaho, nearly 90,000 in Nebraska and 150,000 in Utah.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in statute, so there\u2019s no turning back on it,\u201d Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat who has championed the plan, said in an interview Monday. \u201cThe only way we turn back on this is because it\u2019s repealed at the federal level.\u201d He said he\u2019s confident that won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t enact policy in our state because of pending court cases elsewhere, we\u2019d never enact policy,\u201d Morfeld said. \u201cThere are lawsuits on just about every federal program.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Utah\u2019s voter-approved Medicaid expansion is on track for swift implementation, according to Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, which supports the initiative. The state\u2019s Medicaid director is days away from submitting a so-called state plan amendment implementing the expansion. And the federal government is expected to approve it well in advance of its April effective date.\n\n\u201cWe see no reason to think the court decision will slow down the process in any way,\u201d Slonaker said. \u201cThis is a district court way down in Texas that is trying to be disruptive with very weak legal reasoning. Here in Utah, we\u2019re all systems go.\u201d\n\nIn Idaho, a Medicaid expansion referendum passed with over 60 percent of the vote, and had the support of the Republican governor, Butch Otter. In Nebraska and Utah, Republican governors opposed the expansion. (In Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock supported the ballot measure that would have extended the state\u2019s temporary Medicaid expansion rather than rolling back coverage.)\n\nWith the three states added to the list, 36 states plus Washington, D.C., have now approved Medicaid expansion, likely adding pressure on the remaining states to do so.\n\nLate Friday, U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional because when congressional Republicans eliminated the penalty for Americans who do not carry health insurance as part of their broader tax overhaul, they invalidated the health law. In his 55-page opinion, O\u2019Connor pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the ACA based on the idea that Congress has the power \u201cto impose a tax on those without health insurance.\u201d\n\nWithout the penalty, O\u2019Connor argued, there is no tax, and therefore the law is unconstitutional. Legal analysts from both sides of the political spectrum have cast doubt on that logic, predicting the decision will be appealed. In the meantime, the ACA stays in place.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic that Americans have made it clear that they want to expand access to care, not shrink it,\u201d said Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the Fairness Project, which helped bankroll the four state ballot initiatives.\n\nMontana voters defeated the Medicaid expansion ballot question this fall, but polls showed many were turned off by the idea of funding it with a tobacco tax; the tobacco industry spent mightily in opposition.\n\nNevertheless, Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature will be taking up expansion bills in January, and every bill is expected to get a chance at a hearing and a vote.\n\n\u201cThe legislature is very divided on this issue,\u201d said Montana Senate President Scott Sales, a Republican. Although he\u2019s trying to learn more about what Friday\u2019s court ruling might mean, he said, Democrats and the moderate wing of his party together likely have the votes to pass an expansion, though conservatives will work to impose cost-control measures.\n\nLen Nichols of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics cautioned that Friday\u2019s ruling gives \u201cammunition\u201d to expansion opponents who have raised concerns about the cost of expansion and whether the federal government will fulfill its pledge to cover 90 percent of the expense.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, it sows confusion, which may have been part of the goal,\u201d said Nichols, who served as a health care adviser to President Bill Clinton. \u201cIt does cast doubt on whether the law will survive.\n\n\u201cBetween the hard core opponents of the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s own ability to stir up opposition to it, and the fact that a number of people in the states are still opposed, it gives ammunition to those who want to delay.\u201d\n\nIn non-expansion states such as Kansas, where the Democratic governor-elect wants Medicaid expansion but the Republican majority legislature opposes it, the ruling could thwart or postpone any legislative plans to extend the low-income health care plan.\n\nIn Washington, Nina Owcharenko Schaefer, senior health policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview that the Texas decision highlights for states \u2014 particularly the ballot initiative states \u2014 \u201cthat things are still uncertain and they should proceed with caution as they look at the financial viability of this moving forward.\u201d\n\nWayne Hoffman, president of the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation think tank, counseled legislators to move cautiously in crafting the details of an expansion plan. Should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down Obamacare and its federal match for states\u2019 Medicaid expansion, he warned, \u201cthe costs would increase substantially.\u201d\n\n\u201cState legislators and the governor certainly need to be mindful of the fact there is a pretty big moving target when it comes to costs,\u201d Hoffman said in an interview Monday. His group also has a lawsuit pending in the Idaho Supreme Court that would declare November\u2019s ballot initiative unconstitutional. Arguments in that case are scheduled for Jan. 29.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suggesting that legislators do nothing,\u201d Hoffman said, and \u201cthat they bide their time and that we wait at least for a state Supreme Court to make the ruling before we get into actual implementation of anything.\u201d\n\nHe figures lawmakers in other states are paying attention too. Should states have to fund Medicaid expansion entirely on their own, he said, exponential cost increases would eat into state needs such as public safety and education.\n\n\u201cI think most legislatures are in session in 2019, and so this is going to have to be something top of mind, and whatever you implement is going to potentially be implemented forever,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThe price is going to be going up and up \u2026 It\u2019s going to be one of the larger [decisions] that legislators would make.\u201d\n\nMontana state Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming House speaker, agreed that states will have to adjust their Medicaid expansions should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down the Affordable Care Act."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Few Wells Are Tested For Contamination After Massive Flooding From Hurricanes Florence And Michael", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-wells-contamination_us_5c13c2ffe4b0cce3ea29d165", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Andrew Craft/Fayetteville Observer via AP A North Carolina home is flooded by Hurricane Florence. The storm dumped more than 30 inches of rain on the state.\n\nBy Rebecca Beitsch\n\nHundreds of thousands of homes in the Southeast may have had their wells inundated by record-level floodwater resulting from major hurricanes this year, yet only a fraction have been tested for harmful contaminants.\n\nThat\u2019s because North and South Carolina, Florida and Georgia \u2014 like most other states \u2014 don\u2019t require routine testing of private wells. Lawmakers have long been hesitant to put requirements on wells on private property.\n\nHurricanes Florence and Michael alone dumped more than 30 inches of rain on some areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina, creating a toxic soup that may have overwhelmed nearly 650,000 wells, according to estimates from the National Groundwater Association, an alliance of groundwater experts based in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nMore than 30 above-ground hog lagoons overflowed in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in September, sending pig waste into water inundating surrounding communities. Floodwater from Florence and Michael also contained agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants that can seep into the aquifer or flow into man-made wells through their ground-level ventilation systems.\n\nWithout data, though, scientists and public health officials won\u2019t know the full impact of the flooding on private wells.\n\nPublic health departments across the four states offered free well water tests to anyone affected by the hurricanes. Yet fewer than a thousand homeowners opted for water quality tests in each state, health departments said.\n\nAfter a natural disaster, relatively few people opt to get their water tested for contamination, often because they don\u2019t know there may be a problem or are afraid the results might hurt their home value. But even those who do may have never done so before, leaving many well water drinkers unable to pinpoint how long they\u2019ve been drinking bacteria-tainted water or the source of the contamination.\n\nThis is a particularly acute problem in North Carolina, where 2.4 million people rely on wells for their drinking water \u2014 the fifth-highest number in the nation, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and about a fifth of the state\u2019s population.\n\nThe state also is home to a high concentration of open pits filled with hog or chicken waste or coal ash, the residue from coal-fired power plants. That is joined by standard agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants picked up by floodwater.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s bacteria all over the ground,\u201d said Wilson Mize, an environmental health specialist with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 public health division. As waters rise, they inundate the above-ground portion of the well, which includes a small vent. \u201cIf you have over a foot of flooding, even on a perfectly constructed well, water is going to find its way in.\u201d\n\nA post-Florence recovery recommendation report from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said the state lab anticipated running 1,650 water tests, at a cost to the state of $36 each, but under 1,000 samples had been tested as of Nov. 30.\n\nResults from households that took advantage of the free testing show that in each of the four states, more than 30 percent of wells tested positive for coliform, bacteria that indicate surface water has entered a well. And in North Carolina, tests found that 13 percent of wells were contaminated with e. coli, a type of coliform associated with fecal matter.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with about 2 percent of wells that typically test positive for e. coli or other coliform in the Tar Heel State, the health department said.\n\nTravis Long/The News & Observer via AP A man helps his family move out of their flooded home in Kinston, North Carolina. Hurricane Florence flooded the Neuse River and devastated the town.\n\nNorth Carolina in 2008 began requiring new wells get tested shortly after they are constructed. South Carolina offers free \u2014 but voluntary \u2014 well water testing when a new well is constructed. Testing only at construction leaves older wells, potentially some of the most vulnerable to contamination, untested. Florida and Georgia have no testing requirements whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement under the law,\u201d said Chris Rustin, the director of environmental health at Georgia\u2019s Department of Public Health, adding that the state\u2019s lack of regulations is not unusual. \u201cIn most states, it\u2019s totally up to the homeowner to have the well samples and ensure water quality.\u201d\n\nGeorgia sampled 108 wells after Hurricane Michael hit in October, of which 43 percent were positive for coliform.\n\nMerritt Partridge, vice president of Partridge Well Drilling in Jacksonville, Florida, said his business usually gets more calls after a hurricane, often from people saying they heard on the news that their well might be contaminated. When he assures them that their well was unlikely to be affected unless their area was flooded, the tone of the call often changes.\n\n\u201cWe say it\u2019s always wise to get it tested, it\u2019s always good to know what\u2019s in your water, hurricane or not,\u201d Partridge said, \u201cBut that response almost always takes the edge off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen people say, \u2018Well how much is it? Is it worth it? I\u2019ve been drinking this water for the last 20 years,\u2019\u201d Partridge said, speaking of his experience after Hurricane Irma last year. \u201cSome people are drinking water that they shouldn\u2019t be, but they have no idea.\u201d\n\nTesting a well isn\u2019t very expensive, but a basic chlorine treatment that kills bacteria can cost around $500, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina was at greater risk of fecal contamination in wells than other states, in part because of the heavy rains that preceded Hurricane Florence, said Chuck Job, regulatory affairs manager with the groundwater association. He analyzed rainfall patterns from storms for the group to estimate how many wells were affected.\n\nCasey Toth/The News & Observer via AP Floodwater from Hurricane Florence creeps up on hog houses and a lagoon where hog waste is stored. At least 33 such lagoons overflowed during the floods.\n\nMost people with wells also rely on septic systems, which filter and store household waste underground. The two systems typically don\u2019t interact, Job said, but an already-saturated ground covered with floodwater might raise the water table, leaving the two systems \u201chydrologically connected.\u201d\n\nBut there could be other contributors of e. coli. At least 33 North Carolina hog lagoons overflowed because of rain from Hurricane Florence, according to the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s swine industry is concentrated in a part of the state uniquely vulnerable to its waste management practices,\u201d said Will Hendrick, a North Carolina-based staff attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental advocacy group. The hog lagoons are located mainly along the coastal plains, in an area with a high water table, high poverty rates and a large number of wells.\n\nHe pointed to a 2015 Johns Hopkins study that used genetic markers found in swine waste to determine hog lagoons were the source of contamination in nearby surface waters.\n\nBut some experts think hog lagoons are unlikely to be the source of contamination. Michael Burchell, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, joined scientists from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Virginia Tech, and the state, in testing well water for free for North Carolina residents affected by the hurricane.\n\nThe three universities targeted well users in areas with low testing rates, typically in communities with higher poverty rates and larger minority populations. Nearly a third of the 140 wells tested contained coliform.\n\nFloods mobilize all kinds of waste, Burchell said, including that of wild animals and pets. Usually flushing the well or using bleach or UV lights will solve problems tied to flooding.\n\nAndrew George, the community engagement coordinator with the UNC Institute for the Environment, went door to door with community leaders talking to people about the free testing being offered by the universities.\n\nMany homeowners are afraid to test their wells because of what they might find, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hurt their property value.\u201d\n\nAlthough more than 130 wells tested by the North Carolina health department were contaminated with e. coli, it\u2019s not clear anyone got sick from drinking bad well water, though many stomach illnesses go unreported to county health departments.\n\nHurricane Florence contributed to some of the worst flooding Smith has seen. Even in a county defined by its swampland, most of the land became submerged as rivers and lakes overflowed.\n\n\u201cThere were several of our towns that were like islands during the storm,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just cut off.\u201d\n\nHendricks said the Waterkeeper Alliance and other environmental groups in North Carolina are pushing for the state to include funding to help people pay to get their wells tested more regularly as part of a hurricane recovery package.\n\nCooper outlined a proposal that estimated $100 million was needed to repair damage to the state\u2019s public water and sewer infrastructure but was silent on funding for well water tests."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/us-news/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Steps Out For Solo Outing After Father's Insulting Interview", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meghan-markle-steps-out-for-solo-outing-after-fathers-insulting-interview_us_5c1908e5e4b0432554c476a3", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:44", "body_paragraphs": "Meghan Markle visited a nursing home in Twickenham, England, on Tuesday, just one day after her father gave an interview calling the former \u201cSuits\u201d actress \u201ccontrolling.\u201d\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex visited the Brinsworth House, a nursing home for British entertainers run by the Royal Variety Charity.

Their destination was 45 minutes away, so Michael decided to use the restroom one last time before boarding the bus.\n\nMichael had gotten into the habit at school of checking to make sure no one was in the boys bathroom before using it. He\u2019s not legally required to do so \u2015 but he said he had wanted to avoid the potential for any confrontation.\n\nOnce he determined the boys room was empty that day, Michael went into a stall. Moments later, Lee Livengood, one of two assistant principals at the school, allegedly entered the bathroom and began questioning why Michael was using it.\n\n\u201cI saw he was blocking the entrance to the bathroom,\u201d Michael told HuffPost in an interview on Monday. \u201cHe kept raising his voice and saying, \u2018Why are you in this bathroom? You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019\u201d\n\nACLU/Critchfield Family Michael Critchfield, 15, had told Liberty High School administrators before his freshman year that he identified as a boy and wanted to use the boys bathroom. They told him he couldn't, according to Michael and his mother, Caroline.\n\nLivengood then allegedly challenged Michael to \u201ccome out here and use the urinal\u201d if he\u2019s really a boy. Michael explained he was assigned female at birth but identified as a male.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t use this urinal, then you shouldn\u2019t be in here,\u201d Livengood shouted, according to Michael. \u201cWhat if a student said you were checking them out in here?\u201d\n\nSome of Michael\u2019s classmates could hear Livengood\u2019s tirade down the hall. Feeling something was wrong, they alerted a parent who was chaperoning the band trip that day.\n\nLivengood allegedly bullied Michael in the bathroom for three to four minutes before letting him leave. The chaperone was waiting outside the restroom as the teen drummer emerged, crying uncontrollably.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, you freak me out. Assistant Principal Lee Livengood, according to Michael\n\n\u201cI was like breaking down crying from all the stress,\u201d Michael told HuffPost. \u201cI was very anxious and frustrated. He wouldn\u2019t let me talk. It was very traumatizing.\u201d\n\nThe chaperone immediately confronted Livengood, who continued to misgender Michael and dismissed the incident as a simple \u201cmisunderstanding,\u201d according to Michael.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be rude or anything,\u201d Livengood allegedly said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, you freak me out.\u201d\n\nMichael described the ordeal as \u201cterrifying\u201d and \u201ctraumatizing,\u201d but decided to wait until after the band trip later that night to tell his mom what had happened. When Caroline picked her son up at school hours later, Michael and adults aware of the situation filled her in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Caroline told HuffPost. \u201cHow could someone who\u2019s supposed to be in an administrative position do something like this? ... It made me sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nCaroline spoke with Liberty High School administrators and the Harrison County Schools assistant superintendent the next day. The school district officials apologized to the Critchfields and promised Livengood wouldn\u2019t have any further contact with Michael and that there would be an investigation into the matter.\n\nBut nearly two months later, the Critchfields are still waiting for an update \u2015 and an apology from Livengood. The assistant principal continues to to be at the school daily and has stationed himself in the cafeteria during Michael\u2019s lunch period, which he hadn\u2019t done previously, according to the Critchfields.\n\n\u201cI just want to feel safe and welcome in my school,\u201d Michael said.\n\nACLU/Critchfield Family Michael Critchfield (second from right) with his mother Caroline (far right), his father Jon (far left) and his two brothers Daniel and William (center).\n\nThe Critchfields have tapped West Virginia\u2019s American Civil Liberties Union to represent them, hoping the constitutional rights advocacy group can provoke a response from \u2015 and meaningful change at \u2015 the high school.\n\n\u201cIt shocks the conscience that they\u2019ve apparently taken no steps to discipline Mr. Livengood on this,\u201d ACLU-WV Executive Director Joseph Cohen told HuffPost, adding that Michael has \u201csuffered significant anxiety\u201d since the incident.\n\nOn Monday, ACLU-WV sent a letter to Harrison County Schools Superintendent Mark Manchin on behalf of the Critchfields, requesting a meeting with the school district officials no later than Jan. 8.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Manchin had not responded to the letter. Neither Manchin nor a representative for Harrison County Schools responded to HuffPost\u2019s multiple requests for comment for this story.\n\nIn their letter, ACLU-WV and the Critchfields proposed three steps the high school should take to remedy the situation: one, implement best practice policies in Harrison County schools for handling unique issues faced by LGBTQ students; two, create annual required training for administrators, teachers and staff at Harrison County schools on how to handle LGBTQ-specific issues; and three, enforce the \u201cappropriate remedial discipline\u201d of Livengood.\n\nACLU-WV contends Liberty High School administrators may have violated several school policies, as well as state and federal laws, in this instance and in subsequent months by their lack of action.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to make school a place where [transgender students] can learn, a place where they can feel safe. ... It\u2019s a matter of life and death. Joseph Cohen, executive director of ACLU-WV\n\nCohen said he believes the matter can be resolved without litigation, but noted the Critchfields are ready to \u201cexplore all options\u201d if not.\n\nMichael has stopped using the boys bathroom since his upsetting interaction with Livengood. He\u2019s been given permission to use a bathroom in the school\u2019s office, but doesn\u2019t feel like he should have to be separated from his peers.\n\n\u201cIt tears me down inside,\u201d Michael said. \u201cEveryone else gets to use the bathroom they identify with. It\u2019s just not right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Michael who suffers in an instance like this, Cohen told HuffPost.

Pressed for an explanation, they\u2019ll offer a few words on the importance of free speech and content neutrality. But Rob Monster, the founder and CEO of the domain registrar Epik, loves talking about how he helped Gab, a social media site popular among white supremacists, get back online after a crisis.\n\nMonster registered Gab\u2019s domain in November, after several internet service providers abandoned the platform in response to one of its users allegedly killing 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. Since then, Monster, a Bible-quoting Christian, has defended Gab\u2019s violent neo-Nazis, smeared critics who call for more regulation on the site, and made baseless claims that the racists on Gab are actually fake accounts created by liberals who want to make Gab look bad.\n\nNicolas Ortega for HuffPost\n\nMonster insists his only goal is to move toward a world filled with \u201c#Peace,\u201d \u201c#LoveNotHate,\u201d \u201c#Truth\u201d and \u201c#FreeSpeech.\u201d He claims he is motivated by a commitment to free speech and a belief that he was put on this planet to bring people together through rational dialogue. He denies being an anti-Semite or a white supremacist. \u201cI have many Jewish friends, and have been called \u200b\u2018\u200bMensch\u200b\u2019\u200b many times\u200b,\u201d he wrote on Epik\u2019s blog last month.\n\nBut Monster\u2019s ideology and rhetoric can at times be almost indistinguishable from those of the neo-Nazis he\u2019s defended on Gab. And his actions have a broader significance: Gab\u2019s re-emergence marked a major setback for the growing activist-led movement to deplatform racists into irrelevance. The ease with which Monster, a tiny player in the tech community, was able to revive a gathering space for extremists illustrates the main limitation of deplatforming efforts: They require universal agreement. As long as one person, somewhere, is willing to host the hate, deplatforming doesn\u2019t work.\n\nRob Monster is willing to be that guy.\n\n\u2018The Swiss Bank Of Domains\u2019\n\nMonster, who is 51 and Dutch-American, was raised in Philadelphia, where he attended a Quaker school. After completing his MBA at Cornell, he got a job with Procter & Gamble that involved years-long stints in Germany and Japan. He went on to start his own market research company. Its board pushed him out in 2007.\n\nThat was the year that Monster found Jesus. \u201cI came to the deeply-researched conclusion that the God of the Bible is in fact the Creator of the Universe, and that the decision to accept the free gift of salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ is the path to eternal life,\u201d he said in a 2016 interview. (Monster did not respond to a list of nearly two dozen questions from HuffPost, including a question about his 2007 departure from his company.)\n\nMonster founded Epik in 2009 and described it as \u201cthe Swiss Bank of Domains,\u201d a neutral company that would take money from anybody \u2014 even Nazis. He promised exceptional customer service, and often appeared on internet message boards to personally respond to users.\n\nMonster launched his public defense of Gab in late October. A Gab user who\u2019d used the site to spew hate now stood accused of massacring Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and internet service providers were fleeing the site. Gab had gone offline after its registrar, GoDaddy, threatened to pull the domain.\n\nMonster has said he wasn\u2019t familiar with Gab before the Pittsburgh massacre. The day after the shooting, he claimed in post on NamePros, an online forum about domain names, that he\u2019d looked at an archived version of Gab and didn\u2019t see much troubling content there. He thought GoDaddy\u2019s response was \u201cheavy-handed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnother member of the forum told Monster that GoDaddy was simply enforcing its terms of service against encouraging violence. Monster countered by suggesting the Pittsburgh shooting was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d attack. When a third person on the forum accused Monster of trying to benefit from the Gab controversy and provide a breeding ground for extremists, Monster responded: \u201cI am a Bible-believing Christian. Some people think that means that I am crazy. Some people think that means I promote hate speech. Well, I am not crazy and I love everyone.\u201d\n\nMonster decided it was up to him to save Gab. He met with the site\u2019s founder Andrew Torba \u2014 who has actively recruited white nationalists to his platform \u2014 and concluded that Torba was a \u201cyoung, and once brash, CEO who is courageously doing something that looks useful.\u201d\n\nGab was back online about a week after it was shut down.\n\nMonster Gets On Gab\n\nAfter getting Gab back up and running, Monster created his own account and urged the site\u2019s users to be responsible \u201cstewards and partners.\u201d\n\nBut he was soon sounding a lot more like the site\u2019s most extreme users than a neutral tech CEO. Despite his diverse circle of friends, Monster appears at ease with the anti-Semitic slurs and racist fearmongering that are rampant on the site. Earlier this month, he approvingly shared a video by Faith Goldy, a Canadian white nationalist, that characterized migrants as the bearers of \u201crape epidemics, sharia law, and the spectacle of terror.\u201d\n\nHe also shared his own opinions. \u201cAre there a lot of \u2018Jewish\u2019 people who are in a position of power or influence and favor other \u2018Jewish\u2019 people, Ashkenazi, or otherwise? Sure. Do I think God is impressed by that? No, I do not,\u201d Monster posted on Gab in November. Monster doesn\u2019t wish Jewish people any harm, he said \u2014 \u201cGod will deal with them and in His time and His way regardless of hoaxes and conspiracies along the way.\u201d\n\nThat same month, when one Gab user accused Monster of talking like a \u201cRAT KIKE,\u201d he responded that he is \u201cnot a \u2018kike\u2019 nor governed by one. :-)\u201d When another person on Gab said he was pleased to know the site was hosted by a guy who wouldn\u2019t \u201ckowtow to globalists\u201d \u2014 a term commonly used as an anti-Semitic dog whistle \u2014 Monster responded, \u201cIndeed.\u201d Monster assured another Gab user who was worried about Epik having two Jewish board members that \u201chaving a Jewish person on Epik\u2019s board may be somewhat helping with keeping certain forces at bay.\u201d\n\nTal Moore, one of the Jewish board members, stepped down from the board earlier this month because of Epik\u2019s involvement with Gab, he told HuffPost. The other, Braden Pollock \u2015 who is married to the famous civil rights lawyer Lisa Bloom \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMonster The Conspiracist\n\nMonster\u2019s embrace of Gab\u2019s tone and tenor goes beyond cozying up to racists and anti-Semites. Like many who frequent Gab, he\u2019s also quick to cling to disinformation and conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cDid it ever cross anyone\u2019s mind that the story about the missionary disappearing after going on a mission work is Psyop?\u201d he posted last month, linking to a CNN story about an American missionary who traveled to North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal in an effort to convert its residents to Christianity. \u201cWhat better way to dissuade Christians from fulfilling the Great Commission than to convince that the Lord is not actually with them.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Monster theorized that a new swastika-ridden Gab account was really a \u201cfake Liberal account\u201d created by a faculty member in the psychology department at the State University of New York at Geneseo. He claimed that the phone number listed on the account\u2019s registration form matched the phone number on an outdated-looking website for the faculty member.\n\nThe accused professor hasn\u2019t taught at the university in decades and the website Monster referenced was from 1997, Monique Patenaude, the school\u2019s director of media relations, told HuffPost. The phone number Monster cited is out of service. The area code of that phone number is no longer used in Geneseo; it became a Buffalo area code in 2001, Patenaude said.\n\nHuffPost presented this information to Monster, who declined to comment on the record.\n\nMonster The Mediator\n\nMonster tells people who complain to him about Gab that he is not a Gab administrator. He tends to refer them to Torba, who has long ignored abusive behavior on the platform. But in one telling instance, Monster inserted himself as a mediator between some of the the platform\u2019s most notorious white supremacists and their critics \u2014 and came down on the side of the neo-Nazis.\n\nDays after Gab re-emerged online, Hilary Sargent, a writer who has been outspoken about white supremacy on Gab, tweeted that one Gab user, notable crying Nazi Chris Cantwell, was using the site to promote a video game called \u201cAngry Goy 2.\u201d Cantwell said the game would allow users to \u201chunt down and mercilessly kill as many trannies, faggots, niggers, kikes, and cucks as they possibly can.\u201d\n\nCantwell went after Sargent next. \u201cSomebody should develop a video game where the player rapes and strangles New York Times reporters while screaming anti-Semitic epithets at her,\u201d he wrote on Gab. Sargent, who has written for the Times but doesn\u2019t work there, reported Cantwell\u2019s post to Gab and posted a screenshot of it on Twitter.\n\nMonster responded by smearing Sargent.\n\n\u201cIf I were the @nytimes, I would not invite you back either,\u201d Monster tweeted. \u201cYour standard for journalism does not even measure up to the standard of the most dishonest grocery store tabloid. You play fast and loose with people\u2019s reputations, probably because you have nothing to lose. Sad.\u201d\n\nApparently encouraged by Monster\u2019s response, Cantwell proposed a third version of \u201cAngry Goy\u201d in which Sargent contracts a disease from transgender migrants and the player gains infinite lives by shooting her.\n\nCantwell\u2019s posts stayed up for days. When Monster finally heeded Sargent\u2019s requests and asked Cantwell to remove the posts, he cited his public relations problems \u2014 rather than any higher principle \u2014 as the reason. \u201cIt is causing grief that nobody needs,\u201d Monster wrote Cantwell in a private message on Gab. Cantwell complied.\n\nMonster later boasted about his intervention with Cantwell to Sargent. The neo-Nazi \u201chad a bit of a \u2018Road to Damascus\u2019 moment,\u201d Monster told Sargent in a private message on Twitter.\n\nCantwell disputes Monster\u2019s characterization of their conversation. He told HuffPost he doesn\u2019t mind removing the occasional Gab post if it makes Monster\u2019s life easier, because he sees the tech CEO as being on his side. But he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a religious awakening,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Rob called me up and I had a come-to-Jesus moment.\u201d\n\nThe neo-Nazi and the tech CEO continue to defend each other. Cantwell vouched for Monster to the conspiratorial racists on Gab who suspected him of being a Jewish infiltrator:\n\nSargent continued to send along evidence of white nationalist organizing on Gab. Monster claims he muted her. But he invited Patrick Little, one of the few white supremacists to get kicked off of Gab, to get in touch with him.\n\n\u201cRob Monster is \u2014 without question \u2014 making it easier for white supremacists and Nazis to spread hate,\u201d Sargent told HuffPost. \u201cAnd he has every right to do that, but he should own it.\u201d\n\nPicking A Side\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how much of Monster\u2019s behavior is sincere. His Gab theatrics have certainly won him some new business. Radio Aryan, a neo-Nazi site, and incels.is, a forum for misogynists who accuse women of depriving them of sex, both started working with Epik after Monster picked up Gab. \u201cOne of the two co-founders of this community is a mild-mannered Afro-American,\u201d Epik tweeted last month, referring to incels.is.\n\nBut even the white supremacists whose favored social network Monster is backstopping don\u2019t buy everything he\u2019s saying to defend Gab. Last month, he shared an image on Twitter claiming that 99 percent of neo-Nazis on Gab are actually liberals looking to \u201cgive enemies of freedom an excuse.\u201d\n\nSeems like a cry for attention. As near as I can tell this John Austin does not even exist. The folks at @getongab are doing a good job of enforcing Terms of Service.

Expansion would extend health care benefits to some 150,000 residents in Utah.\n\nBy Christine Vestal\n\nThe three red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 that bucked their own Republican legislatures last month and approved Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act are likely to proceed, despite Friday\u2019s ruling by a federal judge in Texas that the entire federal health care law is unconstitutional.\n\nEven in Montana, where voters last month defeated an extension of the temporary Medicaid expansion approved in 2015, legislative leaders predict that lawmakers will make the expansion permanent, since it is politically unpopular to take coverage away from people once it has been extended.\n\nVoter-approved Medicaid expansion would extend health care benefits to 91,000 low-income people in Idaho, nearly 90,000 in Nebraska and 150,000 in Utah.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in statute, so there\u2019s no turning back on it,\u201d Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat who has championed the plan, said in an interview Monday. \u201cThe only way we turn back on this is because it\u2019s repealed at the federal level.\u201d He said he\u2019s confident that won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t enact policy in our state because of pending court cases elsewhere, we\u2019d never enact policy,\u201d Morfeld said. \u201cThere are lawsuits on just about every federal program.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Utah\u2019s voter-approved Medicaid expansion is on track for swift implementation, according to Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, which supports the initiative. The state\u2019s Medicaid director is days away from submitting a so-called state plan amendment implementing the expansion. And the federal government is expected to approve it well in advance of its April effective date.\n\n\u201cWe see no reason to think the court decision will slow down the process in any way,\u201d Slonaker said. \u201cThis is a district court way down in Texas that is trying to be disruptive with very weak legal reasoning. Here in Utah, we\u2019re all systems go.\u201d\n\nIn Idaho, a Medicaid expansion referendum passed with over 60 percent of the vote, and had the support of the Republican governor, Butch Otter. In Nebraska and Utah, Republican governors opposed the expansion. (In Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock supported the ballot measure that would have extended the state\u2019s temporary Medicaid expansion rather than rolling back coverage.)\n\nWith the three states added to the list, 36 states plus Washington, D.C., have now approved Medicaid expansion, likely adding pressure on the remaining states to do so.\n\nLate Friday, U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional because when congressional Republicans eliminated the penalty for Americans who do not carry health insurance as part of their broader tax overhaul, they invalidated the health law. In his 55-page opinion, O\u2019Connor pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the ACA based on the idea that Congress has the power \u201cto impose a tax on those without health insurance.\u201d\n\nWithout the penalty, O\u2019Connor argued, there is no tax, and therefore the law is unconstitutional. Legal analysts from both sides of the political spectrum have cast doubt on that logic, predicting the decision will be appealed. In the meantime, the ACA stays in place.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic that Americans have made it clear that they want to expand access to care, not shrink it,\u201d said Colin Diersing, a spokesman for the Fairness Project, which helped bankroll the four state ballot initiatives.\n\nMontana voters defeated the Medicaid expansion ballot question this fall, but polls showed many were turned off by the idea of funding it with a tobacco tax; the tobacco industry spent mightily in opposition.\n\nNevertheless, Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature will be taking up expansion bills in January, and every bill is expected to get a chance at a hearing and a vote.\n\n\u201cThe legislature is very divided on this issue,\u201d said Montana Senate President Scott Sales, a Republican. Although he\u2019s trying to learn more about what Friday\u2019s court ruling might mean, he said, Democrats and the moderate wing of his party together likely have the votes to pass an expansion, though conservatives will work to impose cost-control measures.\n\nLen Nichols of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics cautioned that Friday\u2019s ruling gives \u201cammunition\u201d to expansion opponents who have raised concerns about the cost of expansion and whether the federal government will fulfill its pledge to cover 90 percent of the expense.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, it sows confusion, which may have been part of the goal,\u201d said Nichols, who served as a health care adviser to President Bill Clinton. \u201cIt does cast doubt on whether the law will survive.\n\n\u201cBetween the hard core opponents of the Affordable Care Act, the president\u2019s own ability to stir up opposition to it, and the fact that a number of people in the states are still opposed, it gives ammunition to those who want to delay.\u201d\n\nIn non-expansion states such as Kansas, where the Democratic governor-elect wants Medicaid expansion but the Republican majority legislature opposes it, the ruling could thwart or postpone any legislative plans to extend the low-income health care plan.\n\nIn Washington, Nina Owcharenko Schaefer, senior health policy research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview that the Texas decision highlights for states \u2014 particularly the ballot initiative states \u2014 \u201cthat things are still uncertain and they should proceed with caution as they look at the financial viability of this moving forward.\u201d\n\nWayne Hoffman, president of the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation think tank, counseled legislators to move cautiously in crafting the details of an expansion plan. Should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down Obamacare and its federal match for states\u2019 Medicaid expansion, he warned, \u201cthe costs would increase substantially.\u201d\n\n\u201cState legislators and the governor certainly need to be mindful of the fact there is a pretty big moving target when it comes to costs,\u201d Hoffman said in an interview Monday. His group also has a lawsuit pending in the Idaho Supreme Court that would declare November\u2019s ballot initiative unconstitutional. Arguments in that case are scheduled for Jan. 29.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suggesting that legislators do nothing,\u201d Hoffman said, and \u201cthat they bide their time and that we wait at least for a state Supreme Court to make the ruling before we get into actual implementation of anything.\u201d\n\nHe figures lawmakers in other states are paying attention too. Should states have to fund Medicaid expansion entirely on their own, he said, exponential cost increases would eat into state needs such as public safety and education.\n\n\u201cI think most legislatures are in session in 2019, and so this is going to have to be something top of mind, and whatever you implement is going to potentially be implemented forever,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThe price is going to be going up and up \u2026 It\u2019s going to be one of the larger [decisions] that legislators would make.\u201d\n\nMontana state Rep. Greg Hertz, a Republican and the incoming House speaker, agreed that states will have to adjust their Medicaid expansions should the U.S. Supreme Court eventually strike down the Affordable Care Act."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Few Wells Are Tested For Contamination After Massive Flooding From Hurricanes Florence And Michael", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-wells-contamination_us_5c13c2ffe4b0cce3ea29d165", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Andrew Craft/Fayetteville Observer via AP A North Carolina home is flooded by Hurricane Florence. The storm dumped more than 30 inches of rain on the state.\n\nBy Rebecca Beitsch\n\nHundreds of thousands of homes in the Southeast may have had their wells inundated by record-level floodwater resulting from major hurricanes this year, yet only a fraction have been tested for harmful contaminants.\n\nThat\u2019s because North and South Carolina, Florida and Georgia \u2014 like most other states \u2014 don\u2019t require routine testing of private wells. Lawmakers have long been hesitant to put requirements on wells on private property.\n\nHurricanes Florence and Michael alone dumped more than 30 inches of rain on some areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina, creating a toxic soup that may have overwhelmed nearly 650,000 wells, according to estimates from the National Groundwater Association, an alliance of groundwater experts based in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nMore than 30 above-ground hog lagoons overflowed in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in September, sending pig waste into water inundating surrounding communities. Floodwater from Florence and Michael also contained agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants that can seep into the aquifer or flow into man-made wells through their ground-level ventilation systems.\n\nWithout data, though, scientists and public health officials won\u2019t know the full impact of the flooding on private wells.\n\nPublic health departments across the four states offered free well water tests to anyone affected by the hurricanes. Yet fewer than a thousand homeowners opted for water quality tests in each state, health departments said.\n\nAfter a natural disaster, relatively few people opt to get their water tested for contamination, often because they don\u2019t know there may be a problem or are afraid the results might hurt their home value. But even those who do may have never done so before, leaving many well water drinkers unable to pinpoint how long they\u2019ve been drinking bacteria-tainted water or the source of the contamination.\n\nThis is a particularly acute problem in North Carolina, where 2.4 million people rely on wells for their drinking water \u2014 the fifth-highest number in the nation, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and about a fifth of the state\u2019s population.\n\nThe state also is home to a high concentration of open pits filled with hog or chicken waste or coal ash, the residue from coal-fired power plants. That is joined by standard agricultural runoff, fuel and other contaminants picked up by floodwater.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s bacteria all over the ground,\u201d said Wilson Mize, an environmental health specialist with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 public health division. As waters rise, they inundate the above-ground portion of the well, which includes a small vent. \u201cIf you have over a foot of flooding, even on a perfectly constructed well, water is going to find its way in.\u201d\n\nA post-Florence recovery recommendation report from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said the state lab anticipated running 1,650 water tests, at a cost to the state of $36 each, but under 1,000 samples had been tested as of Nov. 30.\n\nResults from households that took advantage of the free testing show that in each of the four states, more than 30 percent of wells tested positive for coliform, bacteria that indicate surface water has entered a well. And in North Carolina, tests found that 13 percent of wells were contaminated with e. coli, a type of coliform associated with fecal matter.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with about 2 percent of wells that typically test positive for e. coli or other coliform in the Tar Heel State, the health department said.\n\nTravis Long/The News & Observer via AP A man helps his family move out of their flooded home in Kinston, North Carolina. Hurricane Florence flooded the Neuse River and devastated the town.\n\nNorth Carolina in 2008 began requiring new wells get tested shortly after they are constructed. South Carolina offers free \u2014 but voluntary \u2014 well water testing when a new well is constructed. Testing only at construction leaves older wells, potentially some of the most vulnerable to contamination, untested. Florida and Georgia have no testing requirements whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement under the law,\u201d said Chris Rustin, the director of environmental health at Georgia\u2019s Department of Public Health, adding that the state\u2019s lack of regulations is not unusual. \u201cIn most states, it\u2019s totally up to the homeowner to have the well samples and ensure water quality.\u201d\n\nGeorgia sampled 108 wells after Hurricane Michael hit in October, of which 43 percent were positive for coliform.\n\nMerritt Partridge, vice president of Partridge Well Drilling in Jacksonville, Florida, said his business usually gets more calls after a hurricane, often from people saying they heard on the news that their well might be contaminated. When he assures them that their well was unlikely to be affected unless their area was flooded, the tone of the call often changes.\n\n\u201cWe say it\u2019s always wise to get it tested, it\u2019s always good to know what\u2019s in your water, hurricane or not,\u201d Partridge said, \u201cBut that response almost always takes the edge off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen people say, \u2018Well how much is it? Is it worth it? I\u2019ve been drinking this water for the last 20 years,\u2019\u201d Partridge said, speaking of his experience after Hurricane Irma last year. \u201cSome people are drinking water that they shouldn\u2019t be, but they have no idea.\u201d\n\nTesting a well isn\u2019t very expensive, but a basic chlorine treatment that kills bacteria can cost around $500, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina was at greater risk of fecal contamination in wells than other states, in part because of the heavy rains that preceded Hurricane Florence, said Chuck Job, regulatory affairs manager with the groundwater association. He analyzed rainfall patterns from storms for the group to estimate how many wells were affected.\n\nCasey Toth/The News & Observer via AP Floodwater from Hurricane Florence creeps up on hog houses and a lagoon where hog waste is stored. At least 33 such lagoons overflowed during the floods.\n\nMost people with wells also rely on septic systems, which filter and store household waste underground. The two systems typically don\u2019t interact, Job said, but an already-saturated ground covered with floodwater might raise the water table, leaving the two systems \u201chydrologically connected.\u201d\n\nBut there could be other contributors of e. coli. At least 33 North Carolina hog lagoons overflowed because of rain from Hurricane Florence, according to the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s swine industry is concentrated in a part of the state uniquely vulnerable to its waste management practices,\u201d said Will Hendrick, a North Carolina-based staff attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental advocacy group. The hog lagoons are located mainly along the coastal plains, in an area with a high water table, high poverty rates and a large number of wells.\n\nHe pointed to a 2015 Johns Hopkins study that used genetic markers found in swine waste to determine hog lagoons were the source of contamination in nearby surface waters.\n\nBut some experts think hog lagoons are unlikely to be the source of contamination. Michael Burchell, an associate professor at North Carolina State University, joined scientists from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Virginia Tech, and the state, in testing well water for free for North Carolina residents affected by the hurricane.\n\nThe three universities targeted well users in areas with low testing rates, typically in communities with higher poverty rates and larger minority populations. Nearly a third of the 140 wells tested contained coliform.\n\nFloods mobilize all kinds of waste, Burchell said, including that of wild animals and pets. Usually flushing the well or using bleach or UV lights will solve problems tied to flooding.\n\nAndrew George, the community engagement coordinator with the UNC Institute for the Environment, went door to door with community leaders talking to people about the free testing being offered by the universities.\n\nMany homeowners are afraid to test their wells because of what they might find, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hurt their property value.\u201d\n\nAlthough more than 130 wells tested by the North Carolina health department were contaminated with e. coli, it\u2019s not clear anyone got sick from drinking bad well water, though many stomach illnesses go unreported to county health departments.\n\nHurricane Florence contributed to some of the worst flooding Smith has seen. Even in a county defined by its swampland, most of the land became submerged as rivers and lakes overflowed.\n\n\u201cThere were several of our towns that were like islands during the storm,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just cut off.\u201d\n\nHendricks said the Waterkeeper Alliance and other environmental groups in North Carolina are pushing for the state to include funding to help people pay to get their wells tested more regularly as part of a hurricane recovery package.\n\nCooper outlined a proposal that estimated $100 million was needed to repair damage to the state\u2019s public water and sewer infrastructure but was silent on funding for well water tests."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/health/feed", "title": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Gets Real About Self-Care, Burnout: 'It's NOT CUTE'", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-gets-real-about-self-care-burnout-its-not-cute_us_5c18ffd1e4b02d2cae8d5bb6", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:46", "body_paragraphs": "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez revealed in a quirky Instagram post that she\u2019s taking time off for self-care in an effort to prevent burnout as she prepares to take her seat in Congress.\n\n\u201cI am starting a week of self-care where I am taking the week off and taking care of me.

It\u2019s like some kind of bizarre adult sleepover \u2015 except it\u2019s midday on a Friday afternoon, and from what I\u2019ve been told the next six hours could unfold into one of the most profound experiences of my life.\n\nThese days, it may not sound unusual for a 20-something to sign up for a four-day retreat with fifteen strangers in a foreign country to embark on a journey of \u201cself-discovery.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s probably a very millennial thing to do. This particular one had all the expected components: meditation, dancing, singing around a fire, breathing workshops ... and a whole day dedicated to drinking a tea infused with magic mushrooms.\n\nI\u2019m kidding \u2015 they weren\u2019t magic mushrooms, they were \u201cmagic truffles,\u201d an underground part of the mushroom that, curiously, has not been banned by Dutch law, which means that, along with cannabis, you can legally buy them in shops on the high street.\n\nThe retreats are run by the UK Psychedelic Society in the Netherlands and, as a filmmaker, I was participating for the purposes of research for a documentary about whether psychedelics can be an effective form of therapy.\n\nArriving in Amsterdam on a sunny afternoon, I met up with the group and was immediately taken aback by how many different accents I could hear. Compared to stories of plane journeys with multiple changeovers, my delayed four-hour Eurostar trip from London didn\u2019t seem so bad. We each bought two packs of vacuum-packed brownish blobs called \u201cHigh Hawaiians\u201d before heading to the retreat venue in the luscious Dutch countryside.\n\nSandwiched between several days of preparation and integration, the actual psychedelic experience takes place on Day 2. On the first day, participants meet and take part in exercises that gently, but thoroughly, prepare us for the enormity of what we are about to experience. We talk about our \u201cintentions\u201d for the trip, which range from pure curiosity, improving creativity or being a better parent to grappling with heartbreak, loneliness or coming to terms with a traumatic childhood.\n\nA morning movement workshop, individual check-ins, delicious vegan food and a sacred sage ceremony soon lull our anxiousness into a sense of security and safety. We are ready to take the \u201cplant medicine.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Hana Wolf The author photographed in the woods in the Netherlands during the retreat.\n\nFifteen minutes after gulping down the psychedelic tea, my eyes start streaming. I suddenly have no control over my tear ducts. Everyone else looks calm, but gradually emotions erupt and spread like dominoes on fire. People are laughing, crying, snorting, shaking. My heart beats rapidly, and my body temperature drops. I am a shivering, sobbing mess. Fortunately, the facilitators sense when you need reassurance, a hug, a blanket or food, and serenely float around the room helping us throughout our journeys.\n\nA specially curated playlist reverberates loudly on speakers, encouraging us to experience a range of emotions. It feels like a rollercoaster of existential purging, and wasn\u2019t long before I could not differentiate the music from myself \u2015 however odd it sounds. We were the same. Later, I could see the music in front of me as a physical thing: a bright yellow synaesthetic web of intricate pulsating patterns. I was entranced with delight and awe.\n\nBut before that there were moments of deep reflection and sadness, including a piercing realization that my family\u2019s and my own time on this earth is limited. I saw a cartoon cutout world of my childhood home from a bird\u2019s-eye view. Time swallowed the house, papering it over with trees, ignorant to my happy memories or the significance of it being my own roots. It seemed nature was reminding me of its omnipresence and ability to exist with or without us.\n\nNext was the experience of death \u2015 or rather, being engulfed by the universe and no longer existing in bodily form \u2015 while simultaneously feeling unified with everything. This experience of confronting one\u2019s own mortality is common in situations like this, and is one of the reasons psychedelics have been used in trials to help end-of-life cancer patients come to terms with their terminal diagnosis.\n\nI lost all grasp of time: a minute felt like hours, the days of the week were nonsensical words. I realized that, actually, I did not exist before this. I couldn\u2019t fathom how I was going to make a documentary that portrayed this experience, or indeed, go back to work at all. What even was my life? What was \u201clife\u201d as a concept at all?\n\nFifteen minutes after gulping down the psychedelic tea my eyes start streaming. Everyone else looks calm, but gradually emotions erupt and spread like dominoes on fire. People are laughing, crying, snorting, shaking. My heart beats rapidly, and my body temperature drops. I am a shivering, sobbing mess.\n\nI wondered how anyone had ever jumped off a bridge or balcony on this drug. Just sitting up took an inordinate amount of mental and physical strength. I sensed that my bladder was full and heaved my body to the bathroom with the help of a facilitator. I looked in the mirror and saw myself with gray hair \u2015 as an old lady. Then a baby-faced reflection \u2015 myself as a child. I giggled. What was my mind trying to tell me?\n\nBack in the room, I sat down and closed my eyes. This time revealed a vast expansive vision of delicate glass flowers in a white room. Each flower represented a living person, each one so unique and fragile. It reminded me that everyone is intrinsically valuable, and that vision remains one of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed.\n\nCrucially, the days following the ceremony are dedicated to helping make sense of your trip and developing tools to positively integrate the experience into our daily lives. We hug, we walk in the woods, we write, we sing, we laugh, we cry and we share our deepest secrets. We have been to infinity and back together. Having been strangers just 36 hours ago, we are now firmly cemented into the fabric of each other\u2019s lives.\n\nThese isolated visions will not change your life; action is required for change. But they might ignite something within you, and for people with a mental illness that could be a lifeline. For people like my brother, who has suffered with severe OCD and depression for the best part of a decade, it could be an exciting alternative treatment option. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has recently granted \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d status to psilocybin (the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms / truffles) which should accelerate research for treating conditions such as PTSD and depression. And with clinical trial results looking very promising so far, some U.K. scientists predict that psilocybin-assisted therapy could be a part of the National Health Service as early as 2021.\n\nCourtesy of Rebecca Coxon The group takes part in integration exercises after the psychedelic ceremony.\n\nI remember telling myself during my trip that only those who really need to do this should do it. The first half of the experience was more intense, overwhelming and confusing than I could possibly put into words. That\u2019s also the reason many believe it could be helpful for those suffering with certain mental illnesses; it gives you a radical new perspective and breaks your habitual patterns, even if just for a few hours. This could be transformative for someone locked in the negativity of their own mind. It is important to note, however, that psychosis-based conditions should not be combined with psychedelics, as they could do more harm than good.\n\nDrugs are readily associated with addiction, and it\u2019s easy to park psychedelics in that group too. But from personal experience, talking to neuroscientists and filming other peoples journeys, it doesn\u2019t seem to be an experience that one rushes back to. In fact, rather ironically, scientists are now experimenting with psychedelics to treat addiction. What\u2019s more, a euphoric \u201chigh\u201d is not guaranteed, nor is it the high the kind typically associated with other drugs such as cocaine or heroin. Psychedelics are also generally inconveniently time-consuming affairs, with \u201cjourneys\u201d brought on by substances such as Ayahuasca and LSD lasting up to 15 hours.\n\nFor me, the experience has helped me to appreciate what I have and develop a deeper gratitude for it. When I went on to film the retreat the following month for my documentary, there were varying experiences. One attendee described it as \u201cone of the best things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d while another admitted that her life had been \u201cshattered and turned upside down\u201d by the experience. She had expected to come out \u201ctotally healed\u201d of her problems, but soon realized that isn\u2019t quite how it works. The problem, or perhaps advantage, of psychedelics is that they are so wildly unpredictable. You simply don\u2019t know what they will offer up \u2015 or, indeed, how you will react to any insights that arise from the pits of your subconscious.\n\nRetreats like the one I experienced are popping up all over the world, and appealing to societies that are increasingly feeling disconnected, hopeless and fearful of each other. Coupled with health services that struggle to penetrate mental illness with any meaningful force, it\u2019s no wonder that people are deciding to take their mental health into their own hands.\n\nFor me, the experience can be described as like looking down the barrel of your whole life \u2015 but not in a linear, photo album kind of way, but more like a scattered scrapbook of your fears, hopes and hard truths.\n\nFittingly, for an experience that seems to connect random people so immediately and deeply, the breadth of human experience is truly witnessed at retreats like this. A broad spectrum of ages, religions, colors, cultures, genders and professions undertake the same journey under the same cozy roof. It almost makes me wonder if every war and conflict in the world could be nullified by gathering leaders into a room and connecting them through a psychedelic experience in this same way. But then I remind myself that this overly idealistic way of thinking is perhaps one of the reasons psychedelics were banned in the 60s ...\n\nFor me, the experience can be described as like looking down the barrel of your whole life \u2015 but not in a linear, photo album kind of way, but more like a scattered scrapbook of your fears, hopes and hard truths. For some people that will be appealing and feel necessary for healing. For others, it will sound like a nightmare.\n\nPsychedelics may not be the \u201cmagic pill\u201d for mental illness or the \u201ccure\u201d for a sick society that many of us are desperately hoping for, but it is impossible to deny their power. And with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nRebecca\u2019s documentary \u201cThe Mind Explorers: A Psychedelic Weekend\u201d is available to watch here."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Meghan Markle Tops Google's Global Trending Charts For 2018", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-search-results-2018_us_5c10fb55e4b0ac53717a68a0", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "It\u2019s official!

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.\n\nMusk\u2019s aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.\n\nAt the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area.\n\nBut opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept.\n\nPrecise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.\n\n\u201cThe parties ... have amicably settled the matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.\u201d\n\nPlans for Boring\u2019s so-called \u201cDugout Loop,\u201d an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city\u2019s Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company\u2019s website.\n\nAn initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city\u2019s Public Works Department in late August.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we\u2019re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,\u201d Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWon\u2019t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.\u201d\n\nBoring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called \u201cskates\u201d from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).\n\nThe Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark\u2019s capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring\u2019s website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.\n\nIn June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city\u2019s downtown to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Facebook Has Had A Very Bad Week.

That\u2019s me. Mark and Sheryl relied on me to manage this without controversy,\u201d he wrote, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the two biggest faces of the company.\n\nThe system he created to manage such partnerships \u201cfailed here and I\u2019m sorry I let you all down,\u201d he added. \u201cI regret my own failure here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s facing a civil rights and safety audit and more\n\nOne of the groups targeted in the Definers smear was the racial justice organization Color of Change, which was founded by Soros\u2019 son and often partners with the anti-Facebook group Freedom From Facebook.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Definers scandal broke, Facebook agreed to the group\u2019s demands that it carry out a civil rights and safety audit. Two outside advisers are conducting both a legal audit of its impact on underrepresented communities and communities of color and an audit advising the company on potential bias against conservative voices, Axios first reported.\n\nNow, Color of Change says Facebook needs to promise more, including making a commitment to a timeline for publicly releasing the results of the audit and taking meaningful steps to address the harms raised.\n\n\u201cDenying problems and attacking critics is not a winning strategy,\u201d Color Of Change president Rashad Robinson said. \u201cWithout clear, immediate and systemic change at Facebook, Color Of Change will have no choice but to escalate our work with other parties to hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nSandberg is meeting with the group this week to address its other demands, including firing Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who attended his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nUK lawmakers are threatening to drop some potentially explosive documents.\n\nFacebook is also scrambling this week to stop British lawmakers from releasing the company\u2019s internal legal documents that it seized from another business in a lawsuit with Facebook.\n\nThe documents are believed to contain confidential emails about Facebook\u2019s data and privacy controls and could shed more damning light on how Facebook\u2019s privacy policy allowed Cambridge Analytica to obtain 87 million users\u2019 personal data.\n\nThe company was pressed on that Tuesday at a British Parliament hearing with lawmakers from nine other countries as part of the part of the U.K. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee\u2019s inquiry into disinformation and fake news.\n\nZuckerberg was a no-show.\n\n9 countries.\n\n24 official representatives.\n\n447 million people represented.\n\n\n\nOne question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3 \u2014 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsCMS) November 27, 2018\n\nHis absence looked \u201cnot great,\u201d Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy solutions, told lawmakers when asked to speak on it, CNBC reported. He is also a member of the Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAn ex-employee accused Facebook of having \u201ca black people problem.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, an ex-Facebook employee publicly released a lengthy statement coming down hard on the company for failures in how it treats black employees and black users of the platform.\n\nMark Luckie, who is black and served as the strategic partner manager for global influencers with a focus on underrepresented voices, said he first circulated the letter among all Facebook employees earlier this month, days before he left the company.\n\n\u201cIn some buildings, there are more \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 posters than there are actual black people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim that it is connecting communities if those communities aren\u2019t represented proportionately in its staffing.\u201d\n\nHe also described a widespread problem of non-black people reporting posts by black people as \u201chate speech\u201d in alerts to Facebook, when often those posts are \u201cmeant to be positive efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a prevailing theory among many black users that their content is more likely to be taken down on the platform than any other group,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven though the theories are mostly anecdotal, Facebook does little to dissuade people from this idea.\u201d\n\nLuckie\u2019s piece is worth a read in its entirety.\n\nBlame is bubbling up around Sandberg.\n\nOn Monday, the once highly revered Sandberg came under fire in a Bloomberg piece that featured criticisms from eight current and former Facebook employees from her side of the company.\n\nIn the piece, they relay stories of Sandberg prioritizing her own relationships and personal success at the sake of those of the company, disregarding advice from her aides on how to handle the congressional hearing on Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. presidential election and surrounding herself with employees who shield her from all criticism and bad news.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so brutal to people, no one wants to bring her anything,\u201d one of the sources said of having to have hard conversations with Sandberg."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Ohio Becomes First U.S. State To Allow Businesses To Pay Taxes With Bitcoin", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-taxes-bitcoin_us_5bfcf6b2e4b03b230fa652f4", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:48", "body_paragraphs": "Ohio has just become the first U.S. state and one of the first governments in the world to allow businesses to pay taxes, including sales and public utility taxes, with bitcoin.\n\nState Treasurer Josh Mandel announced Monday that businesses can now register for the program through the website OhioCrypto.com, a portal that will, via a third-party processor called BitPay, convert the digital currency into dollars that will then be deposited into the state\u2019s accounts.\n\nBusinesses that operate in Ohio will be able to use bitcoin to pay for 23 different types of taxes, Mandel\u2019s office said in a press release.

In an account of Mr. Flynn\u2019s F.B.I. interview filed in court late Monday, agents described in detail how he falsely answered their questions.\n\nHis sentencing hearing came amid a flurry of activity in criminal cases that have involved the Trump campaign, the White House and the president himself.\n\nLast week, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime fixer, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes including organizing hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to cover up potential sex scandals that threatened Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid.

He pleaded guilty a year ago to misleading them about a series of discussions he had with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.\n\nProsecutors have said Mr. Flynn\u2019s deceptions impeded the F.B.I.\u2019s open investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow\u2019s covert effort to tip the presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. Mr. Trump has said he fired Mr. Flynn because he had also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\n\nMr. Flynn has now admitted that after the outgoing Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential race, he requested that Russia not escalate tensions between the two countries.

The commission\u2019s focus was part of a broader effort to reject the previous administration\u2019s race-conscious education efforts, which have included siding with Asian students suing Harvard to end affirmative action and delaying an Obama-era rule to prevent disproportionate numbers of minority children from being funneled into special education classes.\n\nThe documents obtained by The Times \u2014 a draft letter and a draft chapter of the safety commission\u2019s research \u2014 focus significantly on race and promote the idea that the federal crackdown on potentially discriminatory practices has made schools more dangerous."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Politics.xml", "title": "Judge Postpones Sentencing of Michael Flynn After Harshly Rebuking Him", "article_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/michael-flynn-sentencing.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "accessed_time": "2018-12-18 19:01:52", "body_paragraphs": "Prosecutors dismissed the claims that Mr. Flynn had been tricked as a poor excuse, saying that as a high-ranking White House official and the former director of an intelligence agency, he was well aware that misleading federal authorities was a felony offense.\n\n\u201cThe seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense cannot be called into question, and the court should reject his attempt to minimize it,\u201d prosecutors wrote last week after Mr. Flynn\u2019s legal team made the assertion.

The Justice Department had initially decided that the executive branch lacked the authority to ban bump stocks on its own under existing gun-control laws, and that action in Congress \u2014 where it is politically difficult to enact new gun-control legislation \u2014 would be necessary to curb legal access to the devices.\n\n[Read our explainer on bump stocks.]\n\nBut the department reinterpreted its legal authority and determined it could ban the devices as an executive action after President Trump directed it to find a way to prohibit them earlier this year, following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

But he largely ignored the 2017 congressional action. In essence, legal scholars said, he looked to one congressional view and not the more recent one.\n\nAnd in so doing, he opened the door for House Democrats to intervene in successive appeals. On Saturday aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become the next speaker of the House, said she would move quickly to notify the Trump administration that House Democrats intended to step in to defend the law in the case.\n\nAs the legal showdown plays out, efforts to protect the A.C.A. are also underway in the courts. Earlier this year the state attorney general of Maryland sued the Trump administration for attempting to gut the act. The case is pending.\n\nNicholas Bagley, a health law expert at the University of Michigan, suggested that Judge O\u2019Connor may not yet be done with the case. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr. Bagley noted that the judge had not yet addressed a handful of central issues in the suit, nor had he issued a final ruling indicating whether the act should fall immediately. Judge O\u2019Connor could indeed hold onto the case before an appellate court takes it up.\n\nBut if he lets the case move forward, a likely timeline, according to many legal experts, is that the case will be taken up by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans this spring. If the Fifth Circuit upholds Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court is likely to agree to hear the case in its term that starts in October 2019, with a decision in 2020. If the Fifth Circuit overturns the judge\u2019s ruling and upholds the law, there is a good chance the Supreme Court would decline to even take the case, legal scholars said."}, {"site": "NYT", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Health.xml", "title": "Global Health: The World Needs a Urine Test for TB.

About 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from it. Chronic high blood pressure can force the heart to work too hard over time, weakening it and leading to heart failure. Treatment usually involves trying to strengthen the contractions of the heart muscle with drugs, or reducing the volume of blood with other drugs (like diuretics) or by restricting salt intake.\n\nRecently, researchers searched for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of reduced sodium intake to treat heart failure. In all the literature, they found nine studies that involved 479 patients. One of them was published only in abstract form. None involved more than 100 patients. Over all, none were considered at low risk for bias.\n\nThere were no data that showed that salt restriction reduced mortality or cardiac disease; affected whether someone was admitted to the hospital; or influenced how long they had to stay if admitted. Of four outpatient studies, two showed no improvement in heart function, and two did."}]
