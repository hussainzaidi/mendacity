They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 44 homes and six other locations and found lead levels were at the legal limit. It wasn't enough to sound alarm bells.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "They drive 20 miles roundtrip for clean water", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/OGhCzlj2vTk/dirty-water-testing-denmark-orig-mg.cnn", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "For almost 10 years, a South Carolina couple saved jars of tap water worried there was something wrong with it.

That's when she saw a warning on Facebook for residents of her small Western Michigan town to stop drinking the water.\n\nIn Michigan, water main breaks aren't unusual, although they're more common in winter. It didn't immediately strike Cooper as out of the ordinary to not be able to drink the water.\n\nBut the Facebook message made no mention of the run-of-the-mill breaks or chloroform warnings; rather, the city's July 26 post said, \"We have just been informed this afternoon by the [Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] that the PFAS level in a City well is 1400 ppt. The limit being 70 ppt.\"\n\nIt advised using bottled water for cooking, drinking and making baby formula.\n\n\"I immediately felt really sick,\" Cooper said.\n\nPFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a family of more than 4,000 synthetic chemicals that degrade very slowly, if at all, in the environment. Some of the best-known chemicals are PFOS, PFOA and GenX.\n\nIt's not the first time Michigan has dealt with toxic tap water; the legacy of Flint is not far behind. But unlike in the Flint lead crisis, it's unknown how long the water in Parchment has been contaminated with PFAS.\n\nNow, all Cooper could see were toxins all over her house, poisoning her nearly 3-year-old daughter, Jillian, who has lived in Parchment most of her life.\n\n\"You look around and you have sippy cups around,\" she said. Every cup of water -- in fact, anything using the water -- became suspect.\n\nA persistent problem\n\nThe chemicals have been used for decades on military bases and in industrial areas in the manufacturing of thousands of consumer items including food packaging materials, water-resistant fabrics, nonstick cooking pans and firefighting foams.\n\n\"They're extremely strong, and they are extremely persistent, and that's what makes them so good for nonstick, waterproof and stain-repellant products,\" said Tom Bruton, a scientist with the Green Science Policy Institute in Berkeley, California.\n\nThe chemicals are no longer manufactured in the United States. In 2002, 3M, the primary US manufacturer of PFOS, voluntarily phased out production of the chemical. In 2006, eight major companies in the PFAS industry agreed to stop production of PFOA and PFOA-related chemicals by 2015.\n\nBut they can still be found all around us, including in the water.\n\n\"I think that people should be concerned about the amount of PFOA and PFOS that is in our environment,\" Susan M. Pinney, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati, wrote in an email. \"These are chemicals with long half-lives,\" meaning they can persist in the environment as well as the body. According to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, they can stay in the body two to nine years\n\n\"Exposure in utero may have the greatest effect on developing children ... and effects may last into adulthood,\" Pinney said, adding that the research is early and so is not definitive.\n\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency, PFAS exposure has been linked to low birth weight, immunological disorders, cancer and thyroid hormone disruption.\n\nAnd that is what exactly worries Cooper. She can't help but wonder whether the more than two years her family has lived in Parchment have been the root of their health issues.\n\n\"You just start thinking, 'well, we were sick a lot,' \" she said.\n\nIs it the water? Could it be breast milk?\n\nCooper and her husband David prioritize healthy living: They buy organic food; they wash their hands often; they diligently use laundry detergent \"free and clear\" of unnecessary chemicals; she breastfed her daughter for nearly 3 years. So could there be a connection to the water? After all, her thyroid hormone levels went down after her pregnancy. \"It causes all these questions,\" she said.\n\nHer biggest concern is Jillian. She was small, measuring in the 10th percentile for weight when they moved to Parchment when she was 6 months old. A year later, she had dropped below the 1st percentile in weight. After Cooper focused on feeding her a higher-fat and -protein diet, Jillian's weight is now in the 4th percentile.\n\n\"Is it the water?\" Cooper wonders. Could it have been her breast milk? \"She's nursed the entire duration that we've lived here. Everything that I've read, if you're nursing a child, you're passing it on to them.\"\n\n\n\nPFOS and PFOA are found in blood and at lower levels in breast milk and umbilical cord blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Environmental Health\n\nTammy Cooper worries that the water in Parchment could have harmed her daughter, Jillian.\n\nCooper reached out to Jillian's pediatrician immediately after she read the Facebook announcement. Her doctor is concerned there could be a connection between the water and Jillian's growth, but there is little to nothing they can do about it now.\n\nSince the city's announcement, Cooper decided to wean her daughter off breastfeeding. \"I didn't want it to end this way. The last thing I want to remember is this special thing to be terminated because of this thing in the water,\" she said.\n\n\"Maybe I don't have any health issues from the water, but there's a major cost to your mental health, because you're in charge of this little person, and you feel like you're failing.\"\n\nIt's an anxiety that has occupied many other parents in the area, like Sara Dean.\n\nDean and her husband settled in Parchment three years ago after searching for a place to raise their children. They worried that their hometown of Chicago was too busy and potentially too violent of a place to raise a family.\n\nParchment was beautiful. Neighbors spoke to on another. It seemed like a great place to start a family.\n\n\"We moved to a state associated with healthy living, pure water -- all the things with the Pure Michigan campaign -- and now we're like, what did we do? Would we have been better off starting a family in Chicago? At least the water is safe. There is a lot of questioning if we made the right decision three years ago.\"\n\nA national problem\n\nWhat's happening in Parchment isn't unique. The state of Michigan has confirmed at least 34 sites that have been contaminated with the chemicals. The state has been testing potential sites across Michigan since 2017.\n\nOn July 29, Michigan declared a state of emergency over Parchment's water. Although a specific source of the PFAS contamination has not been identified, the state Department of Environmental Quality has tested an area where PFAS might have been used. The state is also testing private residential tests to understand how far the contamination has spread.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group and Northwestern University have mapped 94 sites across the country affected by PFAS. The US Department of Defense has listed 36 contaminated military installations\n\nThe EPA has called PFAS a national priority.\n\nhealth risks because it could be a The contaminant became a political lightning rod this year when internal White House emails revealed that the Trump administration tried to withhold a US Department of Health and Human Services report on the chemicals'health risks because it could be a \"potential public relations nightmare.\" The report, which was eventually released in June, found that the current EPA-recommended level was seven to 10 times higher than it should be.\n\nIn May, the agency held a national leadership summit on PFAS but blocked several media outlets, including CNN, from attending.\n\nThis summer, the EPA hosted \"community engagement\" events in Exeter, New Hampshire; Horsham, Pennsylvania; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Fayetteville, North Carolina -- all communities affected by contaminated water.\n\nAt the event this week in Fayetteville, the agency addressed residents who have found elevated levels of the chemical GenX, a second-generation PFAS, in private drinking water wells.\n\nJohn Pate, a resident of the area, told CNN affiliate WRAL that it's not just the immediate impact he's concerned about. \"We could be still looking at, 20 years down the road, people coming up with things. We don't know,\" Pate said.\n\nBruton, of the Green Science Policy Institute, expects the number of affected communities to continue to grow.\n\n\"The more we monitor water supplies, the more widespread we find these chemicals to be,\" he said.\n\nTrying to find peace of mind\n\nDean can't help but wonder what the impact of Parchment's water has been on her 2-year-old boy and the child with which she is 30 weeks pregnant. Like Jillian, Dean's son, Patrick, is on the smaller side, and her baby is measuring smaller in the womb.\n\n\"Do I make small babies,\" Dean questions, \"or do I make small babies because I drink poisoned water?\"\n\nWithin hours of hearing the news of the elevated levels, the city of Parchment quickly set up a bottled water distribution system. City officials are currently working to connect residents to the nearby Kalamazoo water system.\n\nAccording to the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health , the major pathway for PFAS exposure is ingestion. Aside from contaminated drinking water, PFAS can be found around the house, Bruton said. It's in the dust from stain-treated carpets and upholstery, in some packaged foods and in foods cooked in nonstick pans.\n\nParchment's water advisory says it's safe to use the water for cleaning and washing purposes. Bathing is also fine because absorption of PFAS through the skin is slow and insignificant.\n\nSara Dean wonders whether her family should have moved from her hometown of Chicago.\n\nBut when Dean takes a dish out of the dishwasher, she will run bottled water over it \"for peace of mind.\"\n\nDean and her husband have also installed a reverse-osmosis water filter in their home. Reverse osmosis filters certified by NSF International can reduce PFAS levels to below levels set by the EPA.\n\nIt's something Don Rome is also considering. It's well worth the cost to protect his wife, their 13-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son, and their pets, he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure I'll be going back to drinking directly from the tap without filters. So there is some uncertainty there. It's all a new frontier,\" Rome said.\n\nAnd when Rome swims in their pool or takes a shower, there's always some thought about it in the back of his mind. \"You don't intend to drink the water, but it gets in your mouth. ... Things happen.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nRome has a lot of confidence in the city. He feels that officials have done a good job of communicating actions taken to keep residents safe, including the efforts to connect to the Kalamazoo system.\n\nBut there is no question in Rome's mind that the water has impacted all parts of the city.\n\nRome tracks real estate in Parchment in his job. He noticed the pace of home sales has slowed since the PFAS announcement.\n\n\"There has been a slowdown in interest and foot traffic,\" he said.\n\nFor Cooper, the impact of the PFAS contamination has been significant. Her house is being used as one of the city's testing sites. It has created a sense of distrust that wasn't there before.\n\n\"You backtrack on everything that you ever believed in, everything about your safety,\" she said.\n\n\"If you can't trust the government about water, what can you trust them about?\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "top_stories", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "title": "Michigan's top public health official to stand trial for 2 deaths connected with Flint water crisis", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/j_E8RykaKgQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:02", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) A Michigan judge issued a ruling Monday sending the criminal case of the state's Health and Human Services director to trial for the deaths of two men tied to the Flint water crisis, according to CNN affiliate WJRT-TV.\n\nThe men, who WJRT-TV identified as John Snyder and Robert Skidmore, both allegedly died of Legionnaires' disease after the city's water source was switched to the Flint River in 2014, which kicked off the water crisis.

She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap.\n\nIf she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3\u00bd-foot PVC pipe.\n\nThe day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water.\n\n\"This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nWorkman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nAs our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.\n\nAccording to the the society, about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes.\n\nFor many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see.\n\nFaucets run brown\n\nBut when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel.\n\nLocals ask themselves, \"Just what's in the water?\"\n\nUntil several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer.\n\nEastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame.\n\n'We're just scared of the water'\n\nMartin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water.\n\n\"We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years,\" she said.\n\n\"You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut,\" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. \"I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it.\"\n\nDr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. \"I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe,\" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region.\"\n\nWhere the War on Poverty began\n\nNestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate.\n\nBut poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty.\n\n\"In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine,\" said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen.\n\nWhat's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.\n\n\"I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine,\" Ormsbee said.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nA large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet.\n\nWhen water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water.\n\nAnd because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. \"As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished.\"\n\nBurns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine.\n\nBut on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that still need to be made.\n\nInvestments in hardware and software are needed\n\nFor a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income.\n\nInfrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management.\n\nSmall water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country . In addition to infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016.\n\nSome citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. \"Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries,\" Lafferty said. \"We are Americans, too.\"\n\nBall points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million, money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.\n\nSome relief\n\nRecently, Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPresident Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation, but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years.\n\nCritics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector.\n\n\"Time will tell,\" Lafferty said. \"Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories.\""}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "world", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "title": "100 years since end of WWI marked with solemn ceremonies around the world", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/9Juloer2K4w/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:03", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Solemn ceremonies took place around the world Sunday to mark 100 years to the day since the Armistice that saw the end of World War I.\n\nMembers of the public, military veterans, world leaders and royals took part in memorials around the globe to remember the 8.5 million people who gave their lives between 1914 and 1918.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron led the international Armistice Day commemorations Sunday morning by the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which lies at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris.\n\nMoroccan King Mohammed VI, US first lady Melania Trump, US President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" he said through a translator. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism.

He later visited another American cemetery, this one closer to Paris, to lay a wreath and deliver his own speech.\n\nSpeaking at Suresnes American Cemetery, Trump called out to six US veterans from World War II who were in the crowd, and a 13-year-old American boy who had saved up to attend the event.\n\nHe also paid his respects to the thousands of American soldiers who died in WWI: \"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and secure the peace they so nobly gave their lives for one century ago.\"\n\nTrump is due back in Washington by Sunday evening.\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Queen Elizabeth II and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in central London.\n\nMeanwhile, across the English Channel, royals and senior politicians gathered with veterans and members of the public at the Cenotaph in central London for Sunday's remembrance service.\n\nAt 11 a.m. the United Kingdom fell silent for two minutes to mark 100 years since the end of WWI, and to remember the approximately 900,000 Britons who gave their lives.\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex attended the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London.\n\nPrince Charles laid a wreath at the memorial on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II -- who watched on from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nCatherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen on the balcony.\n\nPrince Charles lays the Sovereign's wreath at the Cenotaph.\n\nEarlier, Australia and New Zealand were the first to mark Armistice, where crowds gathered to pay tribute to the 60,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died while serving for the British empire.\n\nThe view to Parliament House along ANZAC Parade during the Remembrance Day Service at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nIn Russia, while President Putin joined world leaders in Paris, commemoration services were being held across the country.\n\nThe Russian Empire, which had a population of around 150 million people, suffered 1.7 million deaths during the war.\n\nRussian honour guards carry wreaths marking the centenary of the Armistice Day at the Brotherly cemetery of WWI heroes in Tsarskoye Selo outside Saint Petersburg.\n\nMeanwhile, in Germany, when it comes to remembering World War I, there are far fewer memorials -- with the day being marked with muted self-reflection.

It's destroyed an estimated 6,700 buildings, most of which were homes.\n\n\u2022 Woolsey and Hill fires: Fire officials said Sunday the Woolsey Fire had spread to 83,275 acres and was 10% contained, up from 5% the night before.

Together, they're responsible for the destruction of 179 structures, but another 57,000 are threatened, according to fire officials.\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: More than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide. The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nCrews searching for the dead\n\nCrews have been combing through blackened ruins throughout the weekend.

In the chaos, some drivers abandoned their vehicles and attempted to escape on foot.\n\nWinds picking back up\n\nSaturday saw a brief reprieve in the fierce winds fueling the fires, and officials hoped to use the break to their advantage. But wind gusts on Sunday could reach as high as 30 to 50 mph, depending on elevation, officials warned.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, strong winds and low humidity, which could help the fire spread, are expected to linger from Sunday through Monday morning.\n\n\"We know tomorrow Mother Nature's gonna turn her fan back on and the winds are going to start blowing,\" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters Saturday.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California The charred remains of the burned-out home are seen in Malibu on Saturday.

The Hill Fire was at 4,500 acres.\n\nTrump tweets: President Donald Trump : President Donald Trump blamed the wildfires on the \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" in a tweet early Saturday. \"Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" he said. In another tweet sent Saturday he wrote: \"Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God bless them all.\"\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: Fire officials estimate the number of people forced from their homes statewide is more than 300,000; in Los Angeles County it is 170,000.\n\n\u2022 Containment: Firefighters are struggling to put down the flames. The Camp Fire is 20% contained, while the Woolsey Fire is just 5% contained. The Hill Fire was 25% contained.\n\n\u2022 Destruction: In Northern California, nearly 7,000 structures have been destroyed, including 80% to 90% of the homes in Paradise, north of Sacramento, according to officials. In Los Angeles and Ventura counties, a significant number of homes were destroyed or damaged, fire officials said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California The charred remains of the burned-out home are seen in Malibu on Saturday.

Among the communities hit was Paradise, a town about 80 miles north of Sacramento.\n\nFamilies raced to escape the blaze as it consumed much of the town. Footage captured by evacuees showed flames along roads, scorching trees and devouring houses.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Whitney Vaughan said after fleeing her home in Paradise . \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nThe town was mostly empty, and the main road littered with downed trees and power lines. Burnt out cars line blackened roadsides, abandoned in the panic and chaos of the evacuations.\n\n\"We do intend to rebuild,\" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said. \"It's going to be a process -- a lot of hard work, a lot of coming together.\n\n\"We want to see Paradise be Paradise again.\"\n\nAn estimated 52,000 people evacuated in Butte County, where Paradise is located.\n\nFire officials said three firefighters and some civilians were hurt, but details about their injuries were unknown. About 35 people have been reported missing, authorities said.\n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled in Ventura County and in Malibu in Los Angeles County due to the Woolsey Fire, officials said.\n\nFirefighters worked to protect thousands of students and staff sheltering in place Saturday at Pepperdine University as flames started reaching the campus overnight, school officials said.\n\nLos Angeles County firefighters are battling the Woolsey fire near Malibu.\n\nThe fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and the city of Malibu, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nIn Malibu, mandatory evacuations were ordered for the entire city of about 12,000 people that's known for its celebrity beachside homes.\n\nTwo people were arrested in looting incidents Friday during the evacuations, according to Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Eric Buschow.\n\nThe howling Santa Ana winds fueled the Woolsey Fire. These are strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area.\n\nFire officials said the winds had temporarily died down Saturday, giving them a brief opportunity to make progress.\n\n\"This is just a lull,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said, \"so we're going to take advantage of that and try to get as much line perimeter in as we can with the expectation that we will get more winds tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother round of Santa Ana winds is forecast to whip the area Sunday through Tuesday, though it may be weaker than Friday's.\n\nHill Fire\n\n\"It's been a brutal, hellish three days for the city of Thousand Oaks,\" City Councilwoman Claudia Bill-de la Pe\u00f1a said at a news conference on Saturday.\n\nA bridge paved with asphalt near Agoura Hills, California, was also heavily damaged.\n\nThe fire started Thursday and initially spread quickly, torching 10,000 acres in six hours. But firefighters have made some progress.\n\nPart of the fast-moving blaze was burning into the footprint of a 2013 wildfire, which could slow its spread, chief Lorenzen said.\n\nNo houses or businesses have been lost, but a number of RVs and outbuildings have been burned, and a firefighter suffered a minor injury, authorities said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "title": "'There wasn't anywhere to go': Wildfire destroys Paradise, California", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/2k3QuBdW3VQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:07", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) As the wildfire raged nearby, Whitney Vaughan and her husband had just enough time to grab a laundry basket of dirty clothes and some pictures before fleeing their home in Paradise, California.\n\nVaughan could hear screams and explosions nearby Thursday as she and her husband got in their car and drove away.

Four people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and and one body was discovered near the vehicles. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.\n\nThose killed in the vehicles weren't far from where Vaughan and her husband found themselves trapped.\n\nThe blaze broke out early Thursday and has grown at an astonishing rate of 80 football fields per minute . It charred 20,000 acres Thursday in less than 14 hours and has burned an area larger than Manhattan, according to CNN meteorologists.\n\nFueled by high winds and low humidity, the fire has placed millions of people under red flag warnings. Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said 80 to 90% of homes in residential neighborhoods are gone following the Camp Fire.

Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.\n\nThe fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.\n\nThe Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock.\n\n\"There's really not much left. There are very few homes still standing and we've been in multiple different neighborhoods this afternoon,\" Mayor Jody Jones said. She estimated only 10 to 20% of homes are left.\n\nFour people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and one body was discovered near the vehicles, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.\n\nTwo major fires in Southern California are just miles from the bar where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, and evacuations were ordered for nearby Malibu, a seaside city popular with celebrities.\n\nAuthorities have received reports of two fatalities in the city of Malibu, and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office said it was working to confirm whether they are related to the wildfires.\n\nFanned by high winds and fueled by low humidity and dry vegetation, the fires spread rapidly Thursday and overnight into Friday. The threat continued Friday, with millions of Californians under \"red flag\" warnings portending windy arid and warm conditions that pose extreme fire risks.\n\nHere's what we know about the trio of fires:\n\nCamp Fire: People flee 'carrying their babies and kids'\n\nIn Northern California, panicked residents began fleeing Paradise on Thursday as the Camp Fire swept through it.\n\nBy Friday morning, the town's main road was littered with downed trees and power lines. Much of the brush and grasses were blackened along the valleys, and many trees were still burning, a CNN crew there observed.\n\nA family that evacuated Thursday by driving along flame-lined roads posted a startling video to Facebook. The recording shows fire claiming houses and trees, and sparks blowing across the road in front of them. Suddenly the vehicle breaks through a wall of smoke and emerges into the safety of a clear road.\n\nJones, the mayor, said a good portion of the business district is gone. And while some trees were torched, Jones said most of them remain.\n\n\"One of the things that's beautiful about Paradise are the trees and they're still here. ... I wasn't expecting that, but it's a good thing,\" Jones said.\n\nAt least 52,000 residents were forced to evacuate from Butte County as the fire burned 90,000 acres.\n\nFlames also were on the outer edges of Chico, a city of 93,000 people about a 90-mile drive north of Sacramento.\n\nThe full extent of the destruction in the county was still unknown, but authorities said more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed -- many of those in Paradise.\n\nWhitney Vaughan described a scene of panic and terror as she recalled her narrow escape from her Paradise home Thursday morning.\n\nVaughan and her husband had just fled their home as flames rushed them. She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThey drove away but got eventually got caught in traffic. Flames were feet away, smoke was thick, cars weren't moving and people were panicking. Some people left their cars there \"and took off running, carrying their babies and kids.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook. She and her husband eventually were able to drive away safely.\n\n\"We thought the fire was going to kill us,\" she told CNN.\n\nParadise, roughly 80 miles north of Sacramento, is where four people were found dead in different vehicles and one person was found dead near a vehicle on the road where Vaughn recorded her video. The other four deceased victims were also found in the Paradise area.\n\nFive people had to be rescued by helicopter from the fire according to Josh Bischof, Riverside Fire Battalion Chief. The rescues were performed by firefighters who were actively engaged in fire-fighting, Bischof said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California The charred remains of the burned-out home are seen in Malibu on Saturday.

It's been fueled by Trump himself, who has proudly identified himself as a nationalist as he advances an \"America First\" agenda.\n\nIn his address, French President Emmanuel Macron -- who has emerged as Europe's most vocal sentry against a global tide of nationalism -- repeated his warnings.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" he said through a translator. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\n\"I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death,\" he said. \"History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"\n\nIt was impossible to view his remarks as anything less than a rebuke of Trump, who has proudly espoused an \"America First\" foreign policy. Speaking later at an American cemetery in Paris, Trump did not directly respond, choosing instead to stick to a brief speech honoring the war dead.\n\n\"Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior -- great, great warriors they are -- who gave everything for family, country, God and freedom,\" Trump said in the 10-minute speech, which was the centerpiece of his visit to Paris for the armistice centenary.\n\nTrump arrived separately from other foreign leaders to Sunday's armistice centenary ceremonies, which occurred under gray skies and cold drizzle. His counterparts, including Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, convened at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace before traveling together in motor coaches to the Arc de Triomphe. They walked in a large group to the event site under black umbrellas.\n\nInstead, Trump pulled up in his own vehicle and walked in separately, due to \"security protocols,\" according to the White House. A topless protester breached a police barricade and ran toward Trump's motorcade before being apprehended. Russian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and walked in solo, flashing Trump a brief thumbs-up as he took his place among the leaders.\n\nThe ceremony in Paris was the largest of events across Europe and in the United States commemorating the armistice . Queen Elizabeth II led members of the royal family -- including William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- at the Cenotaph in central London for a solemn ceremony.\n\nIn Washington, the role traditionally played by the President at Arlington National Cemetery was assumed this year by Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie who placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\nThe armistice that took effect at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 ended what was then the war meant to end all wars. When conflict broke out on the continent two decades later, the United States was again pulled into bloody battle, cementing its role in maintaining European security.\n\nVisiting Paris this week, Trump has bemoaned the cost to the US of helping maintain European security, insisting countries here do more to protect themselves. The cost of securing Europe is a reliable b\u00eate noire for Trump, one he's railed against on the campaign trail and in meetings with his counterparts.\n\nHis actions have raised questions about the state of longstanding US relationships.\n\nThe man who was once his top European partner, Macron, now appears to have become just another world leader subject to ill-timed insults and jabs. Trump's other counterparts -- British Prime Minister Theresa May and Germany's Merkel -- have also been subject to ridicule.\n\nTrump did not appear overly eager on Saturday to dispel the notion he is uninterested in bettering US-Europe ties. During a morning meeting with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored the two men's relationship were gone, replaced by wooden expressions of cooperation.\n\nLater, the President canceled a planned visit to an American cemetery 50 miles outside of Paris. The White House cited the rain, which sometimes grounds the President's Marine One helicopter.\n\nHe remained out of view for most of the afternoon, even as fellow leaders -- including Macron, May, Merkel and Trudeau -- fanned out across the French countryside to mark the solemn anniversary at hallowed locations along the former Western Front.\n\nOn Sunday, the President to make up for the cancellation, which drew criticism and accusations he was ignoring the sacrifice of American military personnel who died in World War I.\n\nFollowing the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe -- which featured a review of troops, musical performances and Macron's address -- Trump attended a lunch for all the world leaders.\n\nAfterward he traveled the short distance to Suresnes American Cemetery, perched on Mont Val\u00e9rien with a panoramic view of the French capital.\n\n\"Through rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and more, they held the line and pushed onward to victory,\" Trump said of the soldiers who died for the allied cause a century ago. \"A great, great victory. A costly victory but a great victory.\"\n\nTrump was due back in Washington by Sunday evening.\n\nThe visit to Paris came about after Trump scrubbed plans for a military parade in Washington, deeming the $90 million price tag too steep . He originally devised the parade having been inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in Paris last year, which featured tanks, troops in formation and aircraft flyovers.\n\nSunday's ceremony occurred in the same vicinity but wasn't be as overly militaristic; it was intended to commemorate the end of war and not the practice of it."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Trump in Paris", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/oB7m2JrqtXk/2PPnsC5", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:09", "body_paragraphs": "Trump speaking at Suresnes American Cemetery.

His disapproval rating was 54%.\n\nThis was in line with pre-election polling pegging his approval rating in the mid-40s among voters.\n\nWhat's the point: It turns out that Trump does not walk on political water. He does not defy political gravity. This is very bad news for him heading into the 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump was elected President with the worst favorable rating ever. This led many to speculate that traditional measures of gauging a politician's popularity had been rendered obsolete by him.\n\nSuch a view ignored a key factor of the 2016 campaign: Hillary Clinton. Clinton was the second least liked major-party nominee of all time. Nearly 20% of 2016 voters held unfavorable views of Clinton and Trump. Among these voters, Trump won overwhelmingly. That is, he was seen as the lesser of two evils.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections were the key test over whether the Republican Party could do well with an unpopular Trump and without an unpopular Clinton in the political arena. The answer was a resounding no.\n\nHouse Republicans' projected national House margin (-7 points) matched Trump's net approval rating in the exit polls (-9 points) nearly perfectly.\n\nIndeed, as I pointed out on Wednesday, the exit polls showed that voter choices this election were more highly correlated this midterm than in any midterm dating back to the first time the exit poll asked about the president's approval rating.\n\nThere has also been a question as to whether there is hidden Trump support not picked up by the polling. There wasn't on Tuesday.\n\nThe President's approval rating in the exit polls matched those of the pre-election polls of voters. At least nationally, there were no shy Trump voters. This would help to explain why the national congressional generic ballot average before the election predicted the national House vote well.\n\nThe good news for Trump is that the pre-election polls among adults that had his approval rating in the low 40s did not come to fruition in the exit polls. That's not surprising given that the voting population tends to be older and less diverse than the adult population at large.\n\nStill, a 45% approval rating is not very good. As the 2018 midterms showed, it would probably lead to his defeat in 2020.\n\nOf course, we're still two years away from that election. The President's approval rating could climb higher over the next two years. If it gets to 50%, for example, he'd be a favorite for re-election.\n\nThe bad news for Trump is that unlike presidents before him, he's never hit 50% approval among voters. In fact, with the exception of the honeymoon period immediately following his inauguration, Trump's approval rating has always been below his disapproval rating.\n\nThe best word to describe his support among the electorate is \"consistent.\" He earned 46% of the national vote in 2016 and a 45% approval rating on election night 2018.\n\nUnless the Democratic Party nominates someone as disliked as Clinton in 2020, an unpopular Trump won't be able to count on enough voters going with a third party candidate to allow him to sneak by in the Electoral College.\n\nThat's probably why Trump starts off the 2020 campaign as an underdog."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "Florida county collects uncounted ballots left in a mail facility", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/IYrlLKqulWY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) The elections board in Florida's Miami-Dade County has collected a set of mysterious ballots in the Opa-locka mail facility after Democrats raised concern about the uncounted votes.\n\nThe uncounted ballots have emerged as one of many battles over the fiercely contested Florida elections that moved this weekend into a recount phase.\n\nSuzy Trutie, a spokesperson for the county's supervisor of elections, told CNN there were 266 ballots in the shipment and that the votes will not be counted. Florida law requires all ballots sent by mail to arrive at the election facility by 7 p.m. on Election Day, and these ballots did not meet that standard, Trutie said.\n\nThe US Postal Service said in a statement on Friday that it was operating in \"close coordination and partnerships with election officials at the local, county and state levels.\" But as of Sunday morning, it still did not confirm ballots had not been provided in time to local election officials.\n\nBy law, all ballots for federal races must be kept by an elections board for up to 22 months after the election, which means the ballots will not be destroyed and could theoretically be brought into a potential court case.\n\nRead More"}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "politics", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "title": "It is impossible to ignore the defection of women voters away from the GOP", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/YnHTOCfXVeg/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Almost every subgroup of women in CNN's national exit polls moved towards the Democratic Party, including white women, Latinas, white college-educated women, white non-college-educated women, Democratic women and independent women. The only groups that are inconclusive or stayed the same on a national level were African-American women and Republican women.\n\nThis is the first time since 1984 that Democrats have won control of the House without winning men, and the largest margin for Democrats among women in exit polling history (which dates back to 1976 for the House).\n\nAll election cycle, journalists and pollsters alike have noted how pronounced the gender gap has become on the generic ballot. Days before the election, 62% of women likely voters nationally said in a CNN poll conducted by SSRS that they'd support the Democratic candidate compared to only 48% of men who said the same. Exit polls suggest the final vote will largely mirror that result, with 59% of women saying they supported the Democrat compared to 47% of men.\n\nWhile women have been steadily moving towards Democratic candidates, men have remained more the same, nationally. They did vote more Democratic in 2018 than in 2016, but around the same as they voted in 2012. Men may have moved towards Democrats in this election, but not in any amount we haven't seen before.\n\nWhite women have been getting more Democratic both on the national level and in most states polled since 2012 -- that includes Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Texas and West Virginia. In the 2012 presidential election, 56% of white women voted for the Republican Party nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 14 percentage points more than voted for President Barack Obama, according to CNN exit polls that year. In 2014, the same margin voted for a Democratic House candidate in the midterms. In 2016, 55% of white women voted for a Republican in the House election, a 12-point lead over Democrats.\n\nIn 2018, the same percentage of white women voted for a Democrat as voted Republican -- 49%. That's a drop from a 14-point lead for Republicans in 2012 to a net even currently among white women. This trend towards Democratic candidates among white women also occurred in key states where Democrats did not win statewide races on Election Day, like Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia. Several races, including Senate races in Arizona and Florida remain in question. As of this writing, the Democrat leads in Arizona and the Republican leads in Florida.\n\nWhite women still voted for the Republican more than for the Democrat in many key states, but less so than in recent elections. In Texas, 71% of white women voted for Republican John Cornyn over Democrat David Alameel for Senate in 2014 (a 44 percentage point difference). In 2016, more white women voted for President Donald Trump than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 37 percentage points.\n\nIn Texas' 2018 exit poll, 60% of white women voted for Republican incumbent Ted Cruz, only 21 percentage points more than voted for Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke. Though that is still a big Republican advantage, it has certainly shrunk -- from a 44-point lead in 2014 for Republicans to a 21-point lead in 2018.\n\nWhite men also voted slightly more Democratic than usual in 2018. But while white women went from 56% support for the GOP in 2014 to to 49% support for the GOP in 2018, white men shifted only four percentage points, from 64% in favor of the Republican candidate in 2014 to 60% support for the Republican candidate this year.\n\nWhite college-educated women, a more specific subgroup, have moved even more Democratic in every key battleground state polled (including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Texas) and nationally since 2014. In 2014, white college-educated women voted for the Republican candidate by four percentage points more than the Democratic candidate, and in 2016, they supported both candidates equally. But in 2018, 59% of white college-educated women voted for a Democratic candidate in the House, 20-points more than voted for the Republican.\n\nThe only state in which white women didn't stay the same or become more Democratic was Georgia, where white women have been moving towards Republicans since 2014 -- voting for Republican Nathan Deal by 41 percentage points over Democrat Jason Carter in the gubernatorial election. In the 2018 exit polls, 75% of white women voted for Republican Brian Kemp, 50 percentage points more than voted for Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nIn Georgia exit polls, 97% of African-American women voted for Abrams, a sizable increase from both the 2014 gubernatorial election in Georgia and the 2016 presidential election. In 2014, African-American women voted for the Democratic candidate for governor at 89% and 10% for the Republican candidate -- a 79-point advantage for Democrats. In 2018, among African-American women, Abrams, who would be the nation's first African-American woman governor, had a 95-point advantage.\n\nIndependent women is another subgroup in Georgia that has moved toward Democrats; they supported the Republican Deal in 2014 by 10 percentage points more than Carter compared to breaking for for Stacey Abrams at 53%, eight points more than voted for Kemp.\n\nNationally and in every key race state polled except Texas and Arizona, independent women have been moving towards Democrats (Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada). In 2012, when Democrat Charlie Crist and Republican Rick Scott were running against each other for Florida governor, independent women supported Crist by only two percentage points. In 2016, the Democratic advantage moved to seven points in the presidential race between Clinton and Trump. In 2018, 59% of independent women voted for Democrat Bill Nelson, 20 points more than those who voted for Republican Rick Scott. Scott leads in the race, but it appears to be headed for a recount.\n\nNationally, independent men are one of the few groups of men that appear to be moving more Democratic. Independent men voted Republican by 19 percentage points more than Democratic in 2014 and 12 points more in 2016. In 2018, independent men voted for the Democrat over the Republican by seven points, a 26 percentage point shift from 2014 to 2018 -- even larger than the 21 percentage point shift in that period among independent women.\n\nDemocratic women, most of whom voted with the base to begin with, did so slightly more nationally, and in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada in 2018 than they did in 2016. Republican women haven't moved much in almost all states, except for Florida. In Florida, Republican women have moved ever-so-slightly towards the Democrats since 2014.\n\nWhat explains this shift is very much up for debate. There are likely many factors at play, possibly including the MeToo movement, Trump's combative rhetoric and the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is undeniable that a shift of women toward Democrats helped elect more women than ever before to Congress this year. Eighty-one percent of women who voted in 2018 said that it's important to elect more women to public office, even higher among women who voted for a Democratic candidate for the House (97%).\n\nWomen were also much more likely than men to use their vote for Congress to oppose Trump -- 43% of women said so compared to 31% of men. Trump isn't on the ballot this year, but many Americans still said their vote was in opposition or support of the President, and it was clearly of more importance to women than men.\n\nAnother big factor in women's vote was sexual harassment. Eight-seven percent of women said sexual harassment is an important problem in our country today while slightly fewer (80%) of men said the same."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "For 10 years, a chemical not EPA approved was in their drinking water", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/4abhx7GxYMA/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:10", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) For 10 years, some residents in Denmark, South Carolina, have been suspicious of the rust-colored water coming from their taps.

The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 44 homes and six other locations and found lead levels were at the legal limit. It wasn't enough to sound alarm bells.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Jury delivers $25.5 million 'statement' to Aetna to change its ways", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/7keMng2BA8g/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) An Oklahoma jury has awarded $25.5 million to the family of a cancer patient denied coverage by Aetna, with jurors saying that the insurer acted \"recklessly\" and that the verdict was meant as a message for Aetna to change its ways.\n\nThe award is believed to be the largest verdict in an individual \"bad faith\" insurance case in Oklahoma history, one court observer said, and could have major ramifications across the country for a form of cancer treatment called proton beam therapy.\n\nThe case revolved around the 2014 denial of coverage for Orrana Cunningham, who had stage 4 nasopharyngeal cancer near her brain stem. Her doctors wanted her to receive proton beam therapy, a targeted form of radiation that could pinpoint her tumor without the potential for blindness or other side effects of standard radiation.\n\nAetna denied her coverage, calling the therapy investigational and experimental.\n\nOrrana and her husband, Ron Cunningham, a retired Oklahoma City firefighter, had been together since 1987. He was determined to do whatever it took to get the love of his life the treatment she needed. The couple mortgaged their dream home and set up a GoFundMe page to help pay the $92,082.19 to get the therapy her doctors had prescribed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas.\n\nHowever, Orrana died May 30, 2015, at the age of 54, in part from a viral infection that reached her brain.\n\nRon Cunningham said this week's verdict was vindication for the suffering his wife went through. She had filed the initial paperwork to sue Aetna, saying that if her case helped save the life of one person, it would be worth it.\n\n\"My wife started the case, and I'm just finishing the fight,\" he said. \"We did her proud. My wife wanted to make sure that it got out. Her comment was 'if we could just save one person.'\n\n\"As far as the money, I'd give it all back to spend just one more day with her.\"\n\nAetna attorney John Shely said in closing arguments that the insurance giant was proud of the three medical directors who denied coverage, even turning to thank them as they sat in the front row of the courtroom, according to jurors and other witnesses in court.\n\nIt was a message that didn't sit well with the 12 jurors, who found that Aetna \"recklessly disregarded its duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with the Cunninghams.\"\n\n\"I just felt like Orrana Cunningham was failed at every turn,\" forewoman Ann Schlotthauer said.\n\nShe said the verdict \"was definitely a message to Aetna. We discussed that in jury deliberations -- that we wanted to make a statement. We wanted to make a point and get their attention.\"\n\n'Aetna needed to pay'\n\nSchlotthauer said it was clear from expert testimony that proton beam therapy was not experimental at all. She said jurors were turned off by one Aetna medical director who acknowledged handling 80 cases a day and by the fact that all three medical directors acknowledged they spent more time preparing for the lawsuit than on Orrana's medical case.\n\nSchlotthauer said she believed that Aetna's medical directors \"rubber-stamped\" the denials without doing their due diligence. \"No one was looking at her specific case,\" she said. \"That's where we decided that obviously they were in breach of contract and should've paid for that treatment. It was medically necessary in her situation.\n\n\"I hope [the verdict] does result in huge changes,\" she said. \"I hope it results in Aetna re-evaluating how they evaluate appeals and requests.\"\n\nJuror Ora Dale cried and hugged Cunningham after the trial. She was one of two jurors who believed the monetary award should've been much higher than the $25.5 million handed down.\n\n\"I just wanted to let him know that I was on his side,\" Dale said. \"Those medical directors did not exhaust every measure like they said that they did. They did not spend enough time on her claim. It just kept getting denied and denied.\n\n\"Aetna needed to pay. They were in the wrong, and he deserved everything that he was asking for.\"\n\nCunningham had another encounter in court. He said Shely, Aetna's lead attorney, walked up to him and congratulated him after the verdict before telling him he'd lose on appeals.\n\nCunningham was an Oklahoma City firefighter when the Alfred P. Murrah building was bombed on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and wounding hundreds more in one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. The day after the bombing, he was assigned to comb through the wreckage of the day-care center on the second floor to search for bodies of children. He said he would spray corpses with Lysol to prevent the spread of bacteria.\n\nHe'd seen the worst of the worst. But little could've prepared him for that encounter with Aetna's attorney in the courtroom. He said he stood, stunned, trying to grasp what he'd just heard.\n\n\"That showed how callous these people are,\" he said.\n\nShely did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurer, declined to comment on the encounter but maintained that it acted appropriately in denying coverage in this case, saying there is a \"lack of clinical data supporting proton therapy for treating nasopharyngeal tumors.\"\n\n\"While we have no comment on the ruling, juror motives or a potential appeal, we do want to make it clear that the proper steps under the health plan were followed in this instance,\" Aetna said in a written statement. \"As our chief medical officer noted in a post earlier this year, it's never easy to tell an individual or family that a treatment or procedure is not approved -- it's the hardest thing we have to do.\n\n\"However, our guiding principles will continue to be proven effectiveness and member safety, as determined by rigorous scientific studies.\"\n\nDoug Terry, the lead attorney for the Cunninghams, offered a much different take.\n\n\"We believe this case pulled the curtain back on what goes on at a health insurance company when claims are being denied,\" Terry said. \"The jury's verdict delivered the message that the public will not stand for insurance companies putting profits before policyholders.\"\n\nDefense attorney: Aetna did 'nothing wrong'\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with cancer to be denied proton beam therapy by insurers, despite the recommendations of their treating physicians. Many radiation oncologists express frustrations about the denials, and websites exist offering tips and recommendations on how to try to get insurance companies to pay for coverage of proton therapy.\n\nOther cancer patients often turn to sites like GoFundMe to raise money for their treatment. Some insurers eventually agree to cover therapy for adult patients after a lengthy appeals process.\n\nRon Cunningham said that his wife was his \"rock\" and that the verdict was justice.\n\nDaniel E. Smith, executive director of the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access , applauded the verdict and called on insurance commissioners in all 50 states to make sure the treatment will now be covered by insurance companies when treating doctors believe that it is the best available treatment for their patients.\n\n\"We applaud Ron Cunningham for standing up to Aetna, and the jury for recognizing and holding Aetna to account for their broken system,\" Smith said in a statement. \"We've seen a similar pattern of betrayal across the industry, where insurers use outdated information and medical staff with little knowledge of proton therapy to ultimately deny as many as four in 10 patients seeking the treatment. It's past time to hold insurers accountable.\"\n\nSome jurors said that one of the most convincing experts was radiation oncologist Dr. Andrew L. Chang, who explained why proton beam therapy was the best treatment for Orrana Cunningham. He was not involved in her care but was called as an independent expert by her attorneys.\n\n\"The thing I tried to illustrate to the jury is that proton therapy is not a new, experimental technique, like Aetna wants to claim,\" Chang said. \"Proton therapy is a well-established treatment for cancer and has been for decades. ... Nobody in the oncology community considers proton therapy experimental for the treatment of cancer.\"\n\nHe said he told jurors that Medicare covers proton treatment and that insurance companies often cover it for an array of cancers for pediatric patients, typically up to the age of 21.\n\n\"One thing we pointed out is that as much as Aetna and these other insurance companies like to say proton therapy is experimental, they always put a caveat in there that it's not experimental for pediatric patients,\" Chang said. \"We pointed out Medicare pays for it for 65 years or older. So, what is it about 22-year-olds to 64-year-olds that makes proton therapy experimental? There is no good answer for that; insurance companies call it that because they decided to deem it as such.\"\n\nTwo top cancer specialists, not affiliated with the trial, told CNN they agreed with Chang's assessment.\n\nIn Orrana's case, Chang said, the tumor was right next to her brain stem and optic nerve, and it had been growing up toward the base of her skull. He said he told jurors that standard radiation could've been used, as Aetna wanted, but the \"risks were severe.\"\n\n\"She would go blind. She would lose a significant portion of her memory on the left side of her brain and still not have a very good chance at a cure,\" Chang said. \"For her particular tumor, [proton therapy] was extremely valuable.\"\n\nBefore Orrana died, he said, scans showed that the tumor was shrinking and the treatment was working.\n\nAetna attorney Shely told jurors that this was a case \"of misplaced blame by Mr. Cunningham and his lawyers,\" according to the official court transcript.\n\n\"Aetna has full confidence in your ability to hear the evidence from that witness stand and then later compare it to the opening statement you just heard,\" Shely said during his opening statement. \"In short, the evidence that you will see and hear will convince you that Aetna has done nothing wrong, nothing.\"\n\nAfter considering the evidence, the jury did, in fact, find fault with Aetna's handling of the case, voting on Monday to award $15.5 million in emotional distress damages and on Tuesday tacking on $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nKent McGuire, a personal injury attorney in Oklahoma who watched parts of the trial, called the verdict the biggest bad faith insurance verdict for an individual case in Oklahoma history. \"It was certainly a stunning verdict to award that much money, and it was a message, too,\" he said.\n\nRon Cunningham said his wife would be pleased with the verdict.\n\nShe used to comfort him on hard days -- whether it was in the months after the 1995 bombing or after he'd find a child badly injured in a house fire. He'd come home, place his head in her lap and tell her everything on his mind.\n\n\"She was a rock for me, especially through my bad times,\" he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe past two weeks at trial, he said, were especially hard because it brought back so many memories. Of his own battle with cancer in 1998, when she stuck by his side. Of washing her body as she weakened from cancer. Of simply missing the gal who stole his heart four decades ago.\n\nOrrana was known to take in stray animals. Cats, dogs, you name it. Ron would tell her he was the biggest stray she ever took in. He laughed while recalling that moment.\n\nHe then talked about the three Aetna medical directors; he said each testified that \"they wouldn't change anything they did.\"\n\nWhen the jury said Aetna \"recklessly disregarded\" Orrana's case, Ron Cunningham said, he finally felt justice.\n\n\"When they said that, it was like, 'I think we did her proud,' \" he said."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "FDA plans to launch new restrictions on e-cigarette flavors", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/sautk1x1bCQ/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:11", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Taking on epidemic levels of teen e-cigarette use, the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce new restrictions on the sale of e-cigarette products an agency official confirmed Thursday.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as next week.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked."}, {"site": "cnn", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss", "title": "Doctors share gun stories, demand action after NRA tells them to 'stay in their lane'", "article_link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_health/~3/DpMBghpNdxY/index.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:12", "body_paragraphs": "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

The medical association has long maintained that firearm-related deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis.\n\nThe recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety.\n\nThe argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic , known as SAFE, are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement \"evidence-based policy\" on guns.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments.\n\n\"The so-called 'uproar' on twitter or what could [be] characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet. It's clear form the comments that they didn't read the article,\" Jennifer Baker wrote in an email. \"It's just another example of gun control advocates with the help of the mainstream media blaming law abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of deranged people and exploiting tragedy to push a gun control agenda that would not prevent these crimes. The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent [last night's] tragedy.\"\n\nBaker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided.\n\nIf medical organizations \"would like to concentrate on a public health crisis,\" she wrote, \"they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly 50,000 suicides per year, the medical community's complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over 42,000 lives per year or the 250,000 deaths due to medical errors.\"\n\nFew NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors, nurses and others.\n\nBut some stepped onto the field, like @wickedgrin1, who said, \"This is a crime issue, not a public health issue. Doctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue, to be corrected by government interference in private lives. This is the opposite of what medicine should be, and there is not end to it.\"\n\nThis is a crime issue, not a public health issue.\n\n\n\nDoctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue, to be corrected by government interference in private lives.\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite of what medicine should be, and there is not end to it. \u2014 Wicked Grin (@wickedgrin1) November 8, 2018\n\nAnd there won't be an end to it until doctors are satisfied, said Bob Doherty, an official with the American College of Physicians.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Here's a link to the @AnnalsofIM paper we wrote that has the @NRA demanding that doctors not speak out on gun violence,\" he tweeted. \"Doctors will keep speaking out.

My Mum thought it was down to my hectic student lifestyle.\"\n\nA visit to her GP and two blood tests for iron levels revealed that she was suffering from genetic haemochromatosis or GH - a genetic condition which causes iron to overload in the body.\n\nMost of us think of iron as a strength-giver and worry more about iron deficiency.

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/health/rss.xml", "title": "NHS outpatients service 'stuck in the 18th Century'", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46142276", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:53", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year\n\nThe way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck \"in the 18th Century\", leading doctors say.\n\nEvery year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care.\n\nThe Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled.\n\nIt said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money.\n\nThe RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations.\n\nGetting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help.\n\nIt said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done.\n\nDr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: \"It's an 18th Century system.

I put my hands to my head and I was drenched in sweat. I knew straight away it was a heart attack,\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\nShe was a healthy 38-year-old when she had a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), a rare and often undiagnosed condition.\n\nIt is the leading cause of heart attacks in women of childbearing age, affecting around 1,000 women a year.\n\nIt occurs when there is a sudden tear in one of the coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart.\n\nIn hospital, Hayley, from Congleton in Cheshire, feared the worst.\n\n\"I can remember saying to them, 'am I dying?' And they just kept saying, 'we've tried everything we can, but nothing is working,'\" she said.\n\n'I felt less of a woman'\n\nShe survived, but like many women with SCAD, was told pregnancy would mean the risk of another heart attack.\n\n\"I think it was another thing that was stolen from me, so I almost don't allow myself to think about it, because it could take you down a dark path of sadness,\" Hayley reflected.\n\n\"I felt less of a person, less of a woman, more of a failure, like I was faulty.\"\n\nWhat is SCAD?\n\nSpontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an under-diagnosed heart condition\n\nIt affects mainly women, occasionally during - or soon after - pregnancy\n\nMenopause, extreme stress and exercise have also been associated with it\n\nDuring an attack, a sudden tear or bruise develops in one of the coronary arteries blocking the blood follow\n\nIt can cause death, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and require heart bypass surgery\n\nSource: Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit\n\nPatient's decision\n\nHayley is the kind of woman who consultant cardiologist Dr Abi Al-Hussaini is trying to help, with her clinic at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.\n\nImage caption Dr Al-Hussaini aims to allow women to make an informed decision on whether to have a baby.\n\nDr Al-Hussaini assesses the damage done to the heart by the SCAD and reviews the patient's medication, generally lowering the amount they are on.\n\nShe uses that information to advise the patient how risky a pregnancy could be.\n\nThis does mean sometimes she has to advise that the risk to health might be very high, but the key is the patient makes the decision, rather than the usual blanket advice not to get pregnant.\n\nIf one of her patients decides to proceed, they are referred to the pre-existing \"high risk pregnancy team\" at the hospital, who monitor them throughout the pregnancy.\n\n\"I have seen a lot of patients over the last few years who have come to me unhappy that they have been told they cannot have a child ever again,\" she explained.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons I established the clinic, to give these patients the correct advice and allow them to make an informed decision themselves.\"\n\nShe believes a lack of research into the condition is why most cardiologists prefer the blanket advice.\n\nSharp pain\n\nOne of the first women helped by the clinic was Julie Murphy, 40, from Ruislip.\n\nImage caption Julie Murphy and Holly play with baby Bella, who was born in April\n\nShortly before her honeymoon in 2013, she started to feel unwell, like she had flu. While on holiday in Kenya, the symptoms got worse.\n\nThen, while swimming, she had a sharp pain in her chest. When she got home, she had tests on her heart and, \"the next day I found out I'd had a heart attack\".\n\nThe days and weeks that followed were very tough.\n\n\"All the medication I was on really slowed me down so I couldn't even walk up the stairs when I came home from hospital. That was really difficult to get my head around,\" she says.\n\nLike Hayley, Julie was initially told she would not be able to have children. But she became part of a research project led by Dr Al-Hussaini and had her first daughter, Holly, in 2015.\n\n'Awesome team'\n\nShe then became one of the clinic's first patients when she became pregnant for a second time.\n\n\"I was worried that they would say there's no possibility or it would be too dangerous for us to try to have a baby, that it might mean that I'm putting my life at risk,\" she said.\n\nBella was born in April.\n\n\"They're such an awesome team that you felt so looked after,\" Julie said.\n\nDespite the hope she is giving patients, Dr Al-Hussaini says she has encountered resistance from doctors around the world, in terms of what advice they give their patients.\n\n\"In America, they are against becoming pregnant any time after a heart attack, or having had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection,\" she said.\n\n\"But again, I think that's because there hasn't been a huge amount of research - but there is a growing amount of research at the moment that's been developed.\"\n\nFollow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "The 'painted wolves' of Zimbabwe", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46141876", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:00:58", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright \u00a9Nicholas Dyer Image caption Staring competition: Painted wolves, or African wild dogs, do everything as a group - even facing up to a hyena\n\nThey are stunning; there's no question.

More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.\n\nThe European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"site": "bbc", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml", "title": "Antarctic: Nasa shares close-up photos of big PIG iceberg", "article_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46153327", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:04", "body_paragraphs": "Image copyright NASA ICEBRIDGE/Brooke Medley Image caption Icebergs calve from the front of glaciers that terminate in the sea\n\nScientists this week got their first close-up look at the big new iceberg that's calved from Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Antarctic.\n\nThe block, which has the designation B-46, initially covered 225 sq km.\n\nGiven the fashion in recent years to compare such bergs with the area of Manhattan Island, that would have made this one roughly three times the size of the famous district in New York.\n\nBut the Nasa over-flight on Wednesday shows the berg is already breaking up.\n\nThe US space agency DC-8 was on a routine expedition as part of the IceBridge project, which measures the elevation of ice surfaces with a laser.\n\nResearchers onboard were able to point their cameras out the windows of the aircraft and capture some of the scale and beauty of the frozen scene below.\n\nThe PIG drains a vast area of west Antarctica that is roughly equivalent to two-thirds the area of the UK.

Farid Behbud\n\nKABUL, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Fed up with low-quality medication in their country, a rough number of Afghan people are still staying close enough to always use traditional medication, wherever available at the center and provinces.\n\nThe initiative to legalize an effective traditional medicine, if practiced, would promote a formal, legal and scientific traditional medication within the country's health sector to cure hundreds of people suffering physical and mental ailment, or diseases which are too hard to be healed by modern medicines.\n\nDuring one of his few days stay in China, an Afghan head of Mora Hospital, Dr. Azizullah Amir, was inspired by a real physical therapy of some special Chinese traditional medicines as suggested by many of his visited museums and drug-stores prescribing legal, official and scientific medicines produced from various types of herbs and plants.\n\n\"We want to do something new, especially in Afghanistan, in partnership with the Chinese traditional medicine practitioners to promote Chinese Traditional Medicine (CTM) in Afghanistan,\" Amir, founder and chief of Mora Hospital, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that he was fully determined to do that.\n\nThough it is still a theory, Amir was confident that he could put it into practice in his country, rich with medicinal herbs, in a partnership with Chinese experts interested in investment to development the folk remedy.\n\nIt is possible to reach the goal, as people have once been familiar with such a remedy, in the course of history, when there were no modern hospitals or the current up-to-date medicines, but how could soon develop and replace it with the once badly and illegally used such method in the name of Tababat-e-Unani or Greek Medication, in a country, with people of lower information about which one could alleviate their pains.\n\n\"It is very easy, we want to invest in this field in cooperation with Chinese specialists, work in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, import the needed laboratories from China first, and then launch awareness programs among the people to refrain from using poor so-called herbal medicines, illegally sold along the streets and some other stores,\" said Amir who hoped he would reach the target.\n\nWhile visiting China, the Afghan physician said he had also heard from the Chinese people about how pharmacies in their country produced high-quality medicinal herbs, how the traditional remedy could prove with higher effective and lower side-effects and how traditional practitioners could cure people with physical and mental conditions through acupuncture and physiotherapy systems.\n\nAmir has found that Chinese people have their own initiated medicinal technique, so he wanted to establish the traditional healing (Chinese Traditional Medicine) as a new health department of his hospital.\n\n\"I decided to have the initiation in my own country to help my compatriots with economic problem access the low-priced therapy, through herbal,\" Amir said, adding that his hospital was a scientific and educational entity planned to offer better and quality services for the people.\n\nAs in Afghanistan, most patients complain about some harmful side-effects which the modern medication may cause after and during treatment, the traditional medicines are likely to have the lowermost side-effects.\n\n\"There was a big different between the two curing methods; Chinese Traditional Medication can produce medicines and pills from certain herbs and plants, with lowest side-effects, while the modern therapy is not empty of higher side-effects,\" said Amir.\n\nConsidering the date-expired medicines being vended everywhere in the capital and some Afghan big cities, and lack of the people awareness about the harms, there was a need to take enough time to divert attention of the people from out-of-date medicines and help them get full familiarity with a real, scientific and legal healing system; either traditional or modern methods.\n\nThe mountainous Afghanistan is rich with medicinal herbs as excluding the illicit export trade of opium, principal legal exports from the Afghanistan were carpets and rugs, dried fruits, precious stones as well as medicinal plants.\n\nTraditional medicine or indigenous medicine comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, with the Mora Hospital chief saying it could easily be possible through physiotherapy and acupuncture system.\n\nAcupuncture is a method of complementary medicine involving pricking of the skin or tissues with needles.\n\nSome 9 percent of Afghans had access to health care during the Taliban regime, which was ousted in late 2001, but the number increased to 67 percent in 2016.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Mora Hospital is the first-ever health, scientific and educational center, dedicated for women, comprising various sections, including general medical, pharmacy, nursing, laboratory, mental health and dental and physiotherapy services. It also includes nursery, high school and university equipped with dormitory.\n\nThe center, which is located in Afshar, western part of Kabul, has over 1,000 students."}, {"site": "xinhua", "category": "health", "feed_link": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/rss/healthrss.xml", "title": "<a href='http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm' target='_blank'>China Focus: Separate exam sites for HIV students spark controversy</a>", "article_link": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-06/02/c_136335473.htm", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:21", "body_paragraphs": "Source: Xinhua| 2017-06-02 20:06:31|Editor: Xiang Bo\n\nVideo Player Close\n\nTAIYUAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A special school for HIV students has caused controversy by arranging for 16 of its students to take the gaokao exam in separate classrooms from non-HIV students.\n\nThe 16 students -- 11 boys and five girls -- will sit the gaokao, China's college entrance exam, on June 6-7 in two classroom-turned exam rooms at Linfen Red Ribbon School in northern China's Shanxi Province, the country's only school for HIV children.\n\nThe students, aged 17 to 21, are the first group of high middle school graduates from the school, previously called \"A Tiny Classroom of Love,\" opened by Linfen Third People's Hospital for medical staff to teach four HIV children.

If I say coal use in the United States dropped by 20 percent in the last two years, slashing carbon dioxide emissions and future climate change, many people would yawn.\"\n\nHowever, he noted, \"If I say the same drop in coal use will save 3,000 American lives this year by reducing air pollution, people notice. Both things are true.\"\n\nWhile global warming and climate change are agreed upon by the majority of members in the science community worldwide, the topic is politically charged in the United States, polarizing politicians as well as average people for or against taking actions to mitigate potential damages.\n\nJackson believes that Americans would do better to explore how action on the issue can improve areas of shared values.\n\n\"When you walk down a street and smell a natural gas leak, you are thinking about safety, not climate. Our mapping of street leaks showed cities that replaced all of their century-old cast-iron and unprotected steel pipes had a tenth the leaks of other cities. Based in part on our work, (U.S. state of) Massachusetts passed an accelerated pipeline replacement program a few years ago. Costing households only a dollar a month, it will reduce leaks and greenhouse gas emissions and make the system safer from the risks of fire and explosion,\" he told Stanford Report.\n\nAsked about pending environmental decisions in which the conversation about climate change fails to account properly for the kinds of shared values, the chair of the Stanford Department of Earth System Science cited the current U.S. administration's threat to cut fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as a example because, although it is often discussed in terms of climate change, it also impacts finance, health and security. \"Consumer Reports estimates people will save about 4,500 dollars over the life of their car once the standards are fully implemented.\n\nHalf of Americans live in towns and cities that don't meet air quality standards, caused in part by ozone and particulate pollution from cars and trucks.\"\n\n\"We can cut through stereotypes by discussing what people value. Jobs are a good example. In the electricity sector, there are 475,000 people working in the solar and wind industries, three times more than in coal and natural gas combined,\" he noted, adding that \"solar and wind power created an astonishing 100,000 new jobs last year.

And according to a 2011 study, sea level rise could displace nearly 190 million people by the end of the century around the world.\n\nAlthough 72 percent of beaches in Southern California show historical trends of accretion or getting larger, due to large artificial beach nourishments since the 1930s, future predictions indicate that nearly all of the beaches will experience erosion due to accelerated sea-level rise, according to the study."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "US Remembers its Veterans", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/us-remembers-its-veterans/4653855.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:29", "body_paragraphs": "The United States is observing Veterans Day on Sunday, the annual day it stops to remember the millions of men and women who have served in the country's armed forces, often at the sacrifice of their own lives.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in Paris, said on Twitter, \"On this Veterans Day \u2014 the 100th Anniversary of the end of WWI, we honor the brave HEROES who fought for America in the Great War, and every Veteran who has worn the uniform and kept our Nation Safe, Strong and FREE!\"\n\nIn his Veterans Day message, former President Barack Obama tweeted, \u201cTo all our veterans and your families: thank you.

Thousands of people have evacuated with what little of their life's possession they could escape with.\n\nAuthorities say one of the California wildfires is about 20 percent contained and the other only five percent.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire and the Hill Fire in southern California, and the Camp Fire, in the northern part of the state, erupted Thursday fueled by drought conditions and wind.\n\nOfficials said the Camp Fire has become the most destructive wildfire in state history, and the third deadliest.\n\nPreviously, the Tubbs Fire, which burned nearly 16,000 hectares in Lake, Napa, and Sonoma counties in 2017, had been considered the most destructive wildfire in state history. The Tubbs Fire killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,500 structures.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's office said the Camp Fire victims were mostly found dead inside or near their cars. The sudden evacuation led to highway gridlock, forcing some to flee on foot.\n\nOfficials said the fire has destroyed 6,453 homes and another 260 commercial structures and has grown to 404 square kilometers.\n\nThe blaze nearly quadrupled Thursday into Friday. Officials say the blaze is only five percent contained.\n\n\n\nDozens of people are reported missing.\n\nEvacuations were ordered for the east side of the neighboring town of Chico, a city of about 93,000 people, as flames from the blaze were being driven by 56 kph winds.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire is threatening about 75,000 homes in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles.\n\nTwo arrests were made for looting in Ventura County.\n\nL.A.

Get Smart!\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nEarlier, he warned California residents that the \"fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). If people don't evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire. Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials!\"\n\nHe said 4,000 firefighters are battling the Camp and Woolsey fires that had burned nearly 70,000 hectares. \"Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated,\" and the families of those who have been killed. \"The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all.\"\n\nBut he contended, \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\n\nBut authorities in California disputed Trump's assessment.\n\nBrian Rice, president of California Professional Firefighters, said, \"...nearly 60 percent of California forests are under federal management ... It is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management, not California ... At this desperate time, we would encourage the president to offer support in word and deed, instead of recrimination and blame.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Rice told CNN that Trump's statement was \"stupid\" and \"callous\" and did not take into account California's seven-year drought.\n\nLeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire scientist at University of California Merced, told the San Francisco Chronicle Trump's tweets oversimplified the issue in California.\n\n\"To have a president come out and say it's all because of forest management is ridiculous. It completely ignores the dynamic of what's going on around us,\" he told the Chronicle. He said rising temperatures and longer spells of dry weather were behind an increase in not only the number of wildfires but their ferocity as well."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "country_US", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zq$omekvi_", "title": "Topless Female Protesters Approach Trump Motorcade in Paris", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/topless-female-protesters-approach-trump-motorcade-in-paris/4653610.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:32", "body_paragraphs": "French police arrested two topless female protesters Sunday on the Champs-Elysees where France was holding a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War.\n\nOne of the women was apprehended within just a few meters of the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump as it approached the site.

He had no role in the studies or ties to the companies involved.\n\nResults were revealed Saturday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAbout fish oil\n\nThese oils, also called omega-3 fatty acids, are found in salmon, tuna and certain other fish. They reduce triglycerides and inflammation and may have other effects. There are different types, including EPA and DHA.\n\nOne study tested 4 grams a day of Amarin Corp.'s prescription Vascepa, which is concentrated EPA, in more than 8,000 patients with high triglycerides and a greater risk of heart problems for various reasons. All were already taking a statin such as Lipitor or Zocor to lower cholesterol. Half were given Vascepa and the rest, mineral oil capsules as a comparison.\n\nAfter five years, about 17 percent of those on Vascepa had suffered one of these problems -- a heart attack, stroke, heart-related death or clogged arteries requiring medical care -- versus 22 percent of the others.\n\nThat worked out to a 25 percent reduction in risk. Looked at individually, heart attacks, heart-related deaths and strokes all were lower with Vascepa. Only 21 people would need to take Vascepa for five years to prevent one of the main problems studied -- favorable odds, Stein said.\n\nSide effects may be a concern: More people on Vascepa were hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat -- 3 percent versus 2 percent of the comparison group. Doctors say that's puzzling because other research suggests fish oil lowers that risk.\n\nThe concern with the heart rhythm problem is that it can raise the risk of stroke, but there were fewer strokes among those on Vascepa, said study leader Dr. Deepak Bhatt of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nVascepa costs around $280 a month; many insurers cover it. Amarin sponsored the study and some study leaders work or consult for the company.\n\nThe other study tested a lower 1 gram daily dose of a different type of fish oil -- an EPA/DHA combo sold as Lovaza or Omacor and in generic form -- in 26,000 people with no prior heart problems or cancer.\n\nAfter about five years, rates of a combined measure of heart attacks, strokes and other problems were similar for fish oil users and a comparison group. Cancer rates and deaths also were similar.\n\nThere were fewer heart attacks in the fish oil group -- 145 versus 200 in the comparison group. The study leader, Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's, called that \"a substantial benefit,'' but several independent experts disagreed because of the way the study was set up to track this and certain other results.\n\n\"These findings are speculative and would need to be confirmed in a separate trial,'' said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen.\n\nFishy comparisons?\n\nBoth studies share a problem: the oils used for the comparison groups, which may not have been true placebos. The Vascepa study used mineral oil, which interferes with statin drugs, raises cholesterol, and might have made the comparison group fare worse and made Vascepa look better than it truly was.\n\nThe other study used olive oil, which might have helped that comparison group do better, possibly masking any benefit to the others from fish oil.\n\nLeaders of both studies say any effect from the comparison oils isn't enough to alter the main results, and independent experts agreed. But Nissen, who is leading another fish oil study, is using corn oil as a comparison.\n\nThe 'sunshine' vitamin\n\nManson's study also tested vitamin D, which the skin makes from sun exposure. It's tough to get enough from foods like milk, eggs and oily fish, though many foods now are fortified with it. Some studies have found that people with lower levels of D are more likely to develop cancer, but it's not known if supplements alter that risk.\n\nStudy participants took 2,000 international units of D-3 (the most active form of vitamin D, also called cholecalciferol) or fake vitamin pills for five years.\n\nVitamin D did not affect the odds of having a heart attack or stroke or developing cancer. After excluding the first two years of use, researchers saw fewer cancer deaths among those on the vitamin -- 112 versus 149 in the placebo group.\n\n\"Cancer can take years to develop'' so a difference may not show up right away, Manson said. \"This looks promising'' and people will be studied longer to see if the trend holds up, she said.\n\nSeveral other experts said these numbers just hint at a possible benefit that needs more study.\n\n\"These 'positive' results need to be interpreted with caution,'' Dr. Clifford Rosen of Maine Medical Center Research Institute and Dr. John Keaney Jr. of the University of Massachusetts wrote in a commentary in the medical journal."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "health", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zt$opeitim", "title": "Uganda Readies to Stave Off Ebola Along DRC Border", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-ebola-drc-border/4653039.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:38", "body_paragraphs": "In Uganda, officials have stepped up measures to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

That term, ecologically valid, means that the research attempts to mimic real life.\n\nThe study divided the participants into two groups: The first group was allowed to maintain their normal social media habits. The other, the control group, was restricted to 10 minutes per day on each of the three platforms: Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram.\n\nThe restrictions were put in place for three weeks and then the participants returned and were tested for outcomes such as fear of missing out (FOMO), anxiety, depression and loneliness.\n\n\u200bResults of study\n\nThe results showed a very clear link between social media use and increased levels of depression and loneliness.\n\n\u201cUsing less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThese effects are particularly pronounced for folks who were more depressed when they came into the study.\u201d\n\nShe calls her findings the \u201cgrand irony\u201d of social media.\n\nWhat is it about social media that\u2019s just so depressing?\n\nHunt says that it\u2019s two major things. The first is that social media invites what Hunt calls \u201cdownward social comparison.\u201d When you\u2019re online, it can sometimes seem that \u201ceveryone else is cooler and having more fun and included in more things and you\u2019re left out,\u201d she said. And that\u2019s just generally demoralizing.\n\nThe second factor is a bit more nuanced.\n\n\u201cTime is a zero-sum game,\u201d Hunt told VOA. \u201cEvery minute you spend online is a minute you are not doing your work or not meeting a friend for dinner or having a deep conversation with your roommate.\u201d\n\nAnd these real life activities are the ones that can bolster self-esteem and self worth, Hunt said.\n\nWhat to learn\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway?\n\nPeople are on their devices, and that\u2019s not going to change, she said. But as in life, a bit of moderation goes a long way.\n\n\u201cIn general, I would say, put your phone down and be with the people in your life,\u201d she added.\n\nHunt pointed out a few caveats to the study. First, it was done exclusively with 18- to 22-year-olds, and it is unclear if the depressing effects of social media will cross generational lines to older or younger people, Hunt said. But she expects her results should generalize at least for people through the age of 30.\n\nHunt says she is now beginning a study to gauge the emotional impact of dating apps."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "For Autistic Kids, Robots Can Be Social, Learning Study Buddy", "article_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/for-autistic-kids-robots-can-be-social-skills-learning-study-buddy/4652742.html", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:39", "body_paragraphs": "Robots have been put to work assembling cars in factories, answering questions at conventions and hotel lobbies, moving packages in warehouses, and more.

The note of contrition came a week after the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest management's treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct involving men. The protest's organizers estimated about 17,000 workers participated in the walkout .\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" Pichai wrote in his email. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Pichai's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional under the new policies. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after the complaints of its women employees prompted an internal investigation concluding its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment\n\nGoogle will also provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct, requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in their annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their women subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already openly acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest paying executive and computer programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance as created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\nGoogle isn't addressing another one of the protesters' grievance because it believes it doesn't have merit. The protesters demanded that women be paid the same as men for doing similar work, something that Google has steadfastly maintained that it has been doing for years."}, {"site": "voiceOfAmerica", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.voanews.com/api/zyritequir", "title": "Bullied Online?

What info I could gather intrigued me, especially the circumstances on which they built their team: a less-than-shoestring budget, practice on frozen ponds, borrowed equipment, the sport having almost no recognition outside Ladakh.\u201d\n\nWhen he arrived, he was also struck by the gender barriers the women had broken. In addition to the usual challenges athletes face when they\u2019re pursuing an underfunded sport, the women of Ladakh also faced obstacles from their male counterparts, who temporarily barred women from competing.\n\n\u201cFor most of its history there, ice hockey was not just a man\u2019s domain but really a cultural, if not civic, cornerstone. What struck me the most was that in less than a generation, a fairly small pool of young women broke into this institution, powered through these various obstacles to form an internationally successful team, and ultimately became heroes of sorts for this entire region,\u201d he said.\n\nIn \u201cCool Runnings\u201d fashion, the women have emerged as respected contenders on the international stage and have received visits from the likes of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and four-time Olympic ice hockey gold medallist Hayley Wickenheiser.\n\nIt\u2019s an inspiring story adorned with the sort of photos (of makeshift ice rinks and Himalayan landscapes) you can spend a long time staring at.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEmily\n\nFor more great stories from India, follow @HuffPostIndia.

Sometimes I get trigger point injections \u2015 shots of lidocaine into my muscles to stop them from spasming, a frequent occurrence due to my degenerative collagen disorder. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also causes my joints to frequently dislocate, randomly and without warning, causing severe and constant pain.\n\nBut the main reason I make this 40-minute drive every month is to pick up a paper prescription for my pain meds; they\u2019re considered a controlled substance, so the law forbids me from refilling them digitally. And every time I make the trip, I\u2019m reminded that even the medical world isn\u2019t designed for sick people like me.\n\nIt starts when I pull into the parking lot and decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, even though I\u2019d obviously rather use it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether my hips are dislocated that day or not; I never use my wheelchair here.\n\nThe building has an elevator I can take to the second-floor office, but it shudders and judders the whole way up, so I use the stairs. I\u2019m then met with two heavy glass doors, and if I were sitting in my chair, the handles would be too high to reach, the doors too heavy to hold. The fact there isn\u2019t an automatic door opener here has always struck me as strange.\n\nIn the waiting room, there\u2019s no space to park myself when seated in my wheelchair; I\u2019d end up inevitably being tripped on. Plus, the doorway between the waiting room and exam rooms is so narrow that wheeling through would be an impossibility (and no automatic door openers here, either). The exam tables aren\u2019t equipped to motor down to my level, which means I\u2019d have to stand up out of my chair to clamber onto the table. The entire experience would be an effort in exhaustion and inaccessibility, so I tough it out on foot instead.\n\nIn many ways, I\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine. As a partially ambulatory disabled patient with a host of chronic health conditions, I regularly run into what feels like a never-ending gamut of issues every time I visit one of my practitioners. And I\u2019m far from the exception to the rule.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate I can decide to leave my wheelchair in the car, because a depressingly high level of inaccessibility has become the norm when it comes to 21st century medicine.\n\nInaccessibility issues often start long before disabled patients make it to their appointments. I can drive myself most days or schedule my appointments when my fianc\u00e9 can drive me \u2015 and good thing, because I am never asked or given recommendations about transportation (except to be told I can\u2019t drive myself home post-anesthesia). Patients with disabilities who aren\u2019t partially ambulatory like I am often have to figure out the logistics on their own, which means complicated mass transit systems or paying out of pocket for paratransit rides. Paratransit riders often have to book 24 hours in advance, usually by telephone, and most agencies make riders pay with cash or a paper voucher. If a patient is d/Deaf, they might need a teleprinter/teletypewriter \u2015 a specialized text telephone that doesn\u2019t come cheap \u2015 to schedule the ride. Requiring cash payment means disabled people now have to take the additional step of making a separate trip to the bank in order to be able to pay.\n\nAnd before you suggest them, ridesharing options like Lyft or Uber are a far cry from a solution. They\u2019re often either inaccessible or rife with discrimination. Uber was sued in 2018 for its fleet\u2019s lack of wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Another 2018 study found that Lyft provided a wheelchair-accessible vehicle in only three of 65 attempts to request one \u2015 a disturbing 95 percent failure rate. Uber managed only 27 out of 49 attempts for a WAV. In all, researchers located a WAV in just 26 percent of attempts (compared with a 100 percent success rate for non-accessible vehicles).\n\nMedical offices themselves are an issue, too, as is the equipment inside them. Disabled patients often have difficulty using X-ray machines, rehab equipment, scales, scanning devices like MRIs and even just getting up on exam tables. Federal civil rights laws require medical offices to be accessible, but few are \u2014 and the ones that exist are hard to find. A 2012 study of 2,389 primary care facilities in California found that a mere 8 percent were equipped with a height-adjustable exam table, and less than 4 percent had an accessible weight scale. A 2013 telephone survey of 256 specialty offices across four U.S. cities for a fictional wheelchair-using patient found that 22 percent of practices reported they couldn\u2019t accommodate the patient. Amazingly, the clinicians who refused to accommodate the fictional patient also failed to recognize that their refusal was illegal under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us.\n\nThose very same ADA laws also mandate that hospitals receiving federal funding provide deaf patients with help to ensure effective communication. However, while I frequently see hospital signs declaring patients have easy access to other language interpreters, I\u2019ve never seen one mentioning the availability of an American Sign Language interpreter. And, as a patient, I\u2019m never asked about any hearing issues, even though I\u2019m hard of hearing as a result of jaw surgery in 2013 (and far too many rock concerts without earplugs). I\u2019m rarely offered alternatives to spoken communication, like written pamphlets, and I am never asked about learning disabilities like dyscalculia, dyslexia or auditory processing disorders.\n\nDoctors carry their own deeply ingrained assumptions about disability, and non-disabled doctors simply lack the understanding of what living with a disability actually entails. Research has shown that, as a result, disabled patients receive inferior health care, including less information about prevention and fewer screening tests, such as Pap tests and mammograms. A 2006 study showed disabled women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely than non-disabled women to undergo breast-conserving surgery. Those who did were still less likely to receive standard radiation therapy. Unsurprisingly, disabled people diagnosed with such cancers were significantly more likely to die as a result.\n\nPatients with intellectual disabilities (whether the diagnosis is accurate or not) are significantly more vulnerable in medical settings than the general population, and their decreased life expectancy reflects that reality. Studies show that less than 20 percent of medical schools teach their students how to talk with intellectually disabled patients about their needs. Delays or problems with diagnosis or treatment are the No. 1 reason why individuals with intellectual disabilities die at least a decade earlier than non-disabled patients on average.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability. And as with so many issues involving disabled people, we have to start at the beginning to enact fixes. Disabled people need to be involved from the ground up. This means medical schools need to offer clear instruction that teaches future doctors how to interact with and examine disabled patients, but it also means that medical schools need to be more accessible when including and training disabled students to become future doctors. More disabled doctors mean a more widespread need and appreciation for accessibility \u2015 for patients and for those giving care, too.\n\nInaccessibility and ableism are the name of the game when you\u2019re a chronically ill patient with a disability.\n\nAs usual, this means our world as a whole needs to place a much higher focus on making the world more accessible. I\u2019ve written before about how music venues and airline travel are widely inaccessible to wheelchair users, and medicine is no different. Our society hasn\u2019t yet insisted upon accessibility as a bare minimum, and disabled humans suffer as a result. It\u2019s an ouroboros of epic proportions: Disabled people are forcibly excluded, which is why non-disabled people don\u2019t think to include us. It often starts in preschool or elementary school, when the buildings are inaccessible, and continues through high school and extends into higher ed. When we can\u2019t pursue higher levels of education, we are excluded from job opportunities. Exclusion from job opportunities means we aren\u2019t the ones in medical school, insisting upon education about how to properly treat us \u2014 and we aren\u2019t the architects helping design accessible hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices, either.\n\nDisabled people make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, but 20 percent isn\u2019t enough to enact change, no matter how loud we\u2019re yelling. We need non-disabled people to join the rallying cry. If you aren\u2019t disabled and haven\u2019t thought about these issues before, it\u2019s time to take a look around. After all, disability is eventually guaranteed to all of us. Old age will alter your mobility, your functionality, your ability to move and your autonomy. At some point, the heavy glass doors at your doctor\u2019s office will stymy you, too.

They would be the first humans on the list, which classifies endangered, threatened and vulnerable animal species around the globe.\n\nA video from the advocacy group (see above) makes its point in part by dressing individuals with Down syndrome in costumes resembling such endangered, threatened and vulnerable species as polar bears, lions and rhinos.\n\nThe campaign is a reaction to the fact that genetic screening has led to a significant decrease in people born with Down syndrome.\n\nSince the prenatal tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, for example, almost 100 percent of women who received a positive test for Down syndrome opted for an abortion, according to CBS. As a result, the condition has been almost completely disappeared from Iceland\u2019s younger population.\n\nSome people may believe that eradicating the condition is a good thing. But advocates argue that this kind of attitude contributes to a stigma that people with Down Syndrome are lesser humans. And that kind of thinking impacts societal awareness, funding and job opportunities for those who have Down syndrome and desperately need aid \u2014 hence the campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s underfunded support programs for education, higher rates of unemployment, extended waitlists for appropriate housing, or even just negative public perception and stigma, the challenges faced by people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t decreasing \u2014 they\u2019re increasing,\u201d Laura LaChance, the board chair for the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, said in a press release.\n\nThe group told HuffPost Canada that by pushing to add people with Down syndrome to the endangered species list, it\u2019s advocating for the same kinds of \u201cfunding, protections, government intervention and public awareness that species on the Endangered List receive.\u201d\n\nMany people still found the campaign\u2019s comparison of humans to animals dehumanizing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine folks with Down Syndrome would want to be considered a separate species.

Because we don\u2019t talk about it. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nAfter that miscarriage, she and her husband went on to conceive their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, through in vitro fertilization \u2015 a medical procedure in which eggs are extracted from a woman\u2019s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory to create embryos. If viable embryos are created, they are transferred back into the woman\u2019s body to establish a pregnancy.\n\nObama hinted in the ABC interview that the couple turned to IVF due to an issue with egg quality.\n\n\u201cThe biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized that as I was 34 and 35 \u2015 we had to do IVF.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for people facing infertility problems say that the revelation from one of the most admired women in America will help others feel less alone.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Stacey Edwards-Dunn, founder of the education and advocacy organization Fertility for Colored Girls, said that Obama\u2019s disclosure could give hope to other women of color who may be struggling alone with their infertility.\n\n\u201cSo many black women [and] couples live in silence and shame for so many reasons, including myths and misconceptions about black women being hyper-fertile,\u201d Edwards-Dunn said. \u201c[Michelle Obama] just gave so many women permission to exhale and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alone, and I too can get support and help to become a parent!\u2019\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s story will open up more conversations about infertility and black women, said Edwards-Dunn, who has gone through seven IVF cycles herself and now has a 4-year-old child conceived from the treatments.\n\n\u201cNot only is this the first time that we hear of a first lady being so transparent about her personal fertility challenges, but her courageous truth-telling gives more women, particularly black women and couples, the courage to talk about their own challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Aaron Styer, an African-American reproductive endocrinologist and founding partner of the fertility clinic CCRM Boston, said this could encourage more couples to visit a doctor.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most respected and revered women of color, Michelle Obama\u2019s openness to discuss her IVF treatments will open that dialogue and empower black women and all women, men, and couples facing infertility to seek these treatments to conceive,\u201d he said.\n\nBarbara Collura, president of the infertility advocacy group RESOLVE, similarly hopes that Obama\u2019s news might inspire others to act.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day impact really happens when people who care about this issue talk to their employers about adding family building benefits to help them, when they talk to their lawmakers about policy change, and when we as a community make sure that anyone struggling to build a family has access to information and support,\u201d said Collura.\n\nInfertility can strike all races, ethnicities and economic groups. Overall, about 12 percent of women in the U.S. have problems either getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term.\n\nBut black women have higher rates of infertility (defined as unprotected sex with a man for more than one year without a pregnancy) and higher rates of pregnancy loss between 10 and 20 weeks gestation. The cause may be a complex mix of medical issues including higher rates of fibroids, obesity, and blocked fallopian tubes \u2015 all factors that can affect fertility, said Styer.\n\nBlack women are also less likely than other groups to seek medical help for infertility. A 2015 study surveying 300 reproductive-age women with infertility found that black women were less likely to visit a doctor for help getting pregnant and that they waited twice as long as white women before seeking help.\n\nResearchers say this is the result of both cultural and practical barriers to medical care. There is some evidence that black women in particular feel they can\u2019t reach out for support and experience shame about their condition because of the expectation (and stigma) that black women are especially fertile.\n\nBut the most significant problem may be rooted in more practical concerns: Black women trying to get infertility treatment say it\u2019s more difficult for them to get doctor\u2019s appointments, take time off from work and pay for treatment.\n\nIVF is a common medical treatment, and more than one million babies have been born in the U.S. thanks to the technology. But most people who have fertility issues will never be able to access this or other treatments. Among women interviewed for the 2006\u20132010 National Survey of Family Growth, only 3.1 percent of those with fertility issues had ever used assisted reproductive technology like IVF.\n\nThis could be because the average couple going through IVF will spend more than $24,000 in an 18-month period. And this is likely to be an out-of-pocket cost, as infertility treatment is generally not covered by insurance.\n\nEven when black women are able to seek help, the best treatments that medical science has for infertility don\u2019t seem to work as well with them. A study of about 4,000 women undergoing their first IVF cycle found that black women had lower odds of achieving a pregnancy and a live birth compared to white women, along with higher rates of miscarriage.\n\nStill, fingers are crossed that Obama\u2019s disclosure will at least drive more women of color to consult with fertility clinics \u2015 just as Angelina Jolie\u2019s 2013 New York Times op-ed caused a spike in genetic testing for breast cancer."}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Gab, Social Network Favored By The Far Right, Goes Back Online", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gab-back-online_us_5be01052e4b09d43e32099a9", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Gab, a social network popular among alt-right activists and white nationalists, went back online Sunday after having gone dark following the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people.\n\nThe platform, a self-labeled champion of free speech, was dropped by domain provider GoDaddy.com last week.

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race \u2015 or anything, really \u2015 has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they\u2019ll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it\u2019s just part of internet life mean that it\u2019s critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They\u2019ll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it\u2019s hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they\u2019re drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment \u2015 unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what\u2019s OK and what\u2019s absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today\u2019s kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech \u2015 which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can\u2019t stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The internet didn\u2019t create hate speech. Although it may change some people\u2019s minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn\u2019t account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people \u2015 and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can\u2019t \u2015 and shouldn\u2019t \u2015 rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don\u2019t have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family\u2019s values \u2015 around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other \u2015 sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.\n\nConversation starters\n\nWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word, or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?\n\nHow does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you\u2019re exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses \u2015 for example, a popular kid vs. a loner type \u2015 affected differently?\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone, or knows that they\u2019re hurting someone, and does it repeatedly, that\u2019s cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group, that\u2019s hate speech.\n\nWhat\u2019s your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that, or would it make you feel uncool \u2015 like you\u2019re not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?\n\nHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people\u2019s feelings are hurt or they\u2019re offended, they can just go on a different site, right?\n\nDoes hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylan Roof, accused murderer Robert Bowers, and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online, even if they\u2019re offensive and threatening? Or not?\n\nWhat responsibility \u2015 if any \u2015 do technology platforms have? Should Instagram, for example, be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together, either through dedicated spaces, new algorithms, or other methods?\n\nWhy are certain people attracted to hate groups? It\u2019s natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups, and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?\n\nPractical ways to manage hate speech"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Google Employees Stage Global Walkout Over Payouts To Alleged Sexual Harassers", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-walkout-sexual-harassment_us_5bd9bbdbe4b0da7bfc15e15d", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "NEW YORK \u2015 Google employees around the globe staged a walkout Thursday to protest the tech giant\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, prompted by a bombshell New York Times report last week that Google quietly offered several high-profile executives lucrative exit packages after they were accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe action, floated last weekend on an internal message board by a group of female engineers, grew past its 200 organizers and became a massive worldwide event in just a handful of days.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the discontent in an email to employees Tuesday, pledging the company would take a \u201cmuch harder line on inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d is a reference to Android creator Andy Rubin, who the Times revealed was quietly given a $90 million golden parachute after the company discovered he allegedly coerced a woman into performing oral sex at a hotel in 2013.

There\u2019s such a company culture that\u2019s so welcoming and inclusive,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd then to see that not only that happened but that so much money was used to cover it up \u2015 I felt shameful. I felt like this company that I really love working for was doing something really terrible, and I think the right thing to do was to stand up and say something.\u201d"}, {"site": "huffPost", "category": "tech", "feed_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/technology/feed", "title": "Inventor Of World Wide Web Says Tech Giants May Have To Be Split Up", "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inventor-of-world-wide-web-says-tech-giants-may-have-to-be-split-up_us_5bdaf5b7e4b019a7ab5ab55c", "accessed_time": "2018-11-11 19:01:47", "body_paragraphs": "Simon Dawson / Reuters World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee speaks during an interview ahead of a speech at the Mozilla Festival 2018 in London, Britain, on October 27, 2018.
